      <title>Star Log-extended eMulation: a method for efficient computation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10556v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We emulate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, including tidal deformability, for neutron stars using a novel hybrid method based upon the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for the first time. This new method, which we call Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic behavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the nonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations of state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric Quarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of $\approx 3 \times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using standard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous TOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer constraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM algorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent neutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in computationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of EOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly available in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use.</description>

      <title>McFACTS II: Mass Ratio--Effective Spin Relationship of Black Hole Mergers in the AGN Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Monte Carlo For AGN (active galactic nucleus) Channel Testing and Simulation (McFACTS, https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts) code to study the effect of AGN disk and nuclear star cluster parameters on predicted mass distributions for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) compact binaries forming in AGN disks. The assumptions we vary include the black hole (BH) initial mass function, disk model, disk size, disk lifetime, and the prograde-to-retrograde fraction of newly formed black hole binaries. Broadly we find that dense, moderately short-lived AGN disks are preferred for producing a $(q,\chi_{\rm eff})$ anti-correlation like those identified from existing gravitational wave (GW) observations. Additionally, a BH initial mass function (MF $\propto M^{-2}$) is preferred over a more top-heavy MF ($M^{-1}$). The preferred fraction of prograde-to-retrograde is $&gt;90\%$, to produce results consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Bulk Motions in the Black Hole Jet Sheath as a Candidate for the Comptonizing Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of two-dimensional general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the properties of the sheath separating the black hole jet from the surrounding medium. We find that the electromagnetic power flowing through the jet sheath is comparable to the overall accretion power, and is an important site of energy dissipation as revealed by the copious appearance of reconnection layers and plasmoid chains: $\sim20\%$ of the radially flowing electromagnetic power is found to be dissipated between 2 and 10 $R_{\rm g}$. The plasma in these dissipation regions moves along a nearly paraboloidal surface with trans-relativistic bulk motions dominated by the radial component, whose dimensionless 4-velocity is $\sim1.2\pm0.5$. In the frame moving with the mean (radially-dependent) velocity, the distribution of stochastic bulk motions resembles a Maxwellian with an `effective bulk temperature' of $\sim$100 keV. Scaling the global simulation to Cygnus X-1 parameters gives a rough estimate of the Thomson optical depth across the jet sheath $\sim0.01-0.1$, and it may increase in future magnetohydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent radiative losses. These properties suggest that the dissipative jet sheath may be a viable `coronal' region, capable of upscattering seed thermal X-ray photons ($\sim$1 keV) into a hard, nonthermal tail, as seen during the hard states of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Analysis of GRB Closure Relationship in Multi-wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense pulses of high-energy emission associated with massive stars' death or compact objects' coalescence. Their multi-wavelength observations help verify the reliability of the standard fireball model. We analyze 14 GRBs observed contemporaneously in gamma-rays by the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), in X-rays by the \textit{Swift} Telescope, and in the optical bands by \textit{Swift} and many ground-based telescopes. We study the correlation between the spectral and temporal indices using closure relations according to the synchrotron forward-shock model in the stratified medium ($n \propto r^{-k}$) with $k$ ranging from 0 to 2.5. We find that the model without energy injection is preferred over the one with energy injection in all the investigated wavelengths. In gamma-rays, we only explored the $\nu &gt; $ max\{$\nu_c,\nu_m$\} (SC/FC) cooling condition (where $\nu_c$ and $\nu_m$ are the cooling and characteristic frequencies, namely the frequencies at the spectral break). In the X-ray and optical bands, we explored all the cooling conditions, including $\nu_m &lt; \nu &lt; \nu_c$ (SC), $\nu_c &lt; \nu &lt; \nu_m$ (FC), and SC/FC, and found a clear preference for SC for X-rays and SC/FC for optical. Within these cooling conditions, X-rays exhibit the highest rate of occurrence for the density profile with $k = 0$, while the optical band has the highest occurrence for $k$ = 2.5 when considering no energy injection. Although we can pinpoint a definite environment for some GRBs, we find degeneracies in other GRBs.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Powered Stars and the High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) result from stars being gravitationally-scattered into low angular momentum orbits around massive black holes. We show that the short lifetimes of massive Population III stars at high redshifts could significantly suppress the volumetric TDE rate because they are too short-lived to reach disruption-fated orbits. However, this suppression can be alleviated if captured dark matter (DM) within stellar interiors provides an additional energy source, thereby extending stellar lifetimes. We find that this TDE rate revival is most pronounced for DM particles with mass $\mathcal{O}({\rm MeV})$, as this particle mass scale is optimal in the competing processes of DM accretion and evaporation in stars.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporal evolution of 4U 1702-429 using AstroSat-NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the broadband spectral and timing properties of the atoll source 4U 1702-429 using two observations of AstroSat with the second one having simultaneous NICER data. For both observations, the spectra can be represented by a Comptonizing medium with a black body seed photon source which can be identified with the surface of the neutron star. A disk emission along with a distant reflection is also required for both spectra. For the first observation, the coronal temperature ($\sim 7$ keV) is smaller than the second ($\sim 13$ keV), and the disk is truncated at a larger radius, $\sim 150$ km, compared to the second, $\sim 25$ km, for an assumed distance of 7 kpc. A kHz QPO at $\sim 800$ Hz is detected in the first and is absent in the second observation. Modeling the energy-dependent r.m.s and time lag of the kHz QPO reveals a corona size of $\leq$ 30 km. A similar model can explain the energy dependence of the broadband noise at $\sim 10$ Hz for the second observation. The results suggest that kHz QPOs are associated with a compact corona surrounding the neutron star and may occur when the disk is truncated at large distances. We emphasize the need for more wide-band observations of the source to confirm these results.</description>

      <title>NinjaSat monitoring of Type-I X-ray bursts from the clocked burster SRGA J144459.2$-$604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat was launched on 2023 November 11 and has provided opportunities for agile and flexible monitoring of bright X-ray sources. On 2024 February 23, the NinjaSat team started long-term observation of the new X-ray source SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 as the first scientific target, which was discovered on 2024 February 21 and recognized as the sixth clocked X-ray burster. Our 25-day observation covered almost the entire decay of this outburst from two days after the peak at $\sim$100 mCrab on February 23 until March 18 at a few mCrab level. The Gas Multiplier Counter onboard NinjaSat successfully detected 12 Type-I X-ray bursts with a typical burst duration of $\sim$20 s, shorter than other clocked burster systems. As the persistent X-ray emission declined by a factor of five, X-ray bursts showed a notable change in its morphology: the rise time became shorter from 4.4(7) s to 0.3(3) s (1$\sigma$ errors), and the peak amplitude increased by 44%. The burst recurrence time $\Delta t_{\rm rec}$ also became longer from 2 hr to 10 hr, following the relation of $\Delta t_{\rm rec} \propto F_{\rm per}^{-0.84}$, where $F_{\rm per}$ is the persistent X-ray flux, by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The short duration of bursts is explained by the He-enhanced composition of accretion matter and the relation between $\Delta t_{\textrm{rec}}$ and $F_{\rm per}$ by a massive neutron star. This study demonstrated that CubeSat pointing observations can provide valuable astronomical X-ray data.</description>

      <title>Evidence of non-Solar elemental composition in the clocked bursts from SRGA J144459.2$-$604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In February and March 2024, several Type I X-ray bursts from the accreting neutron star SRGA J144459.2$-$60420 were detected by multiple X-ray satellites, with the first reports coming from INTEGRAL and NinjaSat. These observations reveal that after exhibiting very regular behavior as a ``clocked" burster, the peak luminosity of the SRGA J144459.2$-$60420 X-ray bursts shows a gradual decline. The observed light curves exhibit a short plateau feature, potentially with a double peak, followed by a rapid decay in the tail-features unlike those seen in previously observed clocked bursters. In this study, we calculate a series of multizone X-ray burst models with various compositions of accreted matter, specifically varying the mass fractions of hydrogen ($X$), helium ($Y$), and heavier CNO elements or metallicity ($Z_{\rm CNO}$). We demonstrate that a model with higher $Z_{\rm CNO}$ and/or lower $X/Y$ compared to the solar values can reproduce the observed behavior of SRGA J144459.2$-$60420. Therefore, we propose that this new XRB is likely the first clocked burster with non-solar elemental compositions. Moreover, based on the X-ray burst light curve morphology in the decline phase observed by NinjaSat, a He-enhanced model with $X/Y \approx 1.5$ seems preferred over high-metallicity cases. We also give a brief discussion on the implications for the neutron star mass, binary star evolution, inclination angle, and the potential for a high-metallicity scenario, the last of which is closely related to the properties of the hot CNO cycle.</description>

      <title>Physics-driven Explosions of Stripped High-Mass Stars: Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra of Stripped-Envelope Supernovae with Broad Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) represent a significant fraction of core-collapse supernovae, arising from massive stars that have shed their hydrogen and, in some cases, helium envelopes. The origins and explosion mechanisms of SESNe remain a topic of active investigation. In this work, we employ radiative-transfer simulations to model the light curves and spectra of a set of explosions of single, solar-metallicity, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars with ejecta masses ranging from 4 to 11 Msun, that were computed from a turbulence-aided and neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. We analyze these synthetic observables to explore the impact of varying ejecta mass and helium content on observable features. We find that the light curve shape of these progenitors with high ejecta masses is consistent with observed SESNe with broad light curves but not the peak luminosities. The commonly used analytic formula based on rising bolometric light curves overestimates the ejecta mass of these high-initial-mass progenitor explosions by a factor up to 2.6. In contrast, the calibrated method by Haynie et al., which relies on late-time decay tails, reduces uncertainties to an average of 20% within the calibrated ejecta mass range.Spectroscopically, the He I 1.083 um line remains prominent even in models with as little as 0.02 Msun of helium. However, the strength of the optical He I lines is not directly proportional to the helium mass but instead depends on a complex interplay of factors such as 56Ni distribution, composition, and radiation field. Thus, producing realistic helium features requires detailed radiative transfer simulations for each new hydrodynamic model.</description>

      <title>Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets: I. Physical Origin of the Band Function and Application to GRBs 090926A, 131108A, and 160509A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation physics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question. Based on the simulation analysis and recent observations, it was proposed that GRB jets are composed of a narrow ultra-relativistic core surrounded by a wide sub-relativistic cocoon. We show that emission from the synchrotron radiations and the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process of shear-accelerated electrons in the mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region and internal-shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core is potentially explained the spectral characteristics of the prompt gamma-rays. Assuming an exponential-decay velocity profile, the shear flow in the MJC region can accelerate electrons up to $\gamma_{\rm e,\max} \sim 10^4$ for injected electrons with $\gamma_{\rm e,inject}=3 \times 10^2$, if its magnetic field strength ($B_{\rm cn}$) is $100$ G and its inner-edge velocity ($\beta_{\rm cn, 0}$) is 0.9c. The cooling of these electrons is dominated by the SSC process, and the emission flux peaks at the keV band. In addition, the energy flux of synchrotron radiations of internal-shock-accelerated electrons ($\gamma_e=10^{4}\sim 10^{5}$) peaks at around the keV$-$MeV band, assuming a bulk Lorentz factor of 300, a magnetic field strength of $\sim 10^{6}$ G for the jet core. Adding the flux from both the jet core and the MJC region, the total spectral energy distribution (SED) illustrates similar characteristics as the broadband observations of GRBs. The bimodal and Band-Cut spectra observed in GRBs 090926A, 131108A, and 160509A can be well fit with our model. The derived $B_{\rm cn}$ varies from 54 G to 450 G and $\beta_{\rm cn,0}=0. 83\sim 0.91$c.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray contributions from rapidly rotating stellar mass black holes: Cosmic Ray GeV to EeV proton and anti-proton sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Radio Super Novae (RSNe) a magnetic field of $(B \, \times \, r) \, = \, 10^{16.0 \pm 0.12} \, {\rm Gauss \, \times \, cm}$ is observed; these are the same numbers for Blue Super Giant (BSG) star explosions as for Red Super Giant (RSG) star explosions, despite their very different wind properties. The EHT data for M87 as well for low power radio galaxies all show consistency with just this value of the quantity $(B \, \times \, r )$, key for angular momentum and energy transport, and can be derived from the radio jet data. We interpret this as a property of the near surroundings of a black hole (BH) at near maximal rotation, independent of BH mass. In the commonly used green onion model, in which a $2 \, \pi$ flow changes over to a jet flow we interpret this as a wind emanating from the BH/accretion disk system and its surroundings. Near the BH collisions in the wind can produce a large fraction of anti-protons. In this scenario the cosmic Ray (CR) population from the wind/jet is proposed to be visible as EeV protons and anti-protons in the CR data to EeV energy, with a $E^{-7/3}$ spectrum. This can be connected to a concept of inner and outer Penrose zones in the ergo-region. The observed numbers for the magnetic field imply the Planck time as the governing time scale: A BH rotating near maximum can accept a proton per log bin of energy in an extended spectrum with the associated pions every Planck time.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Rapid Polarization Angle Variation During the 2022 Outburst of XTE J1701-462</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of the Comptonization corona in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries is still unclear. We conducted time-resolved polarimetric analysis of the archival observations of XTE J1701--462 obtained with the \textit{Imaging X-ray Polarimeter Explorer} during its 2022 outburst, and found that the polarization angle (PA) varied significantly with time when the source was in the normal branch (NB), with $67 \pm 8^{\circ}$ in the first epoch, $-34 \pm 8^{\circ}$ in the second, and $-58 \pm 8^{\circ}$ in the third, last epoch. Meanwhile, the polarization degree remained constant at around 2\%, above the minimum detectable polarization at the 99\% confidence level (MDP$_{99}$). The rapid PA variation causes depolarization in the time-averaged data, resulting in a nondetection as reported in the literature. The rapid (intra-day) PA variation may suggest that there is a fast transformation of the corona geometry, likely switching from a slab geometry to a more vertically extended spreading layer geometry, along with enhanced disk emission and reflection.</description>

      <title>The Study of Jet Formation Mechanism in Fermi Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of jet launching mainly comes from two mechanisms: the BZ mechanism and the BP mechanism. However, it is in debate which one is dominating in blazars. In this work, we used a sample of 937 Fermi blazars to study the jet formation mechanism. We studied the correlation between the jet power and the accretion rate, as well as the comparison between jet power estimated by spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and that estimated by theoretical formula and radio flux density. Our results suggest that there is no correlation between jet power estimated by SED fitting and the accretion rate for BL Lacs, while a positive and weak correlation exists for flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Meanwhile, to confirm whether the BP and BZ mechanism is sufficient to launch the jet for FSRQs and BL Lacs, we compare the theoretical jet power with that estimated by SED fitting, as well as that by radio emission. We found that the jet power for most of the two subclasses estimated by SED fitting cannot be explained by either the BP or BZ mechanism. While the jet power for most FSRQs estimated by radio flux density can be explained by the BP mechanism, and most BL Lacs can be explained by the BZ mechanism. We also found that FSRQs have higher accretion rates than BL Lacs, implying different accretion disks around their central black holes: FSRQs typically have standard disks, while BL Lacs usually have advection-dominated accretion flow disks.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the LHAASO Galactic diffuse emission data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) collaboration has obtained a measurement of the gamma-ray diffuse emission in the ultra-high energy range, $10-10^3$ TeV after masking the contribution of known sources. The measurement appears to be 2-3 times higher than the gamma-ray signal expected from the hadronic interactions of diffuse cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, potentially suggesting a contribution from unresolved sources. However, estimates of the diffuse emission are affected by large uncertainties that must be accounted for. In this work, we calculate the hadronic gamma-ray diffuse emission including uncertainties in the gas content of the Galactic disk, in the energy and spatial distribution of cosmic rays as well as in the hadronic interaction cross-section. We show that the LHAASO data above $\sim 30$ TeV are consistent with the gamma-ray diffuse emission model when all these uncertainties are taken into account. This implies that, with the current data in this energy range, there is no need to invoke a cosmic ray spectral variation toward the Galactic center, nor a dominant contribution from unresolved sources.</description>

      <title>Velocity evolution of broad-line Ic supernovae with and without gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are more than 60 broad-line Ic (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) which are associated with a long Gamma-ray Burst (GRB). A large population of `ordinary' Ic-BLs for which no GRB component is detected also exists. On average, the expansion velocities of GRB-associated Ic-BLs exceed those of ordinary Ic-BLs. This work presents the largest spectroscopic sample of Ic-BL SNe with and without GRBs to date. The goal of this work is to investigate how the expansion velocities evolve in cases where an ultra-relativistic jet has been launched (GRB-SN cases) and compare these to Ic-BL SNe without a GRB detection. We measured the expansion velocities of the Fe II, Si II and Ca II lines observed in the spectra of Ic-BL SNe using a spline fitting method. We fit the expansion velocity evolution with single and broken power-laws. The expansion velocities of the Fe II and Si II features reveal considerable overlap between the two populations. It is not clear that GRB-associated supernovae expand more rapidly. Broken power-law evolution appears to be more common for the Si II feature, which always follows a shallow-steep decay, while the broken power-law Fe II decays are predominantly steep-shallow. The power-law indices for both samples were compared for both Fe II and Si II, and suggest that GRB-SNe decline at a similar rate to non-GRB Ic-BL supernovae. Neither the velocities nor their evolution can be used to distinguish between Ic-BLs with and without GRBs. Expansion velocities consistent with broken power-law evolution may indicate the presence of two velocity components, which may be evidence for a jet in some of these explosions. However, it is not possible to rule in or out the presence of a jet in any Ic-BL supernova purely based on the velocities. These results suggest that GRB-SNe and Ic-BLs are drawn from the same underlying population of events.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Modeling of Luminous Transients Powered by H-Rich and He-Rich Circumstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we perform detailed spectroscopic modeling to analyze the interaction of circumstellar material (CSM) with ejecta in both hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), systematically varying properties such as CSM density, composition, and geometry to explore their effects on spectral lines and light curve evolution. Using advanced radiative transfer simulations with the new, open-source SuperLite code to generate synthetic spectra, we identify key spectroscopic indicators of CSM characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that spectral lines of hydrogen and helium exhibit significant variations due to differences in CSM mass and composition. In hydrogen-rich SLSN- II, we observe pronounced hydrogen emission lines that correlate strongly with dense, extended CSM, suggesting massive, eruptive mass-loss histories. Conversely, in hydrogen-poor SLSNe, we recover mostly featureless spectra at early times, with weak hydrogen lines appearing only in the very early phases of the explosion, highlighting the quick ionization of traces of hydrogen present in the CSM. We analyze the properties of the resulting emission lines, particularly $\rm H_{\alpha}$ and $\rm H_{\beta}$, for our models using sophisticated statistical methods. This analysis reveals how variations in the supernova progenitor and CSM properties can lead to distinct spectroscopic evolutions over time. These temporal changes provide crucial insights into the underlying physics driving the explosion and the subsequent interaction with the CSM. By linking these spectroscopic observations to the initial properties of the progenitor and its surrounding ma</description>

      <title>Quantitative constraint on the contribution of resolved gamma-ray sources to the sub-PeV Galactic diffuse gamma-ray flux measured by the Tibet AS{\gamma} experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the difference between the fluxes of sub-PeV Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission (GDE) measured by the Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment and the LHAASO collaboration, our study constrains the contribution to the GDE flux measured by Tibet AS$\gamma$ from the sub-PeV gamma-ray sources in the first LHAASO catalog plus the Cygnus Cocoon. After removing the gamma-ray emission of the sources masked in the observation by Tibet AS$\gamma$, the contribution of the sources to the Tibet diffuse flux is found to be subdominant; in the sky region of $25^{\circ} &lt; l &lt; 100^{\circ}$ and $|b| &lt; 5^{\circ}$, it is less than 26.9% $\pm$ 9.9%, 34.8% $\pm$ 14.0%, and ${13.5%}^{+6.3%}_{-7.7%}$ at 121 TeV, 220 TeV, and 534 TeV, respectively. In the sky region of $50^{\circ} &lt; l &lt; 200^{\circ}$ and $|b| &lt; 5^{\circ}$, the fraction is less than 24.1% $\pm$ 9.5%, 27.1% $\pm$ 11.1% and ${13.5%}^{+6.2%}_{-7.6%}$. After subtracting the source contribution, the hadronic diffusive nature of the Tibet diffuse flux is the most natural interpretation, although some contributions from very faint unresolved hadronic gamma-ray sources cannot be ruled out. Different source-masking schemes adopted by Tibet AS$\gamma$ and LHAASO for their diffuse analyses result in different effective galactic latitudinal ranges of the sky regions observed by the two experiments. Our study concludes that the effect of the different source-masking schemes leads to the observed difference between the Tibet diffuse flux measured in $25^{\circ} &lt; l &lt; 100^{\circ}$ and $|b| &lt; 5^{\circ}$ and LHAASO diffuse flux in $15^{\circ} &lt; l &lt; 125^{\circ}$ and $|b| &lt; 5^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Observational features of the rotating Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing ray-tracing techniques, we investigate the shadow images of rotating Bardeen black holes surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. In this work, two models are considered for the background light source, namely the celestial light source model and the thin accretion disk model. Regarding the celestial light source, the investigation focuses on the impact of variations in relevant parameters and observed inclination on the contour and size of the shadow. For the thin accretion disk model, the optical appearance of a black hole is evidently contingent upon the radiative properties exhibited by the accretion disk, as well as factors such as observed inclination and relevant parameters governing spacetime. With an increasing observation inclination, the observed flux of direct and lensed images of the accretion disk gradually converge towards the lower region of the image, while an increase in the dark matter parameter $a$ significantly expands the region encompassing both direct and lensed images. Furthermore, the predominant effect is redshift at lower observation angles, whereas the blueshift effect only becomes apparent at higher observation angles. Simultaneously, the increase in the observation inclination will amplify the redshift effect, whereas an increase in the magnetic charge $\mathcal{G}$, rotation parameter $a$ and the absolute value of dark matter parameter $\alpha$ will attenuate the redshift effect observed in the image. These observations of a rotating Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter could provide a convenient way to distinguish it from other black hole models.</description>

      <title>Shadow Images of Ghosh-Kumar Rotating Black Hole Illuminated By Spherical Light Sources and Thin Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the astronomical implications of the Ghosh-Kumar rotating Black Hole (BH), particularly its behaviour on shadow images, illuminated by celestial light sources and equatorial thin accretion disks. Our research delineates a crucial correlation between dynamics of the shadow images and the parameters $a$,~ $q$ and the $\theta_{obs}$, which aptly reflect the influence of the model parameters on the optical features of shadow images. Initially, elevated behavior of both $a$ and $q$ transforms the geometry of the shadow images from perfect circles to an oval shape and converges them towards the centre of the screen. By imposing the backward ray-tracing method, we demonstrate the optical appearance of shadow images of the considering BH spacetime in the celestial light source. The results demonstrate that the Einstein ring shows a transition from an axisymmetric closed circle to an arc-like shape on the screen as well as producing the deformation on the shadow shape with the modifications of spacetime parameters at the fixed observational position. Next, we observe that the attributes of accretion disks along with the relevant parameters on the shadow images are illuminated by both prograde and retrograde accreting flow. Our study reveals the process by which the accretion disk transitions from a disk-like structure to a hat-like shape with the aid of observational angles. Moreover, with an increase of $q$, the observed flux of both direct and lensed images of the accretion disk gradually moves towards the lower zone of the screen. Furthermore, we present the intensity distribution of the redshift factors on the screen. Our analysis suggests that the observer can see both redshift and blueshift factors on the screen at higher observational angles, while augmenting the values of both $a$ and $q$, enhancing the effect of redshift on the screen.</description>

      <title>A Time-Dependent Spectral Analysis of $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the temporal and spectral features of $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae's X-ray emission within the context of the white dwarf accretion hypothesis. We find that the variabilities present in the X-ray data show two different signals, one primarily due to absorption and the other due to flickering like in non-magnetic cataclysmic variables. We then use this two-component insight to investigate previously un-reported simultaneous XMM and NuSTAR data. The model fitting results find white dwarf properties consistent with optical studies alongside a significant secondary, thermal source. We propose a secondary shock between the Be decretion disk and white dwarf accretion disk as the source. Finally, we analyzed a unique, low-count rate event of the XMM light curve as potential evidence for the white dwarf encountering Be decretion disk structures.</description>

      <title>Let there be neutrons! Hadronic photoproduction from a large flux of high-energy photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photo-hadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Searching for GeV Gamma-Ray Polarization and Axion-Like Particles with AMS-02</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the detectability of GeV-band gamma-ray polarization with the AMS-02 experiment and a proposed successor, from Galactic and extragalactic sources. Characterizing gamma-ray polarization in this energy range could shed light on gamma-ray emission mechanisms in the sources; physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the presence of axion-like particles (ALPs), could also induce a distinctive energy-dependent polarization signal due to propagation effects in magnetic fields. We present estimates for the minimum detectable polarization from bright sources and the forecast reach for axion-like particles (ALPs). We show that for an example bright extragalactic source (NGC1275), AMS-02 will only have sensitivity to ALP-induced polarization from currently open parameter space if the B-field configuration is unusually favorable to a signal. However, a successor experiment such as AMS-100 would be expected to probe new parameter space even for pessimistic B-field models, with prospects to measure the energy-dependence of such a signal. For Galactic sources, polarization measurements could provide a unique test of scenarios where ALPs induce energy-dependent features in the photon intensity. However, in the absence of a bright transient source (such as a Galactic supernova), the parameter space that would be probed by this approach with ten years of AMS-100 data is already nominally excluded by other experiments, although this conflict may be avoided in specific ALP models.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent thermodynamical treatment for quark matter in quasi-particle model at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the medium effects in strange quark matter in the framework of a grand-canonical ensemble using the phenomenological quasi-particle model. This model is studied with proper self-consistent thermodynamical treatment by incorporating chemical potential-dependent quark mass. We have also included the vector interaction in a self-consistent way. The main aim of this work is to explore the proper thermodynamic treatment in addressing the medium effects at both zero and finite temperatures. In the case of the finite temperature, we explore the study of self-consistent thermodynamics in the isothermal as well as the isentropic processes. The effect of finite temperature and lepton fraction have been studied on the equation of state, speed of sound, and particle fraction. The $M-R$ and $M-\Lambda$ diagrams are found to be consistent with the observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Probing the Formation of Megaparsec-scale Giant Radio Galaxies (I): Dynamical Insights from MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant radio galaxies (GRGs), a minority among the extended-jetted population, form in a wide range of jet and environmental configurations, complicating the identification of the growth factors that facilitate their attainment of megaparsec scales. This study aims to numerically investigate the hypothesized formation mechanisms of GRGs extending $\gtrsim 1$ Mpc to assess their general applicability. We employ triaxial ambient medium settings to generate varying levels of jet frustration and simulate jets with low and high power from different locations in the environment, formulating five representations. The emergence of distinct giant phases in all five simulated scenarios suggests that GRGs may be more common than previously believed, a prediction to be verified with contemporary radio telescopes. We find that different combinations of jet morphology, power, and the evolutionary age of the formed structure hold the potential to elucidate different formation scenarios. The simulated lobes are overpressured, prompting further investigation into pressure profiles when jet activity ceases, potentially distinguishing between relic and active GRGs. We observed a potential phase transition in giant radio galaxies, marked by differences in lobe expansion speed and pressure variations compared to their smaller evolutionary phases. This suggests the need for further investigation across a broader parameter space to determine if GRGs fundamentally differ from smaller RGs. Axial ratio analysis reveals self-similar expansion in rapidly propagating jets, with notable deviations when the jet forms wider lobes. Overall, this study emphasizes that multiple growth factors at work can better elucidate the current-day population of GRGs, including scenarios e.g., growth of GRGs in dense environments, GRGs of several megaparsecs, GRG development in low-powered jets, and the formation of X-shaped GRGs.</description>

Abstract: Parametrized nucleon density distributions are widely employed for the calculation of the properties of atomic nuclei and dense inhomogeneous matter in compact stars within the Thomas-Fermi method and its extensions. We show that the use of insufficiently smooth parametrizations may deteriorate the accuracy of this method. We discuss and clarify the smoothness condition using the example of the so-called "nuclear pasta" in the neutron star mantle.</description>

      <title>Continuous gravitational waves from thermal mountains on accreting neutron stars: effect of the nuclear pasta phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As density increases, the shape of nuclei transitions to non-spherical ``nuclear pasta" structures. The physical properties of the nuclear pasta, such as thermal conductivity and elasticity, have implications for detecting continuous gravitational waves from a rapidly rotating neutron star. In this work, we investigate the effect of the nuclear pasta on the quadruple moment, and find out that, compared with previous work, the quadrupole moment contributing to continuous gravitational-wave radiation can be up to two orders of magnitude larger. We also discuss the relationship between the quadruple moment and the maximum shear strain. Considering the properties of nuclear pasta, we study the detectability of known accreting neutron stars and compare predicted results to the detectable amplitude limits. These sources are well above the sensitivity curves for Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. Our work advances the understanding of the properties of nuclear pasta and a possible mechanism for continuous gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Superflares in HR 1099 using Temporal and Spectral Analysis of XMM-Newton Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we analyze three energetic X-ray flares from the active RS CVn binary HR 1099 using data obtained from XMM-Newton. The flare duration ranges from 2.8 to 4.1 h, with e-folding rise and decay times in the range of 27 to 38 minutes and 1.3 to 2.4 h, respectively, indicating rapid rise and slower decay phases. The flare frequency for HR 1099 is one flare per rotation period. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals peak flare temperatures of 39.44, 35.96, and 32.48 MK, emission measures of $7 \times 10^{53}$ to $8 \times 10^{54}$ cm$^{-3}$, global abundances of 0.250, 0.299, and 0.362 $Z_\odot$, and peak X-ray luminosities of $ 10^{31.21-32.29}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The quiescent state is modeled with a three-temperature plasma maintained at 3.02, 6.96, and 12.53 MK. Elemental abundances during quiescent and flaring states exhibit the inverse-FIP effect. We have conducted a comparative analysis of coronal abundances with previous studies and found evidence supporting the i-FIP effect. The derived flare semi-loop lengths of 6 to 8.9 $\times 10^{10}$ cm were found to be comparable to the other flares detected on HR 1099; however, they are significantly larger than typical solar flare loops. The estimated flare energies, ranging from $10^{35.83-37.03}$ erg, classify these flares as super-flares. The magnetic field strengths of the loops are found to be in the range of 350 to 450 G. We diagnose the physical conditions of the flaring corona in HR 1099 through the observations of superflares and provide inference on the plasma processes.</description>

      <title>Kepler frequency and moment of inertia of rotating neutron stars with chaotic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating neutron stars (NSs) are crucial objects of study, as our understanding of them relies significantly on observational data from these rotating stars. Observations suggest that the magnetic fields of NSs range from approximately $10^{8-15}$ G. In this work, we compute the Kepler frequency and moment of inertia for rotating NSs under the influence of a chaotic magnetic field. We utilize an equation of state (EOS) incorporating nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core, with the Hartle-Thorne formalism applied to address the rotational aspects. A magnetic field ansatz is selected, in which the magnetic field is coupled to the energy density. To examine the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the Kepler frequency and moment of inertia, we vary the magnetic field strength. Our results indicate that an increase in magnetic field strength enhances the Kepler frequency of rotating NSs. For the moment of inertia, the effect of magnetic field variation is minimal at lower masses but becomes more pronounced as the mass exceeds $M=0.5 M_\odot$, where moment of inertia increases with increasing magnetic field. Furthermore, our results for the moment of inertia comply with constraint derived from pulsar mass measurements, data from gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425, and X-ray observations of emission from hotspots on NS surfaces measured by NICER.</description>

      <title>Non-LTE radiative transfer simulations: Improved agreement of the double detonation with normal Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double detonation is a widely discussed explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae, whereby a helium shell detonation ignites a secondary detonation in the carbon/oxygen core of a white dwarf. Even for modern models that invoke relatively small He shell masses, many previous studies have found that the products of the helium shell detonation lead to discrepancies with normal Type Ia supernovae, such as strong Ti II absorption features, extremely red light curves and too large a variation with viewing direction. It has been suggested that non local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects may help to reduce these discrepancies with observations. Here we carry out full non-LTE radiative transfer simulations for a recent double detonation model with a relatively small helium shell mass of 0.05 M$_\odot$. We construct 1D models representative of directions in a 3D explosion model to give an indication of viewing angle dependence. The full non-LTE treatment leads to improved agreement between the models and observations. The light curves become less red, due to reduced absorption by the helium shell detonation products, since these species are more highly ionised. Additionally, the expected variation with observer direction is reduced. The full non-LTE treatment shows promising improvements, and reduces the discrepancies between the double detonation models and observations of normal Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Outflows Shaped by Ambient Pressure Gradients: a Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical deLaval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency in pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near minus two, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer in Eccentric Orbits with Self-consistent Stellar Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Roche lobe overflow mass transfer (MT) in eccentric binary systems between stars and compact objects (COs), modeling the coupled evolution of both the star and the orbit due to eccentric MT (eMT) in a self-consistent framework. We implement the analytic expressions for secular rates of change of the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity, assuming a delta function MT at periapse, into the binary stellar evolution code MESA. Two scenarios are examined: (1) a simplified model isolating the effects of eMT on stellar and orbital evolution, and (2) realistic binary configurations that include angular momentum exchange (e.g., tides, mass loss, spin-orbit coupling, and gravitational wave radiation). Unlike the ad hoc approach of instant circularization that is often employed, explicit modeling of eMT reveals a large fraction of binaries can remain eccentric post-MT. Even binaries which naturally circularize during eMT have different properties (donor mass and orbital size) compared to predictions from instant circularization, with some showing fundamentally different evolutionary outcomes (e.g., stable versus unstable MT). We demonstrate that a binary's initial mass ratio and eccentricity are predictive of whether it will remain eccentric or circularize after eMT. These findings underscore the importance of eMT in understanding CO-hosting binary populations, including X-ray binaries, gravitational wave sources, and other high-energy transients.</description>

      <title>Probing the Soft X-ray Properties and Multi-Wavelength Variability of SN2023ixf and its Progenitor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13101v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of nearly two decades of optical/UV and X-ray data to study the multi-wavelength pre-explosion properties and post-explosion X-ray properties of nearby SN2023ixf located in M101. We find no evidence of precursor activity in the optical to UV down to a luminosity of $\lesssim 7\times10^{4}\, \rm L_{\odot}$, while X-ray observations covering nearly 18 years prior to explosion show no evidence of luminous precursor X-ray emission down to an absorbed 0.3 - 10.0 keV X-ray luminosity of $\sim6\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Extensive Swift observations taken post-explosion did not detect soft X-ray emission from SN2023ixf within the first $\sim$3.3 days after first light, which suggests a mass-loss rate for the progenitor of $\lesssim5\times10^{-4}\,\rm M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ or a radius of $\lesssim4\times10^{15}$ cm for the circumstellar material. Our analysis also suggests that if the progenitor underwent a mass-loss episode, this had to occur $&gt;$ 0.5 - 1.5 years prior to explosion, consistent with previous estimates. Swift detected soft X-rays from SN2023ixf $\sim4.25$ days after first light, and it rose to a peak luminosity of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after 10 days and has maintained this luminosity for nearly 50 days post first light. This peak luminosity is lower than expected, given the evidence that SN2023ixf is interacting with dense material. However, this might be a natural consequence of an asymmetric circumstellar medium. X-ray spectra derived from merging all Swift observations over the first 50 days are best described by a two-component bremsstrahlung model consisting of a heavily absorbed and hotter component similar to that found using NuSTAR, and a less-absorbed, cooler component. We suggest that this soft component arises from cooling of the forward shock similar to that found in Type IIn SN2010jl.</description>

Abstract: A model of a conducting cylinder with a radial temperature gradient which creates an electric field that increases with time in the surrounding vacuum is examined. The conditions under which this model functions are pointed out. An electric field is also generated when a magnetic field exists along the axis of the cylinder. This article discusses the interactions of the thermal flux, magnetic field, and charge distribution. Four models are considered with different conditions for the supply of electrons from a central source and the possibility either of capturing electrons inside the cylinder or their freely leaving it through the outer boundary.</description>

      <title>Long Plateau Doth So: How Internal Heating Sources Affect Hydrogen-Rich Supernova Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernovae (type IIP SNe) exhibit evidence for a sustained energy source powering their light curves, resulting in a brighter and/or longer-lasting hydrogen-recombination plateau phase. We present a semi-analytic SNIIP light curve model that accounts for the effects of an arbitrary internal heating source, considering as special cases $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co decay, a central engine (millisecond magnetar or accreting compact object), and shock interaction with a dense circumstellar disk. While a sustained internal power source can boost the plateau luminosity commensurate with the magnitude of the power, the duration of the recombination plateau can typically be increased by at most a factor $\sim 2-3$ compared to the zero-heating case. For a given ejecta mass and initial kinetic energy, the longest plateau duration is achieved for a constant heating rate at the highest magnitude that does not appreciably accelerate the ejecta. This finding has implications for the minimum ejecta mass required to explain particularly long-lasting supernovae such as iPTF14hls, and for confidently identifying rare explosions of the most-massive hydrogen-rich (e.g. population III) stars. We present a number of analytic estimates which elucidate the key features of the detailed model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the spectral and timing study of the bright NS-LMXB GX 5-1 using \textit{\textit{AstroSat}/LAXPC} and \textit{SXT} observations conducted in the year 2018. During the observation, the source traces out the complete HB and NB of the Z-track in the HID. Understanding the spectral and temporal evolution of the source along the 'Z' track can probe the accretion process in the vicinity of a neutron star. Spectral analysis was performed in the 0.7-20 keV energy range for different segments in the HID using a multi-temperature disc black body with an average temperature, $kT_{in} \sim$0.46 and a thermal Comptonization model. It is found that the optical depth of the corona drops from $\sim$6.68 in HB to $\sim$2.74 in NB. The Timing analysis using the LAXPC instrument indicates the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations in HB, NB, and the hard apex of the Z-track. The observed QPO frequencies are similar to the characteristic frequencies of horizontal branch and normal branch oscillations. The HBO frequency increase from $\sim$12-46 Hz towards the hard apex. The timing studies conducted in soft and hard band indicate the association of HBO and NBO origin with the non-thermal component. Further research could explore the implications of this relationship for understanding the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EXO 0748-676 is a well-studied, high-inclination, dipping, and eclipsing neutron star low-mass X-ray binary that has recently emerged from 16 years of quiescence into a new outburst. We present results from a 55.5 ks of XMM-Newton observation, focusing on high-resolution spectroscopy with the same instrument (Reflection Grating Spectrometer) that produced significant insights during the previous outburst. The XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Camera light curve reveals a type I X-ray burst which leads to a corresponding optical burst by three seconds. To understand the effects of the burst on the ionization structure, the data are divided into burstless, pre-, and post-burst spectra, with additional analysis for dip and non-dip phases. The primary spectral feature in all phases is a broad O VII recombination line, accompanied by velocity-broadened O VIII, N VII, and Ne IX lines. Notably, the Ne IX line shows different ionization states for pre-burst (11.65 A) and post-burst (13.56 A) phases, while the dips also substantially affect spectral lines. The current outburst mirrors many traits from the earlier one, such as a similar spectral state, plasma components with similar ionization structures, and spectral features from the same elements, implying a stable long-term accretion behavior across outbursts.</description>

      <title>Binary Stars Approaching Supermassive Black Holes: Tidal Break-up, Double Stellar Disruptions and Stellar Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In galactic centers, stars and binaries can be injected into low-angular-momentum orbits, resulting in close encounters with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Previous works have shown that under different conditions, such close encounters can lead to the break-up of the binary, disruptions of both stars and collision between the stars. We use 3-body scattering experiments to characterize these different outcomes for a range of system parameters, such as $\beta_b$, the ratio of binary tidal radius to pericenter distance $r_p$ to the SMBH and the compactness of the binary. We focus on stellar collisions, which occur for a range of $\beta_b$'s, with a few to 10's percent probabilities (depending on the compactness of the binary). In gentle encounters ($\beta_b\lesssim 1$), stellar collisions occur after the pericenter passage, and the merger remnants are typically ejected from the SMBH at a small velocity. In deep encounters ($\beta_b\gtrsim 1$), collisions occur near the pericenter, with the impact velocity a few times the escape velocity of the star, and the merger remnants are typically bound to the SMBH. We suggest that stellar collisions induced by binary-SMBH encounters may produce exotic stars in galactic centers, trigger accretion flares onto the SMBH due to the mass loss, and result in bound merger remnants causing repeated partial TDEs.</description>

Abstract: We perform a matched asymptotic expansion to find an analytic formula for the trajectory of a light ray in a Schwarzschild metric, in a power series expansion in the deviation of the impact parameter from its critical value. We present results valid to second sub leading order in this expansion. We use these results to find an analytic expansion for the angular location of the $n^{th}$ Einstein Ring (at large $n$) resulting from a star that lies directly behind a black hole but not necessarily far from it. The small parameter for this expansion is $e^{-\pi (2n+1)}$: our formulae are accurate to third order in this parameter.</description>

      <title>Rescuing The Primordial Black Holes all-Dark Matter Hypothesis from The Fast Radio Bursts Tension</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) as an all-dark matter (DM) hypothesis has recently been demotivated by the prediction that these objects would source an excessive rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, these predictions were based on several simplifying assumptions to which this rate is highly sensitive. In this article, we improve previous estimates of this rate arising from the capture of PBHs by neutron stars (NSs), aiming to revitalise this theory. We more accurately compute the velocity distribution functions of PBHs and NSs and also consider an enhancement in the NS and DM density profiles at galactic centers due to the presence of a central supermassive black hole. We find that previous estimates of the rate of FRBs sourced by the capture of PBHs by NSs were 3 orders of magnitude too large, concluding that the PBHs as all DM hypothesis remains a viable theory and that the observed FRB rate can only be entirely explained when considering a central, sufficiently spiky PBH density profile.</description>

      <title>Migration of Accreting Planets and Black Holes in Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in the disks of active galactic nuclei. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure, and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, for the two planet masses we investigated with our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ($\Delta\dot M$ and $\Delta\dot J$) at the planet's location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength properties of three new radio-powerful $z\sim5.6$ quasi-stellar objects discovered from RACS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of three new $z\sim5.6$ quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) identified from dedicated spectroscopic observations. The three sources were selected as high-$z$ candidates based on their radio and optical/near-infrared properties as reported in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) survey. These are among the most radio-bright QSOs currently known at $z&gt;5.5$, relative to their optical luminosity, having $\rm R=S_{\rm 5GHz}/S_{\rm 4400A}&gt;100$. In this work, we present their identification, and we also discuss their multi-wavelength properties (from the radio to the X-ray band) based on detections in public surveys as well as in dedicated radio and X-ray observations. The three sources present a wide range of properties in terms of relative intensity and spectral shape, highlighting the importance of multi-wavelength observations in accurately characterising these high-$z$ objects. In particular, from our analysis we found one source at $z=5.61$ that presents clear blazar properties (strong radio and X-ray emission), making it one of the most distant currently known in this class. Moreover, from the fit of the optical/near-infrared photometric measurements with an accretion disc model as well as the analysis of the CIV broad emission line in one case, we were able to estimate the mass and accretion rate of the central black holes in these systems, finding $\rm M_{\rm BH}\sim1-10\times10^9$~M$_\odot$ accreting at a rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1-0.4$. The multi-wavelength characterisation of radio QSOs at $z&gt;5.5$, such as the ones reported here, is essential to constraining the evolution of relativistic jets and supermassive black holes hosted in this class of objects.</description>

      <title>Translating current ALP photon coupling strength bounds to the Randall-Sundrum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least $m_{a} \gtrsim 0.1$ [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.</description>
