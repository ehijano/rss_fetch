      <title>Optimal Platform Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search and matching increasingly takes place on online platforms. These platforms have elements of centralized and decentralized matching; platforms can alter the search process for its users, but are unable to eliminate search frictions entirely. I study a model where platforms can change the distribution of potential partners that an agent searches over and characterize search equilibria on platforms. When agents possess private information about their match characteristics and the platform designer acts as a profit maximizing monopolist, I characterize the optimal platform. If match characteristics are complementary and utility is transferable, I show that the only possible source of inefficiency in the optimal platform is exclusion, unlike standard non-linear pricing problems. That is, the optimal platform is efficient conditional on inclusion. Matching on the optimal platform is perfectly assortative -- there is no equilibrium mismatch.</description>

      <title>Communication with Multiple Senders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a cheap talk model with one receiver and multiple senders. Each sender observes a noisy signal regarding an unknown state of the world. Existing literature (e.g., Levit and Malenko, 2011; Battaglini, 2017) focuses on scenarios where the receiver and senders have aligned preferences in each state. We further explore situations with disagreement states where the receiver and the senders have misaligned preferences. We first show that, when the number of senders grows large, each sender's message must convey almost no information to the receiver. Furthermore, we identify a discontinuity in information transmission: with moderate conflict between the receiver and the senders, introducing an arbitrarily small probability of disagreement states causes complete unraveling, contrary to complete information transmission predicted by the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that the receiver cannot fully learn the state even when receiving messages from arbitrarily many senders.</description>

      <title>Limits of Disclosure in Search Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines competitive information disclosure in search markets with a mix of savvy consumers, who search costlessly, and inexperienced consumers, who face positive search costs. Savvy consumers incentivize truthful disclosure; inexperienced consumers, concealment. With both types, equilibrium features partial disclosure, which persists despite intense competition: in large markets, firms always conceal low valuations. Inexperienced consumers may search actively, but only in small markets. While savvy consumers benefit from increased competition, inexperienced consumers may be harmed. Changes in search costs have non-monotone effects: when costs are low, sufficient reductions increase informativeness and welfare; when costs are high, the opposite.</description>

      <title>The (Mis)use of Information in Decentralised Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A seller offers an asset in a decentralised market. Buyers have private signals about their common value. I study whether the market becomes allocatively more efficient with (i) more buyers, (ii) better-informed buyers. Both increase the information available about buyers' common value, but also the adverse selection each buyer faces. With more buyers, trade surplus eventually increases and converges to the full-information upper bound if and only if the likelihood ratios of buyers' signals are unbounded from above. Otherwise, it eventually decreases and converges to the no-information lower bound. With better information about trades buyers would have accepted, trade surplus increases. With better information about trades they would have rejected, trade surplus decreases--unless adverse selection is irrelevant. For binary signals, a sharper characterisation emerges: stronger good news increase total surplus, but stronger bad news eventually decrease it.</description>

      <title>Realigning Incentives to Build Better Software: a Holistic Approach to Vendor Accountability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we ask the question of why the quality of commercial software, in terms of security and safety, does not measure up to that of other (durable) consumer goods we have come to expect. We examine this question through the lens of incentives. We argue that the challenge around better quality software is due in no small part to a sequence of misaligned incentives, the most critical of which being that the harm caused by software problems is by and large shouldered by consumers, not developers. This lack of liability means software vendors have every incentive to rush low-quality software onto the market and no incentive to enhance quality control. Within this context, this paper outlines a holistic technical and policy framework we believe is needed to incentivize better and more secure software development. At the heart of the incentive realignment is the concept of software liability. This framework touches on various components, including legal, technical, and financial, that are needed for software liability to work in practice; some currently exist, some will need to be re-imagined or established. This is primarily a market-driven approach that emphasizes voluntary participation but highlights the role appropriate regulation can play. We connect and contrast this with the EU legal environment and discuss what this framework means for open-source software (OSS) development and emerging AI risks. Moreover, we present a CrowdStrike case study complete with a what-if analysis had our proposed framework been in effect. Our intention is very much to stimulate a robust conversation among both researchers and practitioners.</description>
