      <title>Identification and inference of outcome conditioned partial effects of general interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new class of distributional causal quantities, referred to as the \textit{outcome conditioned partial policy effects} (OCPPEs), to measure the \textit{average} effect of a general counterfactual intervention of a target covariate on the individuals in different quantile ranges of the outcome distribution.
  The OCPPE approach is valuable in several aspects: (i) Unlike the unconditional quantile partial effect (UQPE) that is not $\sqrt{n}$-estimable, an OCPPE is $\sqrt{n}$-estimable. Analysts can use it to capture heterogeneity across the unconditional distribution of $Y$ as well as obtain accurate estimation of the aggregated effect at the upper and lower tails of $Y$. (ii) The semiparametric efficiency bound for an OCPPE is explicitly derived. (iii) We propose an efficient debiased estimator for OCPPE, and provide feasible uniform inference procedures for the OCPPE process. (iv) The efficient doubly robust score for an OCPPE can be used to optimize infinitesimal nudges to a continuous treatment by maximizing a quantile specific Empirical Welfare function. We illustrate the method by analyzing how anti-smoking policies impact low percentiles of live infants' birthweights.</description>

      <title>Causal modelling without counterfactuals and individualised effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most common approach to causal modelling is the potential outcomes framework due to Neyman and Rubin. In this framework, outcomes of counterfactual treatments are assumed to be well-defined. This metaphysical assumption is often thought to be problematic yet indispensable. The conventional approach relies not only on counterfactuals, but also on abstract notions of distributions and assumptions of independence that are not directly testable. In this paper, we construe causal inference as treatment-wise predictions for finite populations where all assumptions are testable; this means that one can not only test predictions themselves (without any fundamental problem), but also investigate sources of error when they fail. The new framework highlights the model-dependence of causal claims as well as the difference between statistical and scientific inference.</description>

      <title>Binscatter Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.09615v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the package Binsreg, which implements the binscatter methods developed by Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell, and Feng (2024b,a). The package includes seven commands: binsreg, binslogit, binsprobit, binsqreg, binstest, binspwc, and binsregselect. The first four commands implement binscatter plotting, point estimation, and uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals and confidence bands) for least squares linear binscatter regression (binsreg) and for nonlinear binscatter regression (binslogit for Logit regression, binsprobit for Probit regression, and binsqreg for quantile regression). The next two commands focus on pointwise and uniform inference: binstest implements hypothesis testing procedures for parametric specifications and for nonparametric shape restrictions of the unknown regression function, while binspwc implements multi-group pairwise statistical comparisons. Finally, the command binsregselect implements data-driven number of bins selectors. The commands offer binned scatter plots, and allow for covariate adjustment, weighting, clustering, and multi-sample analysis, which is useful when studying treatment effect heterogeneity in randomized and observational studies, among many other features.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bias-Correction and Valid Inference in High-Dimensional Ridge Regression: A Closed-Form Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ridge regression is an indispensable tool in big data analysis. Yet its inherent bias poses a significant and longstanding challenge, compromising both statistical efficiency and scalability across various applications. To tackle this critical issue, we introduce an iterative strategy to correct bias effectively when the dimension $p$ is less than the sample size $n$. For $p&gt;n$, our method optimally mitigates the bias such that any remaining bias in the proposed de-biased estimator is unattainable through linear transformations of the response data. To address the remaining bias when $p&gt;n$, we employ a Ridge-Screening (RS) method, producing a reduced model suitable for bias correction. Crucially, under certain conditions, the true model is nested within our selected one, highlighting RS as a novel variable selection approach. Through rigorous analysis, we establish the asymptotic properties and valid inferences of our de-biased ridge estimators for both $p&lt;n$ and $p&gt;n$, where, both $p$ and $n$ may increase towards infinity, along with the number of iterations. We further validate these results using simulated and real-world data examples. Our method offers a transformative solution to the bias challenge in ridge regression inferences across various disciplines.</description>
