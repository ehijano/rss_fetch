      <title>Three Dimensional Effects on Proton Acceleration with Grooved Hydrocarbon Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, it has been demonstrated that in laser based proton acceleration with micro-structured targets, a single rectangular groove on the target front offers significant proton cut-off enhancement with linearly polarised laser pulses. In the present work, three-dimensional investigations are carried out to identify notable differences between cylindrical and cuboidal groove geometries both of which correspond to a rectangular groove in a two-dimensional case. In particular, a waveguide model is employed to analyse the effect of the groove geometry and extensive three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are performed to demonstrate the distinct behaviour of laser pulse and electrons for cylindrical and cuboidal grooves. Further, the effect of a circular polarisation of the incident laser pulse on the spectra of accelerated protons is studied. It is shown that contrary to our initial expectations, cylindrical symmetry and circular polarisation do not play well together and cause as much as 15$\%$ decay in proton cut-off energies as compared to the case of cylindrical symmetry and linear polarisation.</description>

      <title>Ion Temperature Anisotropy Limits from Magnetic Curvature Scattering in Magnetotail Reconnection Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collisionless plasmas, relaxation of the deviations of ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) occurs through particle interactions with electromagnetic fields. In particular, in the Earth's magnetotail, the deviations of the ion VDFs, typically consisting of multiple components, from the equilibrium must be limited to maintain stability of the current sheet. Curvature scattering is a leading candidate mechanism to limit such deviations, but its role remains insufficiently understood. We investigate the limits of ion temperature anisotropy in a magnetotail-like configuration by modeling a quasi-1D current sheet with a finite magnetic field curvature and three ion populations. We derive analytical thresholds for anisotropy based on current sheet stability and validate against spacecraft observations and numerical results. Our findings demonstrate that curvature scattering imposes limits on ion anisotropies, thereby maintaining the stability of the current sheet.</description>

      <title>Bell Plesset Effects on Rayleigh Taylor Instability of Three Dimensional Spherical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a weakly nonlinear, multi-mode theory for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) on a time-varying spherical interface, fully incorporating mode couplings and the Bell-Plesset (BP) effects arising from interface convergence. Our model extends prior analyses, which have been largely restricted to static backgrounds, 2D cylindrical geometries, or single-mode initial conditions. We present a framework capable of evolving arbitrary, fully three-dimensional initial perturbations on a dynamic background. At the first order, mode amplitudes respond to the time-varying interface acceleration with an exponential-like growth, in qualitative agreement with classic static results. At second order, nonlinear mode coupling reveals a powerful selection rule: energy is preferentially channeled into axisymmetric (m=0) modes. We find that the BP effects dramatically amplify the instability growth by a few orders of magnitude, with this amplification being even more significant for second order couplings. Despite this strong channeling, the second order amplitudes remain small relative to the first order, validating the perturbative approach. These findings offer new physical insights into time-dependent interface instabilities relevant to applications such as astrophysical shell collapse and inertial confinement fusion, highlighting the uniquely dominant role of axisymmetric modes in BP-driven convergent flows.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Operator Learning for Nonlinear Grad-Shafranov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.</description>

      <title>Abnormal Polarity Effect on the DC Breakdown Voltage in Short SF6 Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, through the comparison between experiment and numerical simulation, we reveal the dynamic mechanism underlying the abnormal polarity effect in SF6 short-gap DC breakdown, as well as a novel criterion for predicting negative breakdown voltage. Using the traditional single-streamer breakdown criterion, the simulated positive breakdown voltage agrees well with experimental measurements, whereas the simulated negative breakdown voltage deviates markedly from the experiments, so the single-streamer breakdown criterion fails to reproduce the abnormal polarity effect observed experimentally. In addressing this, we propose an ion-ion plasma breakdown criterion for negative breakdown voltage. When this novel criterion is applied, the simulated negative breakdown voltage agrees with the experiments and reflects the abnormal polarity effect. Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of key physical parameters reveals that, the dynamic mechanism for ion-ion plasma breakdown for negative polarity can be divided into four stages: primary streamer stage, ion accumulation stage, reconstructive ionization stage, and ion-ion plasma propagation stage. Notably, the ion-ion plasma propagation stage is dominated by photoionization-driven negative-ion accumulation rather than conventional impact ionization.</description>

      <title>Two-Stream Instability and Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Mode Formation in Coulomb One Component Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Two-Stream Instability in a strongly coupled plasma using classical molecular dynamics simulations with long-range Coulomb interactions between particles. The nonlinear evolution of the instability is identified by the emergence of a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) mode. Our simulations capture key microscopic effects, such as inter-particle correlations, collisional dynamics, and coherent wave-particle interactions-features often absent in traditional fluid and kinetic models, including Particle-In-Cell and Vlasov approaches. In the linear regime, the instability grows rapidly and saturates within a few tens of plasma periods. As the system transitions into the nonlinear saturation phase, a single BGK mode emerges. This mode (or phase-space hole) becomes dynamically unstable in the nonlinear regime, characterized by a continuous decay of electrostatic energy over time. An energy budget analysis reveals a bump in an otherwise thermal spectrum, indicating the excitation of a coherent mode, further confirmed through a numerical rendering of the dispersion relation. The pairwise interaction plays a crucial role: pronounced instability and BGK mode formation occur with long-range Coulomb forces, while such structures are suppressed under shielded Coulomb interactions. We observe the emergence of a single BGK mode across all coupling strengths in the fluid regime, provided the streaming velocity exceeds a critical threshold.</description>

      <title>Entity -- Hardware-agnostic Particle-in-Cell Code for Plasma Astrophysics. I: Curvilinear Special Relativistic Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity is a new-generation, fully open-source particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed to overcome key limitations in astrophysical plasma modeling, particularly the extreme separation of scales and the performance challenges associated with evolving, GPU-centric computing infrastructures. It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.</description>

      <title>Formulation and verification of multiscale gyrokinetic simulation of kinetic-MHD processes in toroidal plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive gyrokinetic simulation model has been implemented in the global toroidal gyrokinetic code (GTC) and verified for studying low-frequency waves and turbulence in magnetic fusion plasmas by treating all kinetic-MHD processes on an equal footing. A theoretical framework has been formulated to unify various methods for efficiently solving the electron drift kinetic equation in multiscale simulations by separating electron responses into analytic and non-analytic parts based on the smallness parameter of electron-to-ion mass ratio. The model can be reduced to the ideal MHD model with both the linear dispersion relation and the nonlinear ponderomotive force in theory and simulation. The model is used for the verification and validation of simulating internal kink modes in the DIII-D tokamak with accurate calculations of equilibrium parallel current and compressible magnetic perturbation. A large simulation database has been generated to train a surrogate model to predict the kink instability. Statistical analysis shows that the radial location of safety factor q=1 flux-surface and the plasma beta inside the q=1 surface are the most important parameters for predicting the kink instability.</description>

      <title>Application of the Portable Diagnostic Package to the Wisconsin High-temperature-superconducting Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an application of the Portable Diagnostic Package (PDP) on the Wisconsin HTS Axisymmetric Mirror (WHAM), which integrates an optical emission spectroscopy (OES) system and an active Thomson scattering (TS) system. Due to the designed portability of our system, we realized the installation of the PDP OES and TS measurements on WHAM in $\sim$6 months. The OES system facilitates a comprehensive impurity line survey and enables flow measurements through the Doppler effect observed on impurity lines. Notably, plasma rotation profiles were successfully derived from doubly charged carbon lines. In addition, the TS system enabled the first measurements of the electron temperature in commissioning plasmas on WHAM. These successes underscore the diagnostic package's potential for advancing experimental plasma studies.</description>

      <title>Transition to Petschek Reconnection in Subrelativistic Pair Plasmas: Implications for Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\sigma \gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\sigma &lt; 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Cosmic Ray Transport in strong MHD Turbulence due to Magnetic Mirroring and Resonant Curvature Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test-particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with $\delta B/B_0\sim 1$ and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch-angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch-angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a L\'evy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch-angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories that fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic-ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Production of High-Specific-Activity Radioisotopes Using High-Energy Fusion Neutrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that transmutation driven by high-energy neutrons from deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion reactions can produce many important medical radioisotopes - including $^{32}$P, $^{60}$Co, $^{64}$Cu, $^{89}$Sr, $^{90}$Y, $^{89}$Zr, $^{99}$Mo/$^{99\mathrm{m}}$Tc, $^{103}$Pd, $^{111}$In, $^{117}$In/$^{117\mathrm{m}1}$Sn, $^{123}$I, $^{125}$I, $^{131}$I, $^{133}$Xe, $^{153}$Sm, $^{166}$Ho, $^{177}$Lu, $^{188}$Re, and $^{192}$Ir-and emerging isotopes such as $^{47}$Sc, $^{67}$Cu, $^{103}$Ru/$^{103\mathrm{m}}$Rh, $^{103}$Pd/$^{103\mathrm{m}}$Rh, $^{119}$Sb, $^{124}$I, $^{155}$Tb, $^{161}$Tb, $^{195\mathrm{m}1}$Ir/$^{195\mathrm{m}}$Pt, and $^{225}$Ac with high specific activity and in large quantities. These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical separation of the product. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.</description>
