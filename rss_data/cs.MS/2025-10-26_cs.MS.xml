      <title>Pty-Chi: A PyTorch-based modern ptychographic data analysis package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography has become an indispensable tool for high-resolution, non-destructive imaging using coherent light sources. The processing of ptychographic data critically depends on robust, efficient, and flexible computational reconstruction software. We introduce Pty-Chi, an open-source ptychographic reconstruction package built on PyTorch that unifies state-of-the-art analytical algorithms with automatic differentiation methods. Pty-Chi provides a comprehensive suite of reconstruction algorithms while supporting advanced experimental parameter corrections such as orthogonal probe relaxation and multislice modeling. Leveraging PyTorch as the computational backend ensures vendor-agnostic GPU acceleration, multi-device parallelization, and seamless access to modern optimizers. An object-oriented, modular design makes Pty-Chi highly extendable, enabling researchers to prototype new imaging models, integrate machine learning approaches, or build entirely new workflows on top of its core components. We demonstrate Pty-Chi's capabilities through challenging case studies that involve limited coherence, low overlap, and unstable illumination during scanning, which highlight its accuracy, versatility, and extensibility. With community-driven development and open contribution, Pty-Chi offers a modern, maintainable platform for advancing computational ptychography and for enabling innovative imaging algorithms at synchrotron facilities and beyond.</description>

      <title>Factor Fitting, Rank Allocation, and Partitioning in Multilevel Low Rank Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider multilevel low rank (MLR) matrices, defined as a row and column permutation of a sum of matrices, each one a block diagonal refinement of the previous one, with all blocks low rank given in factored form. MLR matrices extend low rank matrices but share many of their properties, such as the total storage required and complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We address three problems that arise in fitting a given matrix by an MLR matrix in the Frobenius norm. The first problem is factor fitting, where we adjust the factors of the MLR matrix. The second is rank allocation, where we choose the ranks of the blocks in each level, subject to the total rank having a given value, which preserves the total storage needed for the MLR matrix. The final problem is to choose the hierarchical partition of rows and columns, along with the ranks and factors. This paper is accompanied by an open source package that implements the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>MAGNET: an open-source library for mesh agglomeration by Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MAGNET, an open-source Python library designed for mesh agglomeration in both two- and three-dimensions, based on employing Graph Neural Networks (GNN). MAGNET serves as a comprehensive solution for training a variety of GNN models, integrating deep learning and other advanced algorithms such as METIS and k-means to facilitate mesh agglomeration and quality metric computation. The library's introduction is outlined through its code structure and primary features. The GNN framework adopts a graph bisection methodology that capitalizes on connectivity and geometric mesh information via SAGE convolutional layers, in line with the methodology proposed by Antonietti et al. (2024). Additionally, the proposed MAGNET library incorporates reinforcement learning to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the model for predicting coarse partitions within a multilevel framework. A detailed tutorial is provided to guide the user through the process of mesh agglomeration and the training of a GNN bisection model. We present several examples of mesh agglomeration conducted by MAGNET, demonstrating the library's applicability across various scenarios. Furthermore, the performance of the newly introduced models is contrasted with that of METIS and k-means, illustrating that the proposed GNN models are competitive regarding partition quality and computational efficiency. Finally, we exhibit the versatility of MAGNET's interface through its integration with Lymph, an open-source library implementing discontinuous Galerkin methods on polytopal grids for the numerical discretization of multiphysics differential problems.</description>
