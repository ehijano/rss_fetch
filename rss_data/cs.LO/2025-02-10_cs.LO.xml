      <title>Infinite State Model Checking by Learning Transitive Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for proving safety of infinite state systems. It extends the analyzed system by transitive relations until its diameter D becomes finite, i.e., until constantly many steps suffice to cover all reachable states, irrespective of the initial state. Then we can prove safety by checking that no error state is reachable in D steps. To deduce transitive relations, we use recurrence analysis. While recurrence analyses can usually find conjunctive relations only, our approach also discovers disjunctive relations by combining recurrence analysis with projections. An empirical evaluation of the implementation of our approach in our tool LoAT shows that it is highly competitive with the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Solvability of Approximate Reach-Avoid Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: In a companion paper, we propose a parametric hybrid automaton model and an algorithm for the online synthesis of robustly correct and near-optimal controllers for cyber-physical system with reach-avoid guarantees. A key part of this synthesis problem is based on a weighted discretised game and solved via scope-adaptive discrete dynamic programming. Approach: This work examines proofs of key properties of the discussed algorithm. Evaluation: The main proof is by induction over the stages of a discrete Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system of equations. Contribution: The results include a game solvability theorem and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for its applicability.</description>

      <title>Completeness Theorems for k-SUM and Geometric Friends: Deciding Fragments of Integer Linear Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last three decades, the $k$-SUM hypothesis has emerged as a satisfying explanation of long-standing time barriers for a variety of algorithmic problems. Yet to this day, the literature knows of only few proven consequences of a refutation of this hypothesis. Taking a descriptive complexity viewpoint, we ask: What is the largest logically defined class of problems \emph{captured} by the $k$-SUM problem?
  To this end, we introduce a class $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ of problems corresponding to deciding sentences in Presburger arithmetic/linear integer arithmetic over finite subsets of integers.
  We establish two large fragments for which the $k$-SUM problem is complete under fine-grained reductions:
  1. The $k$-SUM problem is complete for deciding the sentences with $k$ existential quantifiers.
  2. The $3$-SUM problem is complete for all $3$-quantifier sentences of $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ expressible using at most $3$ linear inequalities.
  Specifically, a faster-than-$n^{\lceil k/2 \rceil \pm o(1)}$ algorithm for $k$-SUM (or faster-than-$n^{2 \pm o(1)}$ algorithm for $3$-SUM, respectively) directly translate to polynomial speedups of a general algorithm for \emph{all} sentences in the respective fragment.
  Observing a barrier for proving completeness of $3$-SUM for the entire class $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$, we turn to the question which other -- seemingly more general -- problems are complete for $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$. In this direction, we establish $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$-completeness of the \emph{problem pair} of Pareto Sum Verification and Hausdorff Distance under $n$ Translations under the $L_\infty$/$L_1$ norm in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. In particular, our results invite to investigate Pareto Sum Verification as a high-dimensional generalization of 3-SUM.</description>

      <title>${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$: Multilingual Proof Data Synthesis and Theorem-Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown substantial promise at automatic theorem-proving in interactive proof assistants (ITPs) like Lean and Coq. However, most neural theorem-proving models are restricted to specific ITPs, leaving out opportunities for cross-lingual $\textit{transfer}$ between ITPs. We address this weakness with a multilingual proof framework, ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$, that allows a standardized form of interaction between neural theorem-provers and two established ITPs (Coq and Lean). It enables the collection of multilingual proof step data -- data recording the result of proof actions on ITP states -- for training neural provers. ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$ allows the systematic evaluation of a model's performance across different ITPs and problem domains via efficient parallel proof search algorithms. We show that multilingual training enabled by ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$ can lead to successful transfer across ITPs. Specifically, a model trained on a mix of ${\rm P{\small ROOF}W{\small ALA}}$-generated Coq and Lean data outperforms Lean-only and Coq-only models on the standard prove-at-$k$ metric. We open source all code including code for the $\href{https://github.com/trishullab/proof-wala}{ProofWala\; Framework}$, and the $\href{https://github.com/trishullab/itp-interface}{Multilingual\; ITP\; interaction\; framework}$.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Formal Proof-Generating Models with ChatGPT and Basic Searching Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge of formal proof generation has a rich history, but with modern techniques, we may finally be at the stage of making actual progress in real-life mathematical problems. This paper explores the integration of ChatGPT and basic searching techniques to simplify generating formal proofs, with a particular focus on the miniF2F dataset. We demonstrate how combining a large language model like ChatGPT with a formal language such as Lean, which has the added advantage of being verifiable, enhances the efficiency and accessibility of formal proof generation. Despite its simplicity, our best-performing Lean-based model surpasses all known benchmarks with a 31.15% pass rate. We extend our experiments to include other datasets and employ alternative language models, showcasing our models' comparable performance in diverse settings and allowing for a more nuanced analysis of our results. Our findings offer insights into AI-assisted formal proof generation, suggesting a promising direction for future research in formal mathematical proof.</description>

      <title>Sea-cret Agents: Maritime Abduction for Region Generation to Expose Dark Vessel Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bad actors in the maritime industry engage in illegal behaviors after disabling their vessel's automatic identification system (AIS) - which makes finding such vessels difficult for analysts. Machine learning approaches only succeed in identifying the locations of these ``dark vessels'' in the immediate future. This work leverages ideas from the literature on abductive inference applied to locating adversarial agents to solve the problem. Specifically, we combine concepts from abduction, logic programming, and rule learning to create an efficient method that approaches full recall of dark vessels while requiring less search area than machine learning methods. We provide a logic-based paradigm for reasoning about maritime vessels, an abductive inference query method, an automatically extracted rule-based behavior model methodology, and a thorough suite of experiments.</description>
