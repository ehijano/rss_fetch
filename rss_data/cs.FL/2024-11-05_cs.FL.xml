      <title>Decidability Issues for Petri Nets -- a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey 25 years of research on decidability issues for Petri nets. We collect results on the decidability of important properties, equivalence notions, and temporal logics.</description>

      <title>Reachability in One-Dimensional Pushdown Vector Addition Systems is Decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the model of one-dimensional Pushdown Vector Addition Systems (1-PVAS), a fundamental computational model simulating both recursive and concurrent behaviours. Our main result is decidability of the reachability problem for 1-PVAS, an important open problem investigated for at least a decade. In the algorithm we actually consider an equivalent model of Grammar Vector Addition Systems (GVAS). We prove the main result by showing that for every one-dimensional GVAS (1-GVAS) one can compute another 1-GVAS, which has the same reachability relation as the original one and additionally has the so-called thin property. Due to the work of Atig and Ganty from 2011, thin 1-GVAS have decidable reachability problem, therefore our construction implies decidability of the problem for all 1-GVAS. Moreover, we also show that if reachability in thin 1-GVAS can be decided in elementary time then also reachability in all 1-GVAS can be decided in elementary time.</description>

      <title>Restivo Salemi property for $\alpha$-power free languages with $\alpha\geq 5$ and $k\geq 3$ letters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2009, Shur published the following conjecture: Let $L$ be a power-free language and let $e(L)\subseteq L$ be the set of words of $L$ that can be extended to a bi-infinite word respecting the given power-freeness. If $u, v \in e(L)$ then $uwv \in e(L)$ for some word $w$. Let $L_{k,\alpha}$ denote an $\alpha$-power free language over an alphabet with $k$ letters, where $\alpha$ is a positive rational number and $k$ is positive integer. We prove the conjecture for the languages $L_{k,\alpha}$, where $\alpha\geq 5$ and $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian scaling laws for in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful technique for getting language models to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the accuracy of the model's predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This perspective gives rise to a family of novel Bayesian scaling laws for ICL. In experiments with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling laws exceed or match existing scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT to suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then experiment on real-world instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict the conditions under which ICL will cause the suppressed behavior to reemerge, which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM safety.</description>
