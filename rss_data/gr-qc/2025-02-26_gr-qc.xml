      <title>Kerr-Newman quasinormal modes and Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently suggested the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes is related to a class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theories described by Seiberg-Witten curves, a proposal that has been tested for a number of black hole spacetimes. The aim of this study is to clarify the key ideas of this conjecture to a non-high-energy-physics audience, and test it in a setting that has not yet been explored: the electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of Kerr-Newman black holes in the Dudley-Finley approximation. In the parameter space we explore, we find numerical evidence that the conjecture is valid for sub-extremal black holes and its slowest damped quasinormal frequencies, thereby providing further support for the conjecture's validity. In addition, we exploit the symmetries of the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory to obtain a strikingly simple isospectral version of the radial Dudley-Finley equation.</description>

      <title>$f(R)$ Gravity: Graviational Waves Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores modified theories of gravity, particularly $f(R)$ gravity, as extensions to General Relativity (GR) that offer alternatives to dark energy for explaining cosmic acceleration. These models generalize the Einstein-Hilbert action to include functions of the Ricci scalar, providing new insights into cosmology and astrophysics. The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has enabled rigorous tests of $f(R)$ gravity, as deviations in GW propagation, speed, and polarization can signal modifications to GR. Constraints on $f(R)$ models arise from LIGO-Virgo observations of binary mergers, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), and complementary tests in cosmology and weak-field regimes. Future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope, will enhance sensitivity to smaller deviations from GR, necessitating advancements in theoretical modeling. Among competing theories -- including scalar-tensor, massive gravity, and Horndeski models -- $f(R)$ gravity remains a pivotal framework for understanding fundamental gravitational physics and cosmology. This review highlights key developments, challenges, and future directions in the field.</description>

      <title>General-Relativistic Lattice-Boltzmann Method for Radiation Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first extension of the special-relativistic Lattice-Boltzmann Method for radiative transport developed by Weih et al. (2020), to solve the radiative-transfer equation in curved spacetimes. The novel approach is based on the streaming of carefully selected photons along null geodesics and interpolating their final positions, velocities, and frequency shifts to all photons in a given velocity stencil. Furthermore, by transforming between the laboratory frame, the Eulerian frame, and the fluid frame, we are able to perform the collision step in the fluid frame, thus retaining the collision operator of the special-relativistic case with only minor modifications. As a result, with the new method we can model the evolution of the frequency-independent (grey) radiation field as it interacts with a background fluid via absorption, emission, and scattering in a curved background spacetime. Finally, by introducing a refined adaptive stencil, which is suitably distorted in the direction of propagation of the photon bundle, we can reduce the computational costs of the method while improving its performance in the optically-thin regime. A number of standard and novel tests are presented to validate the approach and exhibit its robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Stress energy momentum in terms of geodesic accelerations and variational tensors including torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity and its extensions including torsion identify stress energy momentum as being proportional to the Einstein tensor, thus ensuring both symmetry and conservation. Here we visualize stress energy and momentum by identifying the associated relative fractional accelerations of geodesics encoded in the Einstein tensor. This also provides an intuitive explanation for the vanishing divergence of the Einstein tensor. In order to obtain this same energy and momentum for other actions such as that of Dirac theory including torsion, we then review the various stress energy momentum tensors resulting from the variation of different quantities derived from parallel transport, and detail their interrelationships. This provides an opportunity to revisit some classic material from a geometric point of view, including Einstein-Cartan theory, the Sciama-Kibble formalism, and the Belinfante-Rosenfeld relation, whose derivation in the mostly pluses signature would seem to not be otherwise readily available.</description>

      <title>$f(Q)$ gravitational theory and its structure via red-shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for reconstructing the $f(Q)$ gravitational theory using parameterizations of the deceleration parameter or alternative options. This method enables the development of modified gravity scenarios that align with cosmological observations. We analyze two deceleration parameter models and one effective equation of state model from the literature. By leveraging the matter density parameter's asymptotic behaviour, we further refine the viable parameter space for these models. One tested model demonstrates that even slight modifications can yield viable cosmic scenarios, where the dark energy (DE) sector becomes dynamic and is entirely described instead of using a cosmological constant, we use modified gravity. These scenarios are qualitatively distinct yet quantitatively consistent with $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Hairless Black Hole by Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplaying effects of black hole scalarization and superradiance in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model, with the scalar field possessing electric charge. Restricted to spherical symmetry, our linear analysis about a Reissner-Nordstr\"om background confirms the persistence of tachyonic scalar modes upon inclusion of electric charge. However, fully nonlinear numerical simulations reveal that the system no longer evolves into a scalarized, hairy black hole state. Instead, we find that the superradiance phenomenon (specifically the electromagnetic version of the effect) causes the scalar condensate to become fully depleted through accretion into the black hole and radiation to spatial infinity. The combination of the two effects, which we refer to as "tachyonic superradiance", may thus be seen as a particularly efficient mechanism for the extraction of energy from a black hole, exploiting both the tachyonic growth and superradiant emission. We accurately compute the amounts of energy transfer in different channels by deriving formulae for the energy fluxes of matter fields in the presence of a dynamical horizon, which are amenable for evaluation in numerical relativity calculations.</description>

      <title>Unified $\chi^2$ discriminators for gravitational wave searches from compact coalescing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) signals of astrophysical origin are typically weak. This is because gravity is a weak force, the weakest among the four forces we know of. In order to detect GW signals, one must make differential measurements of effective lengths less than a thousandth of the size of a proton. In spite of the detectors achieving extraordinary sensitivity, the detector noise typically overwhelms the signal, so that GW signals are deeply buried in the data. The challenge to the data analyst is of extracting the GW signal from the noise, that is, first deciding whether a signal is present or not then if present, measuring its parameters.
  However, in the search for coalescing compact binary (CBC) signals, short-duration non-Gaussian noise transients (glitches) in the detector data significantly affect the search sensitivity. $\chi^2$ discriminators are therefore employed to mitigate their effect. We show that the underlying mathematical structure of any $\chi^2$ is a vector bundle over the signal manifold $\mathcal{P}$, that is, the manifold traced out by the signal waveforms in the Hilbert space of data segments $\mathcal{D}$. The $\chi^2$ is then defined as the square of the $L_2$ norm of the data vector projected onto a finite-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{S}$ (fibre) of $\mathcal{D}$ chosen orthogonal to the triggered template waveform. Any such fibre leads to a $\chi^2$ discriminator and the full vector bundle comprising the subspaces $\mathcal{S}$ and the base manifold $\mathcal{P}$ contitute the discriminator. We show that this structure paves the way for constructing effective discriminators against different morphologies of glitches. Here we specifically demonstrate our method on blip glitches, which can be modelled as sine-Gausians, which then generates an optimal $\chi^2$ statistic for blip glitches.</description>

      <title>Shadow Cast by the Kerr MOG Black Hole under the Influence of Plasma and Constraints from EHT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of black hole (BH) shadows provide crucial insights into the nature of strong gravitational effects and the intricate structure of the spacetime surrounding BHs. In this paper, we explore the shadow of Kerr MOG BH within a plasma environment, investigating how much the presence of plasma influences the characteristics of the observed shadow compared to those in vacuum conditions. Our analysis reveals that the shadow characteristics of M87* and Sgr A* are more compatible with event horizon telescope (EHT) observational data in nonhomogeneous plasma spacetime compared to homogeneous distributions. For small metric deformation parameter $\alpha$, the shadow aligns within $2\sigma$ uncertainty for homogeneous plasma and within $1\sigma$ for nonhomogeneous plasma. Next, we determine the energy emission rate for the Kerr MOG BH and analyze the influence of parameters $\alpha$, $k_o$, $k_\theta$, and $k_r$ on particle emissions in the BH vicinity. We further analyze the deflection angle in the presence of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous plasma profiles. The findings indicate notable differences from the vacuum scenario, underscoring the importance of accounting for plasma effects in studying light propagation around compact objects.</description>

      <title>Towards robust gravitational wave detections from individual supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the stochastic gravitational-wave background via pulsar timing arrays will likely be followed by the detection of individual black hole binaries that stand out above the background. However, to confidently claim the detection of an individual binary, we need not only more and better data, but also more sophisticated analysis techniques. In this paper, we develop two new approaches that can help us more robustly ascertain if a candidate found by a search algorithm is indeed an individual supermassive black hole binary. One of these is a coherence test that directly compares the full signal model to an incoherent version of that. The other is a model scrambling approach that builds null distributions of our detection statistic and compares that with the measured value to quantify our confidence in signal coherence. Both of these rely on finding the coherence between pulsars characteristic to gravitational waves from a binary system. We test these methods on simple simulated datasets and find that they work well in correctly identifying both true gravitational waves and false positives. However, as expected for such a flexible and simple signal model, confidently identifying signal coherence is significantly harder than simply finding a candidate in most scenarios. Our analyses also indicate that the confidence with which we can identify a true signal depends not only on the signal-to-noise ratio, but also on the number of contributing pulsars and the amount of frequency evolution shown by the signal.</description>

      <title>Parametric solutions to the Kerr separatrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerr separatrix is a boundary in parameter space that separates bound orbits from plunging orbits in the Kerr black hole space-time. Recently, Stein and Warburton found a polynomial equation for the location of the separatrix, for two different choices of inclination parameter. Following a method of Levin and Perez-Giz developed for the equatorial case, we use a correspondence between homoclinic orbits and unstable spherical orbits to derive explicit solutions to the separatrix polynomials. These solutions are parametrised in terms of the radius of the unstable spherical orbit.</description>

      <title>Emergence of running vacuum energy in $f(R,T)$ gravity : Observational constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new analysis for $f(R,T)$ gravity by exploring the energy momentum tensor. We demonstrate that $f(R,T)$ gravity with the form $f(R,T)=R+2 \kappa^2 \lambda T-2\Lambda$ is equivalent to Running Vacuum Energy (RVE), which interacts with the components of the cosmic fluid, namely dark matter and radiation. Interestingly, the form of such interaction is inferred from the non-conservation of the stress energy tensor in $f(R, T)$ gravity rather than being introduced in a phenomenological manner. Furthermore, the parameters that distinguish RVE from $\Lambda$CDM are fixed once the parameter of $f(R,T)$ gravity, $\lambda$, is known. To illustrate our setup, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of three interaction scenarios using a combination of different data. we find that the parameters characterizing the RVE model are very small as expected. These results give an accuracy to this equivalence between $f(R,T)$ gravity under consideration and support the recent result obtained from a quantum field theory in curved space-time point of view which could open a new relationship between $f(R,T)$ gravity and quantum field theory. Finally, the interaction of the running vacuum increases the value of the current value of the Hubble rate by $3.5\%$ compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, which may be a promising study for the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: We obtain universal relations for fluid spheres without rotation made of dark energy assuming the Extended-Chaplygin Gas equation-of-state. After integrating the relevant differential equations, we make a fit to obtain the unknown coefficients of the functions a) normalized moment of inertia versus dimensionless deformability and b) normalized moment of inertia versus factor of compactness. We find that the form of the functions does not depend on the details of the underlying equation-of-state.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, Bardeen and Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

Abstract: General relativity (GR) is a highly successful theory that describes gravity as a geometric phenomenon. The gravitational redshift, a classic test of GR, can potentially be violated in alternative gravity theories, and experimental tests on this effect are crucial for our understanding of gravity. In this paper, considering the space-ground clock comparisons with free-space links, we discuss a high-precision Doppler cancellation-based measurement model for testing gravitational redshift. This model can effectively reduce various sources of error and noise, reducing the influences of the first-order Doppler effect, atmospheric delay, Shapiro delay, etc. China's Lunar Exploration Project (CLEP) is proposed to equip the deep-space H maser with a daily stability of $2\times10^{-15}$, which provides an approach for testing gravitational redshift. Based on the simulation, we analyze the space-ground clock comparison experiments of the CLEP experiment, and simulation analysis demonstrates that under ideal condition of high-precision measurement of the onboard H-maser frequency offset and drift, the CLEP experiment may reach the uncertainty of $3.7\times10^{-6}$ after a measurement session of 60 days. Our results demonstrate that if the issue of frequency offset and drift is solved, CLEP missions have a potential of testing the gravitational redshift with high accuracy.

      <title>Perturbative solutions for compact objects in (2+1)-dimensional Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the space-time geometry generated by compact objects in (2+1)-dimensional Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics. Inspired by previous studies where the Bopp-Podolsky field acts as a source for spherically symmetric solutions, we revisit this question within the lower-dimensional (2+1) framework. Using a perturbative approach, we derive a charged BTZ-like black hole solution and compute corrections up to second order in a perturbative expansion valid far from the horizon. Our analysis suggests that the near-horizon and inner structure of the solution remain unaltered, indicating that no new non-black hole objects emerge in this regime. In particular, we do not find evidence of wormhole solutions in the (2+1)-dimensional version of this theory.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing early universe evolution with gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit (M4OPT), on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <title>Amplitubes: Graph Cosmohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tree-level scattering amplitudes for $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory can be interpreted as a sum over the vertices of a polytope known as the associahedron. For each graph $G$, there exists a natural generalisation of the associahedron, which is constructed by considering tubes and tubings of the underling graph. This family of polytopes are called graph associahedra. The classical associahedra then arise as the graph associahedron for the path graphs. It is therefore natural to associate to each graph associahedron an amplitude-like object, we refer to as the amplitube, defined via a sum over its vertices. Recently, also in the context of trace $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory, progress has been made towards defining a new geometric object, coined the cosmohedron, which computes not the amplitude, but the cosmological wavefunction as a sum over its vertices. This polytope can be constructed by consistently blowing up all boundaries of the associahedron to co-dimension one. Building on these results, in the present paper, we generalise the notion of the wavefunction for arbitrary graphs. These new expressions, which we call cosmological amplitubes, are defined via a sum over the vertices of a corresponding polytope, the graph cosmohedron. The graph cosmohedra are constructed by considering regions and regional tubings of the underlying graph which we introduce. Like the cosmohedron, the graph cosmohedra can be obtained by consistently blowing up all boundaries of the corresponding graph associahedron to co-dimension one. This new family of polytopes constitutes a vast generalisation of the cosmohedron, and we provide explicit embeddings for them, which builds upon an ABHY-like embedding for the graph associahedra.</description>

      <title>Viscous accretion and ejection from tori around black holes in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically perform long-term (millions of Schwarzschild time) axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamics simulations for tori around black holes in general relativity supposing the super Eddington accretion flow. The initial condition for the tori is modeled simply by the Fishbone-Moncrief torus with a constant specific angular momentum $j$ but with a wide variety of $j$. We find that for a given density profile, the fraction of the mass infall onto the black hole is approximately proportional to $j^{-1}$, indicating that only a minor fraction of the matter in the torus formed far from the black hole falls into the black hole while the majority is ejected with the typical average velocity of a few percent of the speed of light. We also find that the mass ejection is driven only outside $\approx 2\,r_\mathrm{ISCO}$ where $r_\mathrm{ISCO}$ is the areal radius of the innermost stable circular orbit around black holes, which depends strongly on the black hole spin. We derive an approximate fitting formula for the spin-dependence on the mass infall fraction as $\propto r_\mathrm{ISCO}^{0.7}$, which suggests that the rapid growth of supermassive black holes proceeded primarily by the accretion of the matter with the angular momentum counter-rotating with the black hole spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured thirty years ago that gravity could arise from the entropic re-arrangement of information. In this paper, we offer a set of microscopic quantum models which realize this idea in detail. In particular, we suggest a simple mechanism by which Newton's law of gravity arises from extremization of the free energy of a collection of qubits or oscillators, rather than from the exchange of virtual quanta of a fundamental field. We give both a local and non-local version of the construction, and show how to distinguish a range of these entropic models from ordinary perturbative quantum gravity using existing observations and near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>QFT on Fuzzy AdS Spaces: Classical Limit and Boundary Correlation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory on two- and three-dimensional fuzzy anti-de Sitter spaces is introduced and studied. We find a complete set of solutions to the fuzzy Klein-Gordon equation and identify the commutative limit in which they reduce to classical scalar field modes. After introducing the noncommutative boundary via semi-classical states, the fuzzy modes are used to obtain the boundary two-point function. In both two and three dimensions, this gives an interesting two-parameter deformation of the conformal two-point function. For the fuzzy AdS$_2$, the two-point function is given explicitly in terms of the Appell function $F_1$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on two vacuum decay models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain two vacuum decay models ($\Lambda(t)$CDM, proposed by the authors of~\cite{Brito:2024bhh}) utilizing the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance prior from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observed by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained via the cosmic chronometers (CC) method and type Ia supernova (SNIa) data. The interaction terms between dark matter and dark energy are defined as $Q=3\varepsilon H\rho_{\Lambda}$ for model I and $3\varepsilon aH\rho_{\Lambda}$ for model II. We find that the decay parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon=0.0094^{+0.0037}_{-0.0033}$ for model I and $\varepsilon=0.0119\pm{0.0045}$ for model II, respectively, indicating a potential interaction between dark matter and dark energy at the $2\sigma$ confidence level. The current Hubble parameter values are estimated to be $H_{0}=70.30\pm{0.67}$ for model I and $H_{0}=70.28\pm{0.64}$ for model II. These values of $H_0$ fall between those derived from the Planck and SH0ES data, suggesting that these two vacuum decay models could provide a potential solution to alleviate the Hubble tension problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, we computed the bispectrum of primordial density perturbations in CMB to second order in the slow-roll parameters of single field inflation, and found logarithmic infrared contributions that diverge in both large physical distances and squeezed limit where one momentum vanishes. In this work, we provide an independent test of the result by checking its conservation and the validity of the consistency relation between the squeezed limit of the bispectrum and the square of the power spectrum. Despite the violation of the main assumption for its general proofs which is the finiteness of the relevant observables in these limits, we find that the identity continues to hold in the vicinity of the squeezed limit and large time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski vacuum in an accelerated frame behaves like a fluid that has not only a finite temperature due to the Unruh effect, but also a finite shear viscosity. Moreover, the ratio of this viscosity to the entropy density exactly satisfies the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound, inspired by the string theory $ \eta/s=1/4\pi $. The origin of this viscosity is purely kinematical and is believed to be related to entanglement introduced by the Rindler horizon. We directly calculate the viscosity, entropy density, and their ratio for massless fields with spins 1/2 and 1. We show that locally the ratio of viscosity to entropy density can be below the limiting value $ 1/4\pi $ at distances of the order of the thickness of the membrane corresponding to the stretched horizon, and is described by the universal function for different spins. In particular, on the membrane surface $ \eta/s=1/8\pi $.</description>

      <title>Towards a Composite Framework for Simultaneous Exploration of New Physics in Background and Perturbed Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate deviations from $\Lambda$CDM by independently parameterizing modifications in the background evolution and the growth of structures. The background is characterized by two parameters, $A$ and $B$, which reduce to $\Omega_{m0}$ and $2/3$ in the $\Lambda$CDM limit, while deviations in the growth of structures are captured through a new fitting function for $f\sigma_8$ involving the growth index $\gamma$. Using recent observational datasets, we find significant evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM, with data suggesting a preference for modifications in the background evolution, likely due to evolving dark energy, rather than modifications to gravity. Additionally, our framework alleviates the $H_0$ tension and addresses the $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ tensions. We also demonstrate that future high-precision RSD data could unveil correlations between background and perturbation parameters that are currently suppressed by observational uncertainties, offering deeper insights into cosmic evolution.</description>

Abstract: In a recent letter, the authors presented a unified derivation of the electric Schwinger effect and a generalized Hawking effect with an additional radiation component. The approach discloses a radial profile of black hole pair production and traces the emission back to local tidal forces which are independent of the black hole event horizon. It uses an effective action valid to second order in curvature and arbitrary order in proper time. A comment on the letter supposed two inconsistencies when applying the central formula to the Schwinger effect in the presence of magnetic fields. The present letter points out that the partially flawed argumentation does not cast doubt on the results.</description>

      <title>Smearing out contact terms in ghost-free infinite derivative quantum gravity</title>

Abstract: In the context of ghost-free infinite derivative gravity, we consider the single graviton exchange between two spinless particles, a spinless particle and a photon, or between a spinless particle and a spin-1/2 particle. To this end, we compute the gravitational potential for the three aforementioned cases and derive the $\mathcal{O}(G\hbar^2)$ correction that arises at the linearised level. In the local theory, it is well-known that such a correction appears in the form of a Dirac delta function. Here, we show that this correction is smeared out for the nonlocal theory and, in contrast to the local theory, takes on non-zero values for a non-zero separation between the two particles. In the case of the single graviton exchange between a spinless particle and a spin-1/2 particle, we also compute the $\mathcal{O}(G\hbar)$ correction that arises in the non-static case within the non-relativistic approximation and show that it is finite in the nonlocal theory.</description>

      <title>Are accelerated detectors sensitive to Planck scale changes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the foremost concerns in the analysis of quantum gravity is whether the locations of classical horizons are stable under a full quantum analysis. In principle, any classical description, when interpolated to the microscopic level, can become prone to fluctuations. The curious question in that case is if there indeed are such fluctuations at the Planck scale, do they have any significance for physics taking place at scales much away from the Planck scale? In this work, we address the question of small scales and address whether there are definitive signatures of Planck scale shifts in the horizon structure. In a recent work (arXiv:2107.03406), it was suggested that in a nested sequence of Rindler causal wedges, the vacua of preceding Rindler frames appear thermally populated to a shifted Rindler frame. The Bogoliubov analysis relies on the global notion of the quantum field theory and turns out to be insensitive to the local character of these horizon shifts. We investigate this system by means of the Unruh-DeWitt detector and see if this local probe of the quantum field theory is sensitive enough to the shift parameters to reveal any microscopic effects. For the case of infinite-time response, we recover the thermal spectrum, thus reaffirming that the infinite-time response probes the global properties of the field. On the other hand, the finite-time response turns out to be sensitive to the shift parameter in a peculiar way that any detector with energy gap $\Omega c/a \sim 1$ and is operational for timescale $T a/c \sim 1$ has a measurably different response for a macroscopic and microscopic shift of the horizon, giving us a direct probe to the tiniest separation between the Rindler wedges. Thus, this study provides an operational method to identify Planck scale effects that can be generalized to various other interesting gravitational settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate black holes and gravitational perturbations when both the scalar Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sectors coexist in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term, and both sectors are coupled to a single canonically normalized scalar field. The presence of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity sector allows the scalar field to possess a non-vanishing background solution, resulting in additional couplings between odd and even-type gravitational perturbations arising from the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sector. We illustrate the impact of these even-odd gravitational couplings in gravitational perturbations around a static spherically symmetric black hole. Although the couplings between the odd and even-type gravitational perturbations are known to appear in purely tensorial gravity theories with higher curvature corrections, we demonstrate it in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Classical general relativity effects by magnetars with massive quadrupole, angular momentum and a magnetic dipole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we obtain classical tests of general relativity using the Hartle-Thorne metric endowed with magnetic dipole and electric charge. This metric represents the approximate stationary spacetime of a massive object with the other characteristics mentioned. These tests are light deflection, time delay, peri-astron precession, and gravitational redshift. We also provide numerical estimates for real magnetars and magnetar candidates from the McGill magnetar catalog, the millisecond pulsar PSR B1257+12 and for the Sun in low-activity cycles. Our results find that, although the magnetic dipole moment contribution tends to be negligible compared to the total amount, its comparison to the massive quadrupole moment and rotational contributions varies from one classical test to the next. For light deflection, the magnetic dipole contribution is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller, compared to the rotational contribution. The magnetic dipole moment contribution is present, but is about 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the second-order rotational contribution to the periastron precession, 5 orders of magnitude smaller for the time delay, and negligible within the approximation presented for the gravitational redshift. The magnetic dipole contribution 1 for the calculations made with PSR B1257+12 was also negligible, but the rotational and quadrupole moment contributions were more significant, which makes the argument for possible future detection stronger than the magnetar case. The rotation, massive quadrupole moment and magnetic dipole contributions for the Sun turned out to be negligible as well.</description>

Abstract: We find the dynamical tidal response of a Kerr black hole (BH) and demonstrate its tidal Love numbers to be non-vanishing when present in a non-axisymmetric external tidal field. To leading order, they depend quadratically on the black hole spin and linearly on the mode frequency. This implies that Kerr BHs are deformable under certain external, time-dependent perturbations. Since non-vanishing tidal Love numbers have been used in compact binary coalescences observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration to infer their non-BH nature, our findings have important implications on such inferences from future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Gravitational Radiation Reaction: Failed Tail, Memories &amp; Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh "in-in" effective field theory (EFT) framework, we complete the knowledge of nonlinear gravitational radiation-reaction effects in the (relative) dynamics of binary systems at fifth Post-Newtonian (5PN) order. Diffeomorphism invariance plays a key role guaranteeing that the Ward identities are obeyed (in background-field gauge). Nonlocal-in-time (memory) effects appear in the soft-frequency limit as boundary terms in the effective action, consistently with the loss of (canonical) angular momentum. We identify a conservative sector through Feynman's $i0^+$-prescription. Notably, terms at second order in the (linear) radiation-reaction force also produce conservative-like effects (as we likewise demonstrate in electromagnetism). For the sake of comparison, we derive the ${\cal O}(G^4)$ contribution to the total (even-in-velocity) 5PN relative scattering angle. We find perfect agreement in the overlap with the state of the art in the Post-Minkowskian expansion, both in the conservative and dissipative sectors, resolving the (apparent) discrepancy with previous EFT results. We will return to the full conservative part of the 5PN dynamics elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Kinetic dynamics of neutral spin particles in a spacetime with torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A kinetic model for the dynamics of collisionless spin neutral particles in a spacetime with torsion is proposed. The fundamental matter field is the kinetic density $f(x,u,s)$ of particles with four-velocity $u$ and four-spin $s$. The stress-energy tensor and the spin current of the particles distribution are defined as suitable integral moments of $f$ in the $(u,s)$ variables. By requiring compatibility with the contracted Bianchi identity in Einstein-Cartan theory, we derive a transport equation on the kinetic density $f$ that generalizes the well-known Vlasov equation for spinless particles. The total number of particles in the new model is not conserved. To restore this important property we assume the existence in spacetime of a second species of particles with the same mass and spin magnitude. The Vlasov equation on the kinetic density $\overline{f}$ of the new particles is derived by requiring that the sum of total numbers of particles of the two species should be conserved.</description>

Abstract: The linear solution for quadrupolar perturbations around de Sitter spacetime was recently constructed. In this paper, we provide the flux-balance laws for each background symmetry (dilatations, rotations, spatial translations and cosmological boosts) in terms of source moments at quadrupolar order. We write the dilatation flux-balance law in two distinct ways, which allows to contrast two distinct proposals for the negative definite energy flux. The standard Poincar\'e flux balance laws at future null infinity are recovered in the flat limit of the $SO(1,4)$ flux-balance laws.</description>

      <title>To bounce or not to bounce in generalized Proca theory and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is notoriously difficult to construct a stable non-singular bouncing cosmology that avoids all possible instabilities throughout the entire evolution of the universe. In this work, we explore whether a non-singular bounce driven by a specific class of modifications of General Relativity, the vector-tensor generalized Proca theories, can be constructed without encountering any pathologies in linear perturbation theory. We find that such models unavoidably lead either to strong coupling in the tensor or the scalar sector, or instabilities in the matter sector during the bouncing phase. As our analysis is performed in a gauge-independent way, this result can be cast in the form of a no-go theorem for non-singular bounces with generalized Proca. In contrast to the no-go theorem found for Horndeski theories, however, it cannot be evaded by considering beyond generalized Proca theory. At the core of our result lies the non-dynamical nature of the temporal component of the vector field, which renders it an ill-suited mediator for a bouncing solution.</description>

Abstract: Scale-independent energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) allows different gravitational couplings for different types of sources and has been proven to have interesting implications in cosmology. In this paper, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism and the latest observational constraints on nuclear abundances are being used to put bounds on this class of modified gravity models. Using the tight constraint from BBN on the correction term in the Friedmann equation in EMSG scenario, we report the allowed deviation from the standard cosmic expansion rate.</description>

      <title>Energy-time uncertainty relation from entropy measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous study, it was shown that the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) can be derived from non-extensive entropies, particularly those depending only on the probability, denoted as $S_\pm$ in the literature. This finding reveals an intriguing connection between non-extensive statistics and quantum gravity. In the present work, we extend our previous result and derive a generalized energy-time uncertainty relation based on a measure of non-extensive entropies. Consequently, the dispersion relation undergoes modifications consistent with those obtained in other approaches to quantum gravity. We interpret these modifications as evidence of the non-extensive behavior of spacetime fluctuations at scales close to the Planck scale. While these effects are significant in this regime, they become negligible in the classical one, i.e. at low energies where the spacetime is smooth. As a consequence of the non-extensive behavior exhibited by spacetime at very small scales, the black hole radiation temperature undergoes quantum-level corrections, increasing in the case of \( S_{-} \) and decreasing for the case of \( S_{+} \). Moreover, the modified uncertainty relation derived here predicts a maximum uncertainty in energy, of the order of Planck energy, and a minimum time interval, of the order of the Planck time, offering new insights into the fundamental structure of spacetime in the quantum regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the boundary wormhole fluctuations of AdS$_{3}$ spacetime and their impact on false vacuum decay. The model consists of three dimensional general relativity coupled to a real scalar field with self-interaction potential. Our analysis focuses on handlebody spacetimes, which correspond to boundary wormhole fluctuations. These fluctuations result in variations in the spacetime genus. Using the dilute wormhole gas approximation, we computed the boundary wormhole creation rate in the semiclassical region. Our results indicate that boundary wormholes are more likely to be created in spacetimes with larger absolute values of the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we find that smaller wormholes are more easily created compared to larger ones. Additionally, we investigated the impact of boundary wormhole fluctuations on false vacuum decay. The vacuum decay rate increases when the effects of wormhole fluctuations are considered. We show that all results remain qualitatively unchanged when certain parameter values are varied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linearised gravity has a global symmetry under which the graviton is shifted by a symmetric tensor satisfying a certain flatness condition. There is also a dual symmetry that can be associated with a global shift symmetry of the dual graviton theory. The corresponding conserved charges are shown to satisfy a centrally-extended algebra. We discuss the gauging of these global symmetries, finding an obstruction to the simultaneous gauging of both symmetries which we interpret as a mixed 't Hooft anomaly for the ungauged theory. We discuss the implications of this, analogous to those resulting from a similar structure in Maxwell theory, and interpret the graviton and dual graviton as Nambu-Goldstone modes for these shift symmetries.</description>

      <title>A Search for Low-Mass Neutron Stars in the Third Observing Run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most observed neutron stars have masses around 1.4 $M_\odot$, consistent with current formation mechanisms. To date, no sub-solar mass neutron star has been observed. Observing a low-mass neutron star would be a significant milestone, providing crucial constraints on the nuclear equation of state, unveiling a new population of neutron stars, and advancing the study of their formation processes and underlying mechanisms. We present the first targeted search for tidally deformed sub-solar mass binary neutron stars (BNS), with primary masses ranging from 0.1 to 2 $M_\odot$ and secondary masses from 0.1 to 1 $M_\odot$, using data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. We account for the tidal deformabilities of up to $O(10^4)$ of these systems, as low-mass neutron stars are more easily distorted by their companions' gravitational forces. Previous searches that neglect tidal deformability lose sensitivity to low-mass sources, potentially missing more than $\sim30\%$ of detectable signals from a system with a chirp mass of 0.6 $M_\odot$ binaries. No statistically significant detections were made. In the absence of a detection, we place a $90\%$ confidence upper limit on the local merger rate for sub-solar mass BNS systems, constraining it to be $&lt; 6.4\times10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for a chirp mass of 0.2 $M_\odot$ and $&lt; 2.2\times 10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for 0.7 $M_\odot$. With future upgrades to detector sensitivity, development of next-generation detectors, and ongoing improvements in search pipelines, constraints on the minimum mass of neutron stars will improve, providing the potential to constrain the nuclear equation of state, reveal new insights into neutron star formation channels, and potentially identify new classes of stars.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger Cosmology: A Route to Accurate Inference of Dark Energy Beyond CPL Parametrization from XG Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the central challenges in modern cosmology is understanding the nature of dark energy and its evolution throughout the history of the Universe. Dark energy is commonly modeled as a perfect fluid with a time-varying equation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$, often modeled under CPL parametrization using two parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. In this study, we explore both parametric and non-parametric methods to reconstruct the dark energy Equation of State (EoS) using Gravitational Wave (GW) sources, with and without electromagnetic (EM) counterparts called bright sirens and dark sirens respectively. In the parametric approach, we extend the widely used $w_0$-$w_a$ model by introducing an additional term, $w_b$, to better capture the evolving dynamics of dark energy up to high redshift which is accessible from GW sources. This extension provides increased flexibility in modeling the EoS and enables a more detailed investigation of dark energy's evolution. Our analysis indicates that, with five years of observation time and a $75\%$ duty cycle using Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, it will be possible to measure the dark energy EoS with remarkable precision, better than any other cosmological probe in the coming years, from bright standard sirens using a multi-messenger approach. These findings highlight the potential of GW observations in synergy with EM telescopes to offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy, overcoming the current limitations in cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>The unitarity crisis, nonviolent unitarization, and implications for quantum spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This contribution overviews the information paradox, or perhaps more aptly "unitarity crisis," and a proposed resolution called nonviolent unitarization. It begins by examining the conflict of principles that yields the crisis, which can be phrased in terms of a "black hole theorem" summarizing how basic assumptions come into conflict. Proposed resolutions of the conflict, along with problems with them, are overviewed. The very important underlying question of localization of information and its role is discussed at some length, taking into account effects of perturbative gravity. The difficulty in finding a consistent scenario for black hole evolution strongly suggests new interactions on event horizon scales; a "minimal" set of assumptions about these are parameterized in nonviolent unitarization. Possible criticisms of this scenario, and some responses, are given. New interactions at event horizon scales potentially lead to observable effects, via gravitational wave or electromagnetic channels, which are briefly discussed. A possible origin of nonviolent unitarization effects from a more fundamental description of quantum spacetime, and possible implications for such a description, are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos: KM3-230213A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. The p-value resulting from our analysis (0.015) is not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would be sufficient to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</description>

      <title>Impact of merger histories on the timing argument estimate of the Local Group mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The timing argument (TA) aims to find the total mass of the Local Group (LG) from the relative motions of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda Galaxy (M31). However, the classical TA always overestimates the LG mass, presumably because it does not account for the hierarchical scenario and other interactions such as that with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We focus on the impact of the recent major merger at M31 by using three merger models to find the peculiar motion of M31 within the simple two-body and point-mass scenario of TA. We found that the merger correction may affect the TA mass by either plus or minus 10-15% depending on the M31 tangential motion, which has very large uncertainties. If we consider a M31 merger configuration that reduces the TA mass by 10-15% to which we add the impact due to the LMC infall into the MW as reported in the literature, the TA mass would be found consistent with the LG mass from Hubble-Lemaitre flow. Galaxies are expected to experience about 16 major mergers each since z=11.5. Assuming all these mergers have similar impact on the TA mass as the most recent M31 merger, the ratio of LG mass to TA mass would be $0.85^{+0.65}_{-0.37}$ and such a TA mass is consistent with all the LG mass estimates. Our result also agrees with the findings using LG analogues in the cosmological simulations. We find that the TA mass estimate is limited by the hierarchical scenario, since it not possible to track the progenitors of both MW and M31 through so many mergers. We conclude that the MW-M31 dynamical system is far too complex to be modelled as a simple two-body point mass system.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on the structure of strange quark stars in one-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of scalar dark matter on the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) within a one-fluid framework, considering Yukawa interactions between dark matter and quark matter. Contributions from perturbative QCD, Yukawa interaction between scalar dark matter and quarks, and Bose-Einstein condensation of dark matter are included in the model. We first determine the allowable range of Yukawa interaction coupling by imposing the stability condition for strange quark matter (SQM). Using this range, we derive the equation of state (EOS) for different fractions of dark matter within the total pressure of SQS. These fractions are constrained by the tidal deformability limit from GW170817. The presence of dark matter alters the EOS, leading to changes in the mass-radius relationship, tidal deformability, and stability of SQS. We demonstrate that increasing the mass of dark matter softens the EOS, whereas higher fractions of dark matter lead to stiffer EOSs. We also explore the reasons behind this behavior. Our EOSs not only describe massive objects, such as PSR J0952-0607 and PSR J2215+5135, but also satisfy the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817. These results reveal that incorporating dark matter modifies the EOS, enabling the support of higher stellar masses while maintaining consistency with observational data.</description>
