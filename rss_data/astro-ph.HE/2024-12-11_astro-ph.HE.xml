      <title>A Multiwavelength Autopsy of the Interacting IIn Supernova 2020ywx: Tracing its Progenitor Mass-Loss History for 100 Years before Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the subclass of interacting supernovae with narrow hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) consists of some of the longest-lasting and brightest SNe ever discovered, their progenitors are still not well understood. Investigating SNe IIn as they emit across the electromagnetic spectrum is the most robust way to understand the progenitor evolution before the explosion. This work presents X-Ray, optical, infrared, and radio observations of the strongly interacting Type IIn SN 2020ywx covering a period $&gt;1200$ days after discovery. Through multiwavelength modeling, we find that the progenitor of 2020ywx was losing mass at $\sim10^{-2}$--$10^{-3} \mathrm{\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ for at least 100 yr pre-explosion using the circumstellar medium (CSM) speed of $120$ km/s measured from our optical and NIR spectra. Despite the similar magnitude of mass-loss measured in different wavelength ranges, we find discrepancies between the X-ray and optical/radio-derived mass-loss evolution, which suggest asymmetries in the CSM. Furthermore, we find evidence for dust formation due to the combination of a growing blueshift in optical emission lines and near-infrared continuum emission which we fit with blackbodies at $\sim$ 1000 K. Based on the observed elevated mass loss over more than 100 years and the configuration of the CSM inferred from the multiwavelength observations, we invoke binary interaction as the most plausible mechanism to explain the overall mass-loss evolution. SN 2020ywx is thus a case that may support the growing observational consensus that SNe IIn mass loss is explained by binary interaction.</description>

      <title>Influence of the turbulent magnetic pressure on isothermal jet emitting disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of jet emitting disks (JEDs) provides a mathematical framework for a self-consistent treatment of steady-state accretion and ejection. A large-scale vertical magnetic field threads the accretion disk where magnetic turbulence occurs in a strongly magnetized plasma. A fraction of mass leaves the disk and feeds the two laminar super-Alf\'enic jets. In previous treatments of JEDs, the disk turbulence has been considered to provide only anomalous transport coefficients, namely magnetic diffusivities and viscosity. However, 3D numerical experiments show that turbulent magnetic pressure also sets in. We included this additional pressure term using a prescription that is consistent with the latest 3D global (and local) simulations. We then solved the complete system of self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, accounting for all dynamical terms. The disk becomes puffier and less electrically conductive, causing radial and toroidal electric currents to flow at the disk surface. Field lines within the disk become straighter, with their bending and shearing occurring mainly at the surface. Accretion remains supersonic, but becomes faster at the disk surface. Large values of both turbulent pressure and magnetic diffusivities allow powerful jets to be driven, and their combined effects have a constructive influence. Nevertheless, cold outflows do not seem to be able to reproduce mass-loss rates as large as those observed in numerical simulations. Our results are a major upgrade of the JED theory, allowing a direct comparison with full 3D global numerical simulations. We argue that JEDs provide a state-of-the-art mathematical description of the disk configurations observed in numerical simulations, commonly referred to as magnetically arrested disks (MADs). However, further efforts from both theoretical and numerical perspectives are needed to firmly establish this point.</description>

      <title>M87: a cosmic laboratory for deciphering black hole accretion and jet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been significant progress in our understanding of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that drive active galactic nuclei (AGNs), both from observational and theoretical perspectives. As an iconic target for this area of study, the nearby giant elliptical galaxy M87 has received special attention thanks to its proximity, large mass of the central black hole and bright emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to very-high-energy gamma rays. In particular, recent global millimeter-very-long-baseline-interferometer observations towards this nucleus have provided the first-ever opportunity to image the event-horizon-scale structure of an AGN, opening a new era of black hole astrophysics. On large scales, M87 exhibits a spectacular jet propagating far beyond the host galaxy, maintaining its narrowly collimated shape over seven orders of magnitude in distance. Elucidating the generation and propagation, as well as the internal structure, of powerful relativistic jets remains a longstanding challenge in radio-loud AGNs. M87 offers a privileged opportunity to examine such a jet with unprecedented detail. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the observational knowledge accumulated about the M87 black hole across various wavelengths. We cover both accretion and ejection processes at spatial scales ranging from outside the Bondi radius down to the event horizon. By compiling these observations and relevant theoretical studies, we aim to highlight our current understanding of accretion and jet physics for this specific object.</description>

      <title>The impact on astrometry by solar-wind effect in pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry of pulsars, particularly their distances, serves as a critical input for various astrophysical experiments using pulsars. Pulsar timing is a primary approach for determining a pulsar's position, parallax, and distance. In this paper, we explore the influence of the solar wind on astrometric measurements obtained through pulsar timing, focusing on its potential to affect the accuracy of these parameters. Using both theoretical calculation and mock-data simulations, we demonstrate a significant correlation between the pulsar position, annual parallax and the solar-wind density parameters. This correlation strongly depends on the pulsar's ecliptic latitude. We show that fixing solar-wind density to an arbitrary value in the timing analysis can introduce significant bias in the estimated pulsar position and parallax, and its significance is highly dependent on the ecliptic latitude of the pulsar and the timing precision of the data. For pulsars with favourable ecliptic latitude and timing precision, the astrometric and solar-wind parameters can be measured jointly with other timing parameters using single-frequency data. The parameter correlation can be mitigated by using multi-frequency data, which also significantly improves the measurement precision of these parameters; this is particularly important for pulsars at a medium or high ecliptic latitude. Additionally, for a selection of pulsars we reprocess their EPTA Data Release 2 data to include modelling of solar-wind effect in the timing analysis. This delivers significant measurements of both parallax and solar-wind density, the latter of which are consistent with those obtained at low-frequency band. In the future, combining pulsar timing data at gigahertz and lower frequencies will probably deliver the most robust and precise measurements of astrometry and solar wind properties in pulsar timing.</description>

      <title>The High Time Resolution Universe Pulsar Survey-XIX. A coherent GPU accelerated reprocessing and the discovery of 71 pulsars in the Southern Galactic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a GPU accelerated reprocessing of $\sim 87\%$ of the archival data from the High Time Resolution Universe South Low Latitude (HTRU-S LowLat) pulsar survey by implementing a pulsar search pipeline that was previously used to reprocess the Parkes Multibeam pulsar survey (PMPS). We coherently searched the full 72-min observations of the survey with an acceleration search range up to $|50|\, \rm m\,s^{-2}$, which is most sensitive to binary pulsars experiencing nearly constant acceleration during 72 minutes of their orbital period. Here we report the discovery of 71 pulsars, including 6 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) of which five are in binary systems, and seven pulsars with very high dispersion measures (DM $&gt;800 \, \rm pc \, cm^{-3}$). These pulsar discoveries largely arose by folding candidates to a much lower spectral signal-to-noise ratio than previous surveys, and exploiting the coherence of folding over the incoherent summing of the Fourier components to discover new pulsars as well as candidate classification techniques. We show that these pulsars could be fainter and on average more distant as compared to both the previously reported 100 HTRU-S LowLat pulsars and background pulsar population in the survey region. We have assessed the effectiveness of our search method and the overall pulsar yield of the survey. We show that through this reprocessing we have achieved the expected survey goals including the predicted number of pulsars in the survey region and discuss the major causes as to why these pulsars were missed in previous processings of the survey.</description>

      <title>Exploring the circumstellar environment of Tycho's supernova remnant. II. Impact on the broadband non-thermal emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the environment around Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) has long been believed to be close to homogeneous, the latest analysis of Chandra data has identified a substantial deceleration of the forward shock which poses a major challenges to this picture. arXiv:2310.14841 showed that the existence of dense molecular cloud (MC) surrounding a rarefied wind-like circumstellar matter (CSM) can explain this observational finding in term of the shock-expansion dynamics, supporting the so-called single-degenerate scenario for the progenitor system. We here extend this work to study the non-thermal emission processes and investigate whether such an environment is consistent with the observed multi-wavelength spectrum. While the simulated broadband spectrum based on the wind-MC environment is largely consistent with observations, we find that such an environment predicts a harder gamma-ray spectrum than observed due to the relatively low CSM density in the cavity interior of the MC. This difference can be at least partially attributed to the present one-dimensional setup of the model which does not account for the clumpy and multi-dimensional structure of the CSM. Our model provides predictions for the long-term evolution of the broadband spectrum which can be used to further probe Tycho's surrounding environment in the future, a key to resolving the long-standing issue of type Ia supernova progenitor channels.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Black Hole Candidate Population in M51's Young Massive Star Clusters: Constraints on Accreting Intermediate Mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate mass black holes (10^2 &lt; M_BH&lt; 10^5 Msun) are an open question in our understanding of black hole evolution and growth. They have long been linked to dense star cluster environments thanks to cluster dynamics, but there are a limited number of secure detections. We leverage existing X-ray observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory and optical catalogs from Hubble Space Telescope with new radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to search for any evidence of accreting black holes in young massive clusters in the nearby galaxy M51. We find that of 43 bright ($L_X &gt; 10^{38}$ erg/s) X-ray point sources in M51, 24 had probable matches to objects including possible associated star clusters in the HST Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey catalog, seven of which were classified as contaminants (background galaxies or foreground stars). We explore the optical properties of the remaining 17 sources, including cluster age and mass estimates, and search for radio counterparts in the 8-12 GHz band. The lack of radio counterparts to X-ray sources we know to be associated with young massive clusters in M51 suggests that we do not significantly detect hard-state IMBHs ~ 10^4 Msun or above. However, more sensitive radio facilities like the Square Kilometre Array and next generation Very Large Array may be able to provide evidence for IMBHs with masses down to ~ 10^3 Msun.</description>

      <title>Detection and parameter estimation of supermassive black hole ringdown signals using a pulsar timing array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) searches using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are commonly assumed to be limited to a GW frequency of $\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$Hz given by the Nyquist rate associated with the average observational cadence of $2$ weeks for a single pulsar. However, by taking advantage of asynchronous observations of multiple pulsars, a PTA can detect GW signals at higher frequencies. This allows a sufficiently large PTA to detect and characterize the ringdown signals emitted following the merger of supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), leading to stringent tests of the no-hair theorem in the mass range of such systems. Such large-scale PTAs are imminent with the advent of the FAST telescope and the upcoming era of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). To scope out the data analysis challenges involved in such a search, we propose a likelihood-based method coupled with Particle Swarm Optimization and apply it to a simulated large-scale PTA comprised of $100$ pulsars, each having a timing residual noise standard deviation of $100$~nsec, with randomized observation times. Focusing on the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of the ringdown signal, we show that it is possible to achieve a $99\%$ detection probability with a false alarm probability below $0.2\%$ for an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$. This corresponds, for example, to an equal-mass non-spinning SMBBH with an observer frame chirp mass $M_c = 9.52\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ at a luminosity distance of $D_L = 420$ Mpc.</description>

      <title>NICER Spectral and Timing Analysis of 4U 1630$-$47 and its Heartbeat State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectral and timing analysis of NICER observations of the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 from 2018 to 2024. We find relativistic reflection features in the hard and soft intermediate states, and disk wind absorption features in the soft intermediate state and soft state. We fit the reflection features with RELXILLCP and find a stable and untruncated disk in the intermediate states; we fit the wind features with ZXIPCF and find a stable, highly ionized wind with high column density across different outbursts. Specifically, the heartbeat state is seen in two observations in 2021 and 2023 respectively. Through the phase-resolved spectral fitting, we find the flux to be correlated with the disk parameters while no strong correlation with the coronal parameters is observed, consistent with the scenario given by the inner disk radiation instability. A significant hard lag on the time scale of a second and high coherence is observed near the characteristic frequency of the heartbeat, which can be explained by the viscous propagation of mass accretion fluctuations in the disk. The positive relationship between the heartbeat fractional rms and energy can possibly be explained by a disk-originated oscillation which is then magnified by the corona scattering.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation at High Redshifts from Multiband of GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the gravity quantum theory, the quantization of spacetime may lead to the modification of the dispersion relation between the energy and the momentum and the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). High energy and long-distance gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observations in the universe provide a unique opportunity to test the possibility of LIV. In this paper, by using 93 time delay GRBs covering the redshift range of $0.117 &lt; z &lt; 6.29$, we present a new idea of using cosmological model-independent (based on the luminosity distance data from 174 GRBs) to test the LIV. Combining the observation data from multiband of GRBs provides us with an opportunity to mitigate the potential systematic errors arising from variations in the physical characteristics among diverse object populations, and to add a higher redshift dataset for testing the energy-dependent velocity caused by the corrected dispersion relationship of photons. These robust limits of the energy scale for the linear and quadratic LIV effects are $E_{QG,1} \ge 1.40\times 10^{15}$ GeV, and $E_{QG,2} \ge 8.18\times 10^{9}$ GeV, respectively. It exhibits a significantly reduced value compared to the energy scale of Planck in both scenarios of linear and quadratic LIV.</description>

      <title>A generalized effective potential for differentially rotating plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global stability of differentially rotating plasma is investigated using a generalized effective potential. We first, for a current-free system, obtain a general form of an effective potential in terms of the free energies of global curvature and gradients of rotation for non-axisymmetric disturbances. We then examine the stability of differentially rotating disks for several rotation profiles and present the associated effective potential for the onset of these instabilities in the MHD regime. In particular, results for global axisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) as well as local and global non-axisymmetric modes are presented. The latter constitute two distinct non-axisymmetric modes, a high frequency local MRI and a global low-frequency non-axisymmetric mode (the magneto-curvature mode, introduced in Ebrahimi&amp;Pharr, ApJ 2022), confined either between two Alfv\'enic resonances or an Alfv\'enic resonance and a boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors opens new opportunities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger events, holding significant potential for probing the history of cosmic expansion. In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model by using the future GW standard siren data observed from the 3G GW detectors and the short $\gamma$-ray burst THESEUS-like detector joint observations. We find that GW data alone can achieve a relatively precise estimation of the Hubble constant, with precision of $0.2\%$-$0.6\%$, but its ability to constrain other cosmological parameters remains limited. Nonetheless, since the GW data can break parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS), GW standard sirens play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. With the addition of GW data to CBS, the constraints on cosmological parameters $H_0$, $c$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ can be improved by $63\%$-$88\%$, $27\%$-$44\%$ and $55\%$-$70\%$. In summary, observations of GW standard sirens from 3G GW detectors could be pivotal in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum III: Precessing Quadrupole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very long-term evolution of the hierarchical restricted three-body problem with a slightly aligned precessing quadrupole potential is investigated analytically and solved for both rotating and librating Kozai-Lidov cycles (KLCs) with high eccentricities. We describe the finding of a striking similarity between librating and rotating KLCs for some range of precession rates. We show that the main effect occurs in both categories when the KLC frequency is equal to the precession rate of the perturbing potential. We solve the resonant dynamics analytically and show that it is equivalent to a simple pendulum model allowing us to map the strikingly rich structures that arise for precession rates similar to the Kozai-Lidov timescale (ratio of a few) and explain the similarity and when it vanishes. Additionally, we show that the regular KLCs at high eccentricities can also be described using a simple pendulum.</description>

      <title>Merging black holes with Cauchy-characteristic matching: Computation of late-time tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present successful evolutions of binary black hole mergers using a novel numerical-relativity technique known as Cauchy-characteristic matching (CCM). This approach eliminates systematic errors associated with boundary conditions, effectively extending the computational domain to infinity. As an important application, we use CCM to resolve a late-time power-law tail in the gravitational wave from a head-on collision, and show that the tail is highly suppressed in a quasi-circular binary. Our results for the two extreme cases (orbital eccentricity $=0,1$) support the fact that tails increase with orbital eccentricity. Therefore, CCM paves the way for a detailed understanding of tails in eccentric systems. For the head-on case, we find that the tail behavior is consistent with predictions in the intermediate regime from black hole linear perturbation theory. However, we also raise the possibility that the power-law tail could be generated nonlinearly by quasinormal modes. The nonlinear contribution is expected to decay slower than predicted by Price's law, potentially dominating the signal at late times. If confirmed as nonlinear, this would be an example where nonlinearity prevails over linearity in the late-time regime of black hole dynamics.</description>

      <title>NRSurNN3dq4: A Deep Learning Powered Numerical Relativity Surrogate for Binary Black Hole Waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave approximants are widely used tools in gravitational-wave astronomy. They allow for dense coverage of the parameter space of binary black hole (BBH) mergers for purposes of parameter inference, or, more generally, match filtering tasks, while avoiding the computationally expensive full evolution of numerical relativity simulations. However, this comes at a slight cost in terms of accuracy when compared to numerical relativity waveforms, depending on the approach. One way to minimize this is by constructing so-called~\textit{surrogate models} which, instead of using approximate physics or phenomenological formulae, rather interpolate within the space of numerical relativity waveforms. In this work, we introduce~\texttt{NRSurNN3dq4}, a surrogate model for non-precessing BBH merger waveforms powered by neural networks. By relying on the power of deep learning, this approximant is remarkably fast and competitively accurate, as it can generate millions of waveforms in a tenth of a second, while mismatches with numerical relativity waveforms are restrained below $10^{-3}$. We implement this approximant within the~\textsc{bilby} framework for gravitational-wave parameter inference, and show that it it is suitable for parameter estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Signature of the Gravity Wave Phase Shift in a Cold Quark Star with a Nonconvex Multicomponent van der Waals Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonclassical Bethe - Zel'dovich-Thompson (BZT) rarefaction shocks and the QCD phase transition in the dense core of a cold quark star in beta equilibrium subject to the multicomponent van der Waals (MvdW) equation of state (EoS) as a model of internal structure. When this system is expressed in terms of multiple components it can be used to explore the impact of a phase transition from a hadronic state to a quark plasma state with a complex clustering structure. The clustering can take the form of colored diquarks or triquarks and bound colorless meson, baryon, or hyperon states at the phase transition boundary. The resulting multicomponent EoS system is nonconvex which can give rise to nonclassical BZT phase changing shock waves. Using the BZT shock wave condition we find constraints on the quark density and examine how this changes the compactness and tidal deformability of the compact core. These results are then combined with the TOV equations to find the changes in the mass-radius relationship. These states are compared to the recent astrophysical high mass neutron star systems which may provide evidence for a core that has undergone a quark-gluon phase transition such as PSR 0943+10 or GW 190814.</description>

      <title>VLASS-based survey of transition state galaxies and their relationship to compact peaked-spectrum radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multi-frequency and high-resolution studies of a sample of 24 radio transients sources discovered by comparing the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) surveys. All of them are characterized by a significant increase in radio flux density over the last two decades.Their convex spectra, small sizes and high brightness temperatures are typical for young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources and indicative of an AGN buried in the host galaxy. On the other hand, they are much weaker than the archetypical GPS objects and their parsec-scale radio structures, although indicating the presence of young radio jets, are similar to radio-quiet AGNs like Seyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxies. Based on the distribution of these objects in power$-$size ($P - D$) and peak frequency$-$size ($\nu_p - D$) diagrams, we suggest that after stabilizing their radio activity, some of the GHz-peaked radio transients (galaxies and quasars) will develop into radio-intermediate and radio-quiet (RI/RQ) quasars and low-frequency peaked-spectrum (PS) objects. We discuss several possible origins for the transient radio emission in our sources and conclude that changes in the accretion rate combined with low-power radio ejecta are the most probable cause. This is the scenario we also propose for one of our sources, 101841$-$13, which was independently identified as a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) based on its infrared variability. However, we cannot exclude that 101841$-$13 or other sources in our sample are TDEs.</description>

      <title>Runaway O and Be stars found using Gaia DR3, new stellar bow shocks and search for binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A relevant fraction of massive stars are runaways, moving with a significant peculiar velocity with respect to their environment. Kicks from supernova explosions or the dynamical ejection of stars from clusters can account for the runaway genesis. We have used Gaia DR3 data to study the velocity distribution of massive O and Be stars from the GOSC and BeSS catalogs and identify runaway stars using a 2D-velocity method. We have discovered 42 new runaways from GOSC and 47 from BeSS, among a total of 106 and 69 runaways found within these catalogs, respectively. These numbers imply a percentage of runaways of ~25% for O-type stars ~5% for Be-type stars. The higher percentages and higher velocities found for O-type compared to Be-type runaways suggest that the dynamical ejection scenario is more likely than the supernova explosion scenario. We have also performed multi-wavelength studies of our runaways. We have used WISE infrared images to discover 13 new stellar bow shocks around the runaway stars. We have also conducted VLA radio observations of some of these bow shocks. Finally, our runaway stars include six X-ray binaries and one gamma-ray binary, implying that new such systems could be found by conducting detailed multi-wavelength studies. In this work we report on this ongoing project to find new runaway stars, study their interaction with the ISM and search for high-energy binary systems.</description>

      <title>Fastest spinning millisecond pulsars: indicators for quark matter in neutron stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rotating hybrid stars, with a particular emphasis on the effect of a deconfinement phase transition on their properties at high spin. Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state with a phase transition from hypernuclear matter to color-superconducting quark matter, where both phases are described within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the vector and diquark couplings of quark matter, we obtain different hybrid star sequences with varying extension of the quark matter core, ensuring consistency with astrophysical constraints from mass, radius and tidal deformability measurements. We demonstrate the impact of an increasing rotational frequency on the maximum gravitational mass, the central energy density of compact stars, the rise of the quasi-radial oscillations and non-axisymmetric instabilities. We demonstrate that for the most favorable parameter sets with a strong vector coupling, hybrid star configurations with color-superconducting quark matter core can describe the fastest spinning and heaviest galactic pulsar J0952-0607, while it is out of reach for the purely hadronic hypernuclear star configuration.
  We also revise the previously proposed empirical relation between the Kepler frequency, gravitational mass, and radius of non-rotating neutron stars, obtained based on the assumption that all neutron stars, up to the heaviest, are hadronic. We show how the phase transition to quark matter alters this relation and, consequently, the constraints on the dense matter equation of state. Our findings reveal that incorporating the hybrid equation of state has significant implications for the constraints on the properties of strongly interacting matter and neutron stars, placing the upper limit on $R_{1.4}\leq14.90$ km (considering the 716 Hz frequency limit from J1748+2446ad) and $R_{1.4}\leq$11.90~km (for 1000 Hz).</description>

      <title>Milli-to-Deci-Hertz Detection Prospects for Gravitational Waves from Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy truly began with the detection of merging compact binaries. The next breakthrough lies in detecting GWs from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), particularly the GW linear memory -- a phenomenon arising from aspherical matter ejection and anisotropic neutrino emission during stellar collapse. In this Letter, we examine the feasibility of detecting this effect using next-generation space-based GW detectors or lunar-based GW observatories as this signature peaks below 25 Hz, which is largely inaccessible to terrestrial GW detectors due to seismic noise. Such a detection would provide fundamental insights into asymmetric matter dynamics near the collapsed core, shedding light on the stellar corpse that once represented the mass of the progenitor star and offering a front row seat to the potential formation of either a nascent neutron star progenitor or a black hole. Leveraging the longest-duration three-dimensional CCSNe simulations to date, spanning a wide range of progenitor masses, we show that space-based and lunar GW detectors present the most promising opportunities to extend the current CCSNe GW detection horizon (~ 10 kiloparsecs) to several megaparsecs. This may pave the way for regularly observing GWs from CCSNe beyond our Milky Way by utilizing the distinctive environments of space and the Moon to augment terrestrial detection efforts all the while synergistically advancing sophisticated data analysis techniques for routine GW detection.</description>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are immensely energetic radio pulses with durations of milliseconds. Given their high all-sky rate, the probability of an FRB being lensed by an intervening massive object is non-negligible. In this study, we search for possible lensing candidates within the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment FRB catalogue using an autocorrelation algorithm and verification through signal simulations. We identify FRB 20190308C as a lensed candidate with a significance of 3.4 sigma. Furthermore, we constrain the mass of the lensing object using the Chang-Refsdal lens model, based on the flux ratio and time delay between the substructures of FRB 20190308C. Future long-term and high-precision observations are expected to reveal more lensed FRBs.</description>

      <title>Generating ultra-compact neutron stars with bosonic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the properties of neutron stars admixed with selfinteracting scalar bosonic dark matter. The dark matter interaction is described by a generalized $\phi^n$ power-law potential. We perform a stability analysis of these two-fluid objects by studying the onset of the unstable radial modes. We find ultra-compact neutron star-dark matter configurations where the neutron star matter is confined to a core radius of values below $7$ km which is unreachable for pure neutron stars. The total gravitational maximum mass of these ultra-compact configurations can have values of $3.4 \, M_\odot$. With our general ansatz of the power-law potential we show that the compactness of these solutions can be extreme, i.e. the compactness is $C = 1/3$ or even larger, making them compact enough to have a light-ring mimicking black holes. These ultra-compact objects are stable and possess a dark matter halo while having a hadronic matter core. With the addition of dark matter to neutron stars recent unusual mass-radius measurements of compact stars can be explained. We conclude that apparently contradictory measurements of neutron star masses and radii could be not only an indication of the presence of dark matter around a the hadronic matter core which is stabilized by the gravitational potential of dark matter but could also serve to disentangle the selfinteraction strength of dark matter. Our work points to a stiff equation of state for the dark matter fluid, rather than a soft one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613 ended its 10-month discovery outburst on June of 2024, when it reached an optical brightness comparable to pre-discovery magnitudes. With the aim of performing a dynamical study, we launched an optical spectroscopy campaign with the GTC telescope. We detect the companion star and construct its radial velocity curve, yielding a binary orbital period of Porb = 10.8038 +- 0.0010 h and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of K2 = 390 +- 4 km/s. This results in a mass function of f(M1)=2.77 +- 0.09 Msun. Combined with constraints on the binary inclination, it sets a lower limit to the compact object mass of M1 &gt; 3.12 +- 0.10 Msun, dynamically confirming the black hole nature of the accretor. Comparison of the average spectrum in the rest frame of the companion with synthetic stellar templates supports a K4V donor partially veiled (74%) by the accretion disc. A refined distance measurement of 3.7+- 0.3 kpc, together with the astrometric proper motion and the systemic velocity derived from the radial velocity curve (181 +-4 km/s), supports a natal kick velocity of 220 +40 -50 km/s, at the upper end of the observed distribution.</description>

      <title>Evolution and the quasistationary state of collective fast neutrino flavor conversion in three dimensions without axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate in this work the evolution of the collective fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) in a three dimensional (3D) cubic box with periodic boundary condition for three different neutrino angular distributions that are axially asymmetric. We find that the system evolves toward a quasistationary state where the angular distribution of the spatially averaged neutrino electron-minus-muon lepton number (ELN) does not contain any crossings. In the quasistationary state, near flavor equilibration is achieved in one angular domain enclosed by the initial ELN angular crossing contour, similar to the conclusion derived based on simplified one dimensional (1D) system with axially symmetric neutrino angular distributions. We have also performed additional simulations in coordinates where the initial first ELN angular moment has only one nonvanishing spatial component by using the original axially asymmetric ELN angular distributions as well as the corresponding axisymmetric ELN distributions, and find interesting similarity between these two sets. Finally, we propose three different analytical prescriptions generalized from earlier 1D models to 3D models, and evaluate their performances in predicting the post-FFC moments. Our findings suggest that further development of effective classical transport model in multidimensions to capture the effect of FFC is promising.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of common envelope stage in close binary systems: comparison between Newtonian and modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the important stage in evolution of close binary system namely common envelope phase in framework of various models of modified gravity. The comparison of results between calculations in Newtonian gravity and modified gravity allows to estimate possible observational imprints of modified gravity. Although declination from Newtonian gravity should be negligible we can propose that due to the long times some new effects can appear. We use the moving-mesh code AREPO for numerical simulation of binary system consisting of $\sim M_{\odot}$ white dwarf and a red giant with mass $\sim 2 M_{\odot}$. For implementing modified gravity into AREPO code we apply the method of (pseudo)potential, assuming that modified gravity can be described by small corrections to usual Newtonian gravitational potential. As in Newtonian case initial orbit has to shrink due to the energy transfer to the envelope of a giant. We investigated evolution of common envelope in a case of simple model of modified gravity with various values of parameters and compared results with simulation in frames of Newtonian gravity.</description>

      <title>Transients by Black Hole Formation from Red Supergiants: Impact of Dense Circumstellar Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Failed supernovae (SNe), which are likely the main channel for forming stellar-mass black holes, are predicted to accompany mass ejections much weaker than typical core-collapse SNe. We conduct a grid of one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations to explore the emission of failed SNe from red supergiant progenitors, leveraging recent understanding of the weak explosion and the dense circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding these stars. We find from these simulations and semi-analytical modeling that diffusion in the CSM prolongs the early emission powered by shock breakout/cooling. The early emission has peak luminosities of $\sim 10^7$-$10^8~L_\odot$ in optical and UV, and durations of days to weeks. The presence of dense CSM aids detection of the early bright peak from these events via near-future wide-field surveys such as Rubin Observatory, ULTRASAT and UVEX.</description>

      <title>Physics-driven Explosions of Stripped High-Mass Stars: Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra of Stripped-Envelope Supernovae with Broad Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) represent a significant fraction of core-collapse supernovae, arising from massive stars that have shed their hydrogen and, in some cases, helium envelopes. The origins and explosion mechanisms of SESNe remain a topic of active investigation. In this work, we employ radiative-transfer simulations to model the light curves and spectra of a set of explosions of single, solar-metallicity, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars with ejecta masses ranging from 4 to 11 Msun, that were computed from a turbulence-aided and neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. We analyze these synthetic observables to explore the impact of varying ejecta mass and helium content on observable features. We find that the light curve shape of these progenitors with high ejecta masses is consistent with observed SESNe with broad light curves but not the peak luminosities. The commonly used analytic formula based on rising bolometric light curves overestimates the ejecta mass of these high-initial-mass progenitor explosions by a factor up to 2.6. In contrast, the calibrated method by Haynie et al., which relies on late-time decay tails, reduces uncertainties to an average of 20% within the calibrated ejecta mass range.Spectroscopically, the He I 1.083 um line remains prominent even in models with as little as 0.02 Msun of helium. However, the strength of the optical He I lines is not directly proportional to the helium mass but instead depends on a complex interplay of factors such as 56Ni distribution, composition, and radiation field. Thus, producing realistic helium features requires detailed radiative transfer simulations for each new hydrodynamic model.</description>

      <title>GRB241107A: a Giant Flare from a close-by extragalactic Magnetar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results on the short gamma-ray burst GRB 241107A, obtained with the IBIS instrument on board the INTEGRAL satellite. The burst had a duration of about 0.2 s, a fluence of $8 \times 10^{-7}$ erg cm-2 in the 20 keV-10 MeV range and a hard spectrum, characterized by a peak energy of 680 keV. The position of GRB 241107A has been precisely determined because it fell inside the imaging field of view of the IBIS coded mask instrument. The presence of the nearby galaxy PGC 86046 in the 3 arcmin radius error region, suggests that GRB 241107A might be a giant flare from a magnetar rather than a canonical short GRB. For the 4.1 Mpc distance of PGC 86046, the isotropic energy of $1.6 \times 10^{45}$ erg is in agreement with this hypothesis, that is also supported by the time resolved spectral properties similar to those of the few other extragalactic magnetars giant flares detected so far.</description>

      <title>Efficient Massive Black Hole Binary parameter estimation for LISA using Sequential Neural Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inspiral, merger, and ringdown of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs) is one the main sources of Gravitational Waves (GWs) for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA-led mission in the implementation phase. It is expected that LISA will detect these systems throughout the entire observable universe. Robust and efficient data analysis algorithms are necessary to detect and estimate physical parameters for these systems. In this work, we explore the application of Sequential Neural Likelihood, a simulation-based inference algorithm, to detect and characterize MBHB GW signals in synthetic LISA data. We describe in detail the different elements of the method, their performance and possible alternatives that can be used to enhance the performance. Instead of sampling from the conventional likelihood function, which requires a forward simulation for each evaluation, this method constructs a surrogate likelihood that is ultimately described by a neural network trained from a dataset of simulations of the MBHB signals and noise. One important advantage of this method is that, given that the likelihood is independent of the priors, we can iteratively train models that target specific observations in a fraction of the time and computational cost that other traditional and machine learning-based strategies would require. Because of the iterative nature of the method, we are able to train models to obtain qualitatively similar posteriors with less than 2\% of the simulator calls that Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods would require. We compare these posteriors with those obtained from Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques and discuss the differences that appear, in particular in relation with the important role that data compression has in the modular implementation of the method that we present.</description>

      <title>A novel probe of graviton dispersion relations at nano-Hertz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalise Phinney's 'practical theorem' to account for modified graviton dispersion relations motivated by certain cosmological scenarios. Focusing on specific examples, we show how such modifications can induce characteristic localised distortions, bumps, in the frequency profile of the stochastic gravitational wave background emitted from distant binary sources. We concentrate on gravitational waves at nano-Hertz frequencies probed by pulsar timing arrays, and we forecast the capabilities of future experiments to accurately probe parameters controlling modified dispersion relations. Our predictions are based on properties of gravitational waves emitted in the first inspiral phase of the binary process, and do not rely on assumptions of non-linear effects occurring during the binary merging phase</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>Investigating the asymmetry of young stellar outflows: Combined MUSE-X-shooter study of the Th 28 jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterising stellar jet asymmetries is key to setting robust constraints on jet launching models and improving our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind jet launching. We aim to characterise the asymmetric properties of the bipolar jet coming from the Classical T Tauri Star Th 28. We combined data from integral field spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE and high-resolution spectra from VLT/X-shooter to map the optical emission line ratios in both jet lobes. We carried out a diagnostic analysis of these ratios to compare the density, electron temperature, and ionisation fraction within both lobes. The mass accretion rate was derived from the emission lines at the source and compared with the mass outflow rate derived for both lobes, using the estimated densities and measured [O I]6300 and [S II ]6731 luminosities. The blue-shifted jet exhibits a significantly higher electron temperature and moderately higher ionisation fraction than the red-shifted jet. In contrast to previous studies, we also estimated higher densities in the blue-shifted jet by a factor of ~2. These asymmetries are traced to within 160 au of the source in the line ratio maps. We estimate the mass accretion rate onto the central star and compare this with estimates of the mass outflow rates through each side of the jet. The emission line maps and diagnostic results suggest that the jet asymmetries originate close to the source and are likely to be intrinsic to the jet. Furthermore, the combined dataset offers access to a broad array of accretion tracers. In turn, this enables a more accurate estimation of the mass accretion rate, revealing a value of Macc that is higher by a factor &gt;350 than would otherwise be determined. Supplementary figures and tables are available via a public Zenodo repository (doi:10.5281/zenodo.13373809).</description>
