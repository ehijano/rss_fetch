      <title>Therapy as an NLP Task: Psychologists' Comparison of LLMs and Human Peers in CBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wider access to therapeutic care is one of the biggest challenges in mental health treatment. Due to institutional barriers, some people seeking mental health support have turned to large language models (LLMs) for personalized therapy, even though these models are largely unsanctioned and untested. We investigate the potential and limitations of using LLMs as providers of evidence-based therapy by using mixed methods clinical metrics. Using HELPERT, a prompt run on a large language model using the same process and training as a comparative group of peer counselors, we replicated publicly accessible mental health conversations rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to compare session dynamics and counselor's CBT-based behaviors between original peer support sessions and their reconstructed HELPERT sessions. Two licensed, CBT-trained clinical psychologists evaluated the sessions using the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale and provided qualitative feedback. Our findings show that the peer sessions are characterized by empathy, small talk, therapeutic alliance, and shared experiences but often exhibit therapist drift. Conversely, HELPERT reconstructed sessions exhibit minimal therapist drift and higher adherence to CBT methods but display a lack of collaboration, empathy, and cultural understanding. Through CTRS ratings and psychologists' feedback, we highlight the importance of human-AI collaboration for scalable mental health. Our work outlines the ethical implication of imparting human-like subjective qualities to LLMs in therapeutic settings, particularly the risk of deceptive empathy, which may lead to unrealistic patient expectations and potential harm.</description>

      <title>Teen Talk: The Good, the Bad, and the Neutral of Adolescent Social Media Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The debate on whether social media has a net positive or negative effect on youth is ongoing. Therefore, we conducted a thematic analysis on 2,061 posts made by 1,038 adolescents aged 15-17 on an online peer-support platform to investigate the ways in which these teens discussed popular social media platforms in their posts and to identify differences in their experiences across platforms. Our findings revealed four main emergent themes for the ways in which social media was discussed: 1) Sharing negative experiences or outcomes of social media use (58%, n = 1,095), 2) Attempts to connect with others (45%, n = 922), 3) Highlighting the positive side of social media use (20%, n = 409), and 4) Seeking information (20%, n = 491). Overall, while sharing about negative experiences was more prominent, teens also discussed balanced perspectives of connection-seeking, positive experiences, and information support on social media that should not be discounted. Moreover, we found statistical significance for how these experiences differed across social media platforms. For instance, teens were most likely to seek romantic relationships on Snapchat and self-promote on YouTube. Meanwhile, Instagram was mentioned most frequently for body shaming, and Facebook was the most commonly discussed platform for privacy violations (mostly from parents). The key takeaway from our study is that the benefits and drawbacks of teens' social media usage can co-exist and net effects (positive or negative) can vary across different teens across various contexts. As such, we advocate for mitigating the negative experiences and outcomes of social media use as voiced by teens, to improve, rather than limit or restrict, their overall social media experience. We do this by taking an affordance perspective that aims to promote the digital well-being and online safety of youth "by design."</description>

      <title>Examining Caregiving Roles to Differentiate the Effects of Using a Mobile App for Community Oversight for Privacy and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a 4-week field study with 101 smartphone users who self-organized into 22 small groups of family, friends, and neighbors to use ``CO-oPS,'' a mobile app for co-managing mobile privacy and security. We differentiated between those who provided oversight (i.e., caregivers) and those who did not (i.e., caregivees) to examine differential effects on their experiences and behaviors while using CO-oPS. Caregivers reported higher power use, community trust, belonging, collective efficacy, and self-efficacy than caregivees. Both groups' self-efficacy and collective efficacy for mobile privacy and security increased after using CO-oPS. However, this increase was significantly stronger for caregivees. Our research demonstrates how community-based approaches can benefit people who need additional help managing their digital privacy and security. We provide recommendations to support community-based oversight for managing privacy and security within communities of different roles and skills.</description>

      <title>Assembling the Puzzle: Exploring Collaboration and Data Sensemaking in Nursing Practices for Remote Patient Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02579v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) involves the remote collection and transmission of patient health data, serving as a notable application of data-driven healthcare. This technology facilitates clinical monitoring and decision-making, offering benefits like reduced healthcare costs and improved patient outcomes. However, RPM also introduces challenges common to data-driven healthcare, such as additional data work that can disrupt clinician's workflow. This study explores the daily practices, collaboration mechanisms, and sensemaking processes of nurses in RPM through field observations and interviews with six stakeholders. Preliminary results indicate that RPM's scale-up pushes clinicians toward asynchronous collaboration. Data sensemaking is crucial for this type of collaboration, but existing technologies often create friction rather than support. This work provides empirical insights into clinical workflow in nursing practice, especially RPM. We suggest recognizing data sensemaking as a distinct nursing practice within data work and recommend further investigation into its role in the workflow of nurses in RPM.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Visual Analytics: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the integration of large language models (LLMs) into visual analytics (VA) systems to transform their capabilities through intuitive natural language interactions. We survey current research directions in this emerging field, examining how LLMs are integrated into data management, language interaction, visualisation generation, and language generation processes. We highlight the new possibilities that LLMs bring to VA, especially how they can change VA processes beyond the usual use cases. We especially highlight building new visualisation-language models, allowing access of a breadth of domain knowledge, multimodal interaction, and opportunities with guidance. Finally, we carefully consider the prominent challenges of using current LLMs in VA tasks. Our discussions in this paper aim to guide future researchers working on LLM-assisted VA systems and help them navigate common obstacles when developing these systems.</description>

      <title>Design Contradictions: Help or Hindrance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for innovative ideas in data visualisation drives us to explore new creative approaches. Combining two or more creative words, particularly those that contradict each other, can positively impact the creative process, sparking novel ideas and designs. As we move towards AI-driven design, an open question arises: do these design contradictions work positively with AI tools? Currently, the answer is no. AI systems, like large language models (LLMs), rely on algorithms that engender similarity, whereas creativity often requires divergence and novelty. This poster initiates a conversation on how to drive AI systems to be more creative and generate new ideas. This research invites us to reconsider traditional design methods and explore new approaches in an AI-driven world. Can we apply the same techniques used in traditional design, like the double diamond model, or do we need new methods for design engineering? How can we quickly design visualisations and craft new ideas with generative AI? This paper seeks to start this critical conversation and offers practical insights into the potential of AI in driving creativity in data visualisation.</description>

      <title>GraphTrials: Visual Proofs of Graph Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph and network visualization supports exploration, analysis and communication of relational data arising in many domains: from biological and social networks, to transportation and powergrid systems. With the arrival of AI-based question-answering tools, issues of trustworthiness and explainability of generated answers motivate a greater role for visualization. In the context of graphs, we see the need for visualizations that can convince a critical audience that an assertion about the graph under analysis is valid. The requirements for such representations that convey precisely one specific graph property are quite different from standard network visualization criteria which optimize general aesthetics and readability. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive introduction to visual proofs of graph properties and a foundation for further research in the area. We present a framework that defines what it means to visually prove a graph property. In the process, we introduce the notion of a visual certificate, that is, a specialized faithful graph visualization that leverages the viewer's perception, in particular, pre-attentive processing (e.g. via pop-out effects), to verify a given assertion about the represented graph. We also discuss the relationships between visual complexity, cognitive load and complexity theory, and propose a classification based on visual proof complexity. Finally, we provide examples of visual certificates for problems in different visual proof complexity classes.</description>

      <title>EgoPressure: A Dataset for Hand Pressure and Pose Estimation in Egocentric Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating touch contact and pressure in egocentric vision is a central task for downstream applications in Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, as well as many robotic applications, because it provides precise physical insights into hand-object interaction and object manipulation. However, existing contact pressure datasets lack egocentric views and hand poses, which are essential for accurate estimation during in-situ operation, both for AR/VR interaction and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we introduce EgoPressure,a novel dataset of touch contact and pressure interaction from an egocentric perspective, complemented with hand pose meshes and fine-grained pressure intensities for each contact. The hand poses in our dataset are optimized using our proposed multi-view sequence-based method that processes footage from our capture rig of 8 accurately calibrated RGBD cameras. EgoPressure comprises 5.0 hours of touch contact and pressure interaction from 21 participants captured by a moving egocentric camera and 7 stationary Kinect cameras, which provided RGB images and depth maps at 30 Hz. In addition, we provide baselines for estimating pressure with different modalities, which will enable future developments and benchmarking on the dataset. Overall, we demonstrate that pressure and hand poses are complementary, which supports our intention to better facilitate the physical understanding of hand-object interactions in AR/VR and robotics research.</description>

      <title>Initial Development and Evaluation of the Creative Artificial Intelligence through Recurring Developments and Determinations (CAIRDD) System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer system creativity is a key step on the pathway to artificial general intelligence (AGI). It is elusive, however, due to the fact that human creativity is not fully understood and, thus, it is difficult to develop this capability in software. Large language models (LLMs) provide a facsimile of creativity and the appearance of sentience, while not actually being either creative or sentient. While LLMs have created bona fide new content, in some cases - such as with harmful hallucinations - inadvertently, their deliberate creativity is seen by some to not match that of humans. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a technique for enhancing LLM output creativity via an iterative process of concept injection and refinement. Initial work on the development of the Creative Artificial Intelligence through Recurring Developments and Determinations (CAIRDD) system is presented and the efficacy of key system components is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Coral Model Generation from Single Images for Virtual Reality Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of VR technology, the demand for high-quality 3D models is increasing. Traditional methods struggle with efficiency and quality in large-scale customization. This paper introduces a deep-learning framework that generates high-precision 3D coral models from a single image. Using the Coral dataset, the framework extracts geometric and texture features, performs 3D reconstruction, and optimizes design and material blending. Advanced optimization and polygon count control ensure shape accuracy, detail retention, and flexible output for various complexities, catering to high-quality rendering and real-time interaction needs.The project incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) to transform AI-generated models into interactive "artworks," best viewed in VR and XR. This enhances model interpretability and human-machine collaboration. Real-time feedback in VR interactions displays information like coral species and habitat, enriching user experience. The generated models surpass traditional methods in detail, visual quality, and efficiency. This research offers an intelligent approach to 3D content creation for VR, lowering production barriers, and promoting widespread VR applications. Additionally, integrating XAI provides new insights into AI-generated visual content and advances research in 3D vision interpretability.</description>

      <title>What is lost in Normalization? Exploring Pitfalls in Multilingual ASR Model Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the pitfalls in evaluating multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, with a particular focus on Indic language scripts. We investigate the text normalization routine employed by leading ASR models, including OpenAI Whisper, Meta's MMS, Seamless, and Assembly AI's Conformer, and their unintended consequences on performance metrics. Our research reveals that current text normalization practices, while aiming to standardize ASR outputs for fair comparison, by removing inconsistencies such as variations in spelling, punctuation, and special characters, are fundamentally flawed when applied to Indic scripts. Through empirical analysis using text similarity scores and in-depth linguistic examination, we demonstrate that these flaws lead to artificially inflated performance metrics for Indic languages. We conclude by proposing a shift towards developing normalization routines that leverage native linguistic expertise, ensuring more robust and accurate evaluations of multilingual ASR models.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning-Aided Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research in ML4VIS investigates how to use machine learning (ML) techniques to generate visualizations, and the field is rapidly growing with high societal impact. However, as with any computational pipeline that employs ML processes, ML4VIS approaches are susceptible to a range of ML-specific adversarial attacks. These attacks can manipulate visualization generations, causing analysts to be tricked and their judgments to be impaired. Due to a lack of synthesis from both visualization and ML perspectives, this security aspect is largely overlooked by the current ML4VIS literature. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential vulnerabilities of ML-aided visualizations from adversarial attacks using a holistic lens of both visualization and ML perspectives. We first identify the attack surface (i.e., attack entry points) that is unique in ML-aided visualizations. We then exemplify five different adversarial attacks. These examples highlight the range of possible attacks when considering the attack surface and multiple different adversary capabilities. Our results show that adversaries can induce various attacks, such as creating arbitrary and deceptive visualizations, by systematically identifying input attributes that are influential in ML inferences. Based on our observations of the attack surface characteristics and the attack examples, we underline the importance of comprehensive studies of security issues and defense mechanisms as a call of urgency for the ML4VIS community.</description>

      <title>Want a Ride? Attitudes Towards Autonomous Driving and Behavior in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research conducted previously has focused on either attitudes toward or behaviors associated with autonomous driving. In this paper, we bridge these two dimensions by exploring how attitudes towards autonomous driving influence behavior in an autonomous car. We conducted a field experiment with twelve participants engaged in non-driving related tasks. Our findings indicate that attitudes towards autonomous driving do not affect participants' driving interventions in vehicle control and eye glance behavior. Therefore, studies on autonomous driving technology lacking field tests might be unreliable for assessing the potential behaviors, attitudes, and acceptance of autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>More is More: Addition Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the presence of additive bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing a parallel to the cognitive bias observed in humans where individuals tend to favor additive over subtractive changes. Using a series of controlled experiments, we tested various LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral, Math$\Sigma$tral, and Llama 3.1, on tasks designed to measure their propensity for additive versus subtractive modifications. Our findings demonstrate a significant preference for additive changes across all tested models. For example, in a palindrome creation task, Llama 3.1 favored adding letters 97.85% of the time over removing them. Similarly, in a Lego tower balancing task, GPT-3.5 Turbo chose to add a brick 76.38% of the time rather than remove one. In a text summarization task, Mistral 7B produced longer summaries in 59.40% to 75.10% of cases when asked to improve its own or others' writing. These results indicate that, similar to humans, LLMs exhibit a marked additive bias, which might have implications when LLMs are used on a large scale. Addittive bias might increase resource use and environmental impact, leading to higher economic costs due to overconsumption and waste. This bias should be considered in the development and application of LLMs to ensure balanced and efficient problem-solving approaches.</description>

Abstract: Exploration is a key part of many video games. We investigate the using an exploratory agent to provide feedback on the design of procedurally generated game levels, 5 engaging levels and 5 unengaging levels. We expand upon a framework introduced in previous research which models motivations for exploration and introduce a fitness function for evaluating an environment's potential for exploration. Our study showed that our exploratory agent can clearly distinguish between engaging and unengaging levels. The findings suggest that our agent has the potential to serve as an effective tool for assessing procedurally generated levels, in terms of exploration. This work contributes to the growing field of AI-driven game design by offering new insights into how game environments can be evaluated and optimised for player exploration.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Error Detection System for Advanced Vehicle Instrument Cluster Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automotive industry is currently expanding digital display options with every new model that comes onto the market. This entails not just an expansion in dimensions, resolution, and customization choices, but also the capability to employ novel display effects like overlays while assembling the content of the display cluster. Unfortunately, this raises the need for appropriate monitoring systems that can detect rendering errors and apply appropriate countermeasures when required. Classical solutions such as Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) will soon be no longer viable as any sort of alpha blending, warping of scaling of content can cause unwanted CRC violations. Therefore, we propose a novel monitoring approach to verify correctness of displayed content using telltales (e.g. warning signs) as example. It uses a learning-based approach to separate "good" telltales, i.e. those that a human driver will understand correctly, and "corrupted" telltales, i.e. those that will not be visible or perceived correctly. As a result, it possesses inherent resilience against individual pixel errors and implicitly supports changing backgrounds, overlay or scaling effects. This is underlined by our experimental study where all "corrupted" test patterns were correctly classified, while no false alarms were triggered.</description>

      <title>The Future of Open Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16961</link>

Abstract: Human feedback on conversations with language language models (LLMs) is central to how these systems learn about the world, improve their capabilities, and are steered toward desirable and safe behaviors. However, this feedback is mostly collected by frontier AI labs and kept behind closed doors. In this work, we bring together interdisciplinary experts to assess the opportunities and challenges to realizing an open ecosystem of human feedback for AI. We first look for successful practices in peer production, open source, and citizen science communities. We then characterize the main challenges for open human feedback. For each, we survey current approaches and offer recommendations. We end by envisioning the components needed to underpin a sustainable and open human feedback ecosystem. In the center of this ecosystem are mutually beneficial feedback loops, between users and specialized models, incentivizing a diverse stakeholders community of model trainers and feedback providers to support a general open feedback pool.</description>

      <title>Seeing Like an AI: How LLMs Apply (and Misapply) Wikipedia Neutrality Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on broad corpora and then used in communities with specialized norms. Is providing LLMs with community rules enough for models to follow these norms? We evaluate LLMs' capacity to detect (Task 1) and correct (Task 2) biased Wikipedia edits according to Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy. LLMs struggled with bias detection, achieving only 64% accuracy on a balanced dataset. Models exhibited contrasting biases (some under- and others over-predicted bias), suggesting distinct priors about neutrality. LLMs performed better at generation, removing 79% of words removed by Wikipedia editors. However, LLMs made additional changes beyond Wikipedia editors' simpler neutralizations, resulting in high-recall but low-precision editing. Interestingly, crowdworkers rated AI rewrites as more neutral (70%) and fluent (61%) than Wikipedia-editor rewrites. Qualitative analysis found LLMs sometimes applied NPOV more comprehensively than Wikipedia editors but often made extraneous non-NPOV-related changes (such as grammar). LLMs may apply rules in ways that resonate with the public but diverge from community experts. While potentially effective for generation, LLMs may reduce editor agency and increase moderation workload (e.g., verifying additions). Even when rules are easy to articulate, having LLMs apply them like community members may still be difficult.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the precision of the HTC VIVE Ultimate Tracker with robotic and human movements under varied environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The HTC VIVE Ultimate Tracker, utilizing inside-out tracking with internal stereo cameras providing 6 DoF tracking without external cameras, offers a cost-efficient and straightforward setup for motion tracking. Initially designed for the gaming and VR industry, we explored its application beyond VR, providing source code for data capturing in both C++ and Python without requiring a VR headset. This study is the first to evaluate the tracker's precision across various experimental scenarios. To assess the robustness of the tracking precision, we employed a robotic arm as a precise and repeatable source of motion. Using the OptiTrack system as a reference, we conducted tests under varying experimental conditions: lighting, movement velocity, environmental changes caused by displacing objects in the scene, and human movement in front of the trackers, as well as varying the displacement size relative to the calibration center. On average, the HTC VIVE Ultimate Tracker achieved a precision of 4.98 mm +/- 4 mm across various conditions. The most critical factors affecting accuracy were lighting conditions, movement velocity, and range of motion relative to the calibration center. For practical evaluation, we captured human movements with 5 trackers in realistic motion capture scenarios. Our findings indicate sufficient precision for capturing human movements, validated through two tasks: a low-dynamic pick-and-place task and high-dynamic fencing movements performed by an elite athlete. Even though its precision is lower than that of conventional fixed-camera-based motion capture systems and its performance is influenced by several factors, the HTC VIVE Ultimate Tracker demonstrates adequate accuracy for a variety of motion tracking applications. Its ability to capture human or object movements outside of VR or MOCAP environments makes it particularly versatile.</description>
