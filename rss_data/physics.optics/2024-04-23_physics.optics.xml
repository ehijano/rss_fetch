      <title>Nonlinear Coupling Coefficients in Multimode Fibers for the Strong Coupling Regime Within Mode Groups and Across Mode Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear coupling coefficients appearing in the Manakov equations for multimode fibers (MMF) for space-division multiplexing operating in the two regimes of strong coupling only within mode groups and strong coupling also across mode groups. The analysis is mainly focused on the trenchless parabolic graded-index MMFs, but considerations on the step-index profile, and on the use of realistic trenches and non-parabolic indices are given. Analytic results for the Manakov nonlinearity coefficients are derived for the first time, and validation is performed through a numerical approach. We show that the coefficients are approximately independent on the fiber core radius and refractive index difference, but depend only on the number of guided modes. Values of nonlinear coefficients are computed also for optimized and manufactured MMFs described in the literature, and are placed within the developed framework. The impact of a poor fiber design on the achievable data rates of the MMF nonlinear channel is discussed for a simple scenario.</description>

      <title>Infrared resonance-lattice device technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present subwavelength resonant lattices fashioned as nano- and microstructured films as a basis for a host of device concepts. Whereas the canonical physical properties are fully embodied in a one-dimensional periodic lattice, the final device constructs are often patterned in two-dimensionally-modulated films in which case we may refer to them as photonic crystal slabs, metamaterials, or metasurfaces. These surfaces can support lateral modes and localized field signatures with propagative and evanescent diffraction channels critically controlling the response. The governing principle of guided-mode, or lattice, resonance enables diverse spectral expressions such that a single-layer component can behave as a sensor, reflector, filter, or polarizer. This structural sparsity contrasts strongly with the venerable field of multi-layer thin-film optics that is basis for most optical components on the market today. The lattice resonance effect can be exploited in all major spectral regions with appropriate low-loss materials and fabrication resources. In this paper, we highlight resonant device technology and present our work on design, fabrication, and characterization of optical elements operating in the near-IR, mid-IR, and long-wave IR spectral regions. Examples of fabricated and tested devices include biological sensors, high-contrast-ratio polarizers, narrow-band notch filters, and wideband high reflectors.</description>

      <title>Electrically generated exciton polaritons with spin on-demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation and manipulation of exciton polaritons with controllable spin could deeply impact spintronic applications, quantum simulations, and quantum information processing, but is inherently challenging due to the charge neutrality of the polariton and the device complexity it requires. In this work, we demonstrate electrical generation of spin-polarized exciton polaritons in a monolithic dielectric perovskite metasurface embedded in a light-emitting transistor. A finely tailored interplay of in- and out-of-plane symmetry breaking of the metasurface allows to lift the spin degeneracy through the polaritonic Rashba effect, yielding high spin purity with normalized Stokes parameter of S3~0.8. Leveraging on spin-momentum locking, the unique metatransistor device architecture enables electrical control of spin and directionality of the polaritonic emission. This work advances the development of compact and tunable spintronic devices, and represents an important step toward the realization of electrically pumped inversionless spin-lasers.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emission decay and excitation in photonic temporal crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, the prominent strategies for controlling spontaneous emission has been the use of resonant or space-periodic photonic structures. This approach, initially articulated by Purcell and later expanded upon by Yablonovitch in the context of photonic crystals, leverages the spatial surroundings to modify the spontaneous emission decay rate of atoms or quantum emitters. However, the rise of time-varying photonics has compelled a reevaluation of the spontaneous emission process within dynamically changing environments, especially concerning photonic temporal crystals where optical properties undergo time-periodic modulation. Here, we apply classical light-matter interaction theory along with Floquet analysis to reveal a substantial enhancement in the spontaneous emission decay rate at the momentum gap frequency in photonic temporal crystals. This enhancement is attributed to time-periodicity-induced loss and gain mechanisms, as well as the non-orthogonality of Floquet eigenstates that are inherent to photonic temporal crystals. Intriguingly, our findings also suggest that photonic temporal crystals enable the spontaneous excitation of an atom from its ground state to an excited state, accompanied by the concurrent emission of a photon.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Wigner function of electron beams based on coherence measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a reconstruction method for the density matrix and Wigner function of electron beams through analysis of the Airy pattern intensity profile. The density matrix in a transmission electron microscope object plane was calculated using the coherence function and the electron wave amplitude and phase distributions. The Wigner function was then reconstructed using the matrix elements. Based on the Wigner function at the origin of the phase space, we derived a formula to calculate the axial brightness, and then measured the axial brightness of a Schottky field emission gun, which reflects the emitter performance more accurately and precisely than the conventional mean brightness measurements.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-loss integrated photonics enables bright, narrow-band, photon-pair sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-pair sources are critical building blocks for photonic quantum systems. Leveraging Kerr nonlinearity and cavity-enhanced spontaneous four-wave mixing, chip-scale photon-pair sources can be created using microresonators built on photonic integrated circuit. For practical applications, a high microresonator quality factor $Q$ is mandatory to magnify photon-pair sources' brightness and reduce their linewidth. The former is proportional to $Q^4$, while the latter is inversely proportional to $Q$. Here, we demonstrate an integrated, microresonator-based, narrow-band photon-pair source. The integrated microresonator, made of silicon nitride and fabricated using a standard CMOS foundry process, features ultralow loss down to $3$ dB/m and intrinsic $Q$ factor exceeding $10^7$. The photon-pair source has brightness of $1.17\times10^9$ Hz/mW$^2$/GHz and linewidth of $25.9$ MHz, both of which are record values for silicon-photonics-based quantum light source. It further enables a heralded single-photon source with heralded second-order correlation $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{h}(0)=0.0037(5)$, as well as a time-bin entanglement source with a raw visibility of $0.973(9)$. Our work evidences the global potential of ultralow-loss integrated photonics to create novel quantum light sources and circuits, catalyzing efficient, compact and robust interfaces to quantum communication and networks.</description>

      <title>Foundry manufacturing of octave-spanning microcombs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs provide a chip-based, octave-spanning source for self-referencing and optical metrology. We explore use of a silicon-nitride integrated photonics foundry to manufacture octave-spanning microcombs. By group-velocity dispersion engineering with the waveguide cross-section, we shape the soliton spectrum for dispersive-wave spectral enhancements at the frequencies for f-2f self-referencing. With the optimized waveguide geometry, we control the carrier-envelope offset frequency by adjusting the resonator radius. Moreover, we demonstrate the other considerations for octave microcombs, including models for soliton spectrum design, ultra-broadband resonator external coupling, low-loss edge couplers, and the nonlinear self-interactions of few-cycle solitons. This design process permits highly repeatable creation of soliton microcombs optimized for pump operation less than 100 mW, an electronically detectable offset frequency, and high comb mode power for f-2f detection. However, these design aspects must also be made compatible with the foundry fabrication tolerance of octave microcomb devices. Our experiments highlight the potential to manufacture a single-chip solution for an octave-spanning microcomb, which is the central component of a compact microsystem for optical metrology.</description>

      <title>Interference of high-order perfect optical vortex beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interference of high-order perfect optical vortex (POV) beams with different topological charges. Through numerical simulations, we reveal a remarkable phenomenon: keeping the beam width, and beam radius fixed while changing the topological charge, the splitting of the composite POV beam into two distinct individual perfect vortices occurs exactly at the same inter-axial separation. The observed interference pattern exhibits pronounced sensitivity to factors such as axial separation, phase shift, beam radius, and topological charges of the constituent beams. Notably, our findings are contrasted with the interference of high-order Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams, highlighting that the splitting of composite vortices into their individual components is more rapid in the case of LG beams. Our research provides significant insights into the distinct interference properties of high-order POV beams, presenting potential applications in the fields of optical manipulation and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable Nanoislands Decorated Tapered Optical Fibers Reveal Concurrent Contributions in Through-Fiber SERS Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating plasmonic nanoparticles on a tapered optical fiber tip enables a remote SERS sensing probe, ideal for challenging sampling scenarios like biological tissue, specific cells, on-site environmental monitoring, and deep brain structures. However, nanoparticle patterns fabricated from current bottom-up methods are mostly random, making geometry control difficult. Uneven statistical distribution, clustering, and multilayer deposition introduce uncertainty in correlating device performance with morphology. Here, we employ a tunable solid-state dewetting method to create densely packed monolayer Au nanoislands (NIs) with varied geometric parameters, directly contacting the silica TF surface. These patterns exhibit analyzable nanoparticle sizes, densities, and uniform distribution across the entire taper surface, enabling a systematic investigation of particle size, density, and analyte effects on the SERS performance of the through-fiber detection system. The study is focused on the SERS response of a widely employed benchmark Rhodamine 6G molecule and Serotonin, a neurotransmitter with high relevance for the neuroscience field. The numerical simulations and limit of detection (LOD) experiments on R6G show that the increase of the total near-field enhancement volume promotes the SERS sensitivity of the probe. However, for serotonin we observed a different behavior linked to its interaction with the nanoparticle's surface. The obtained LOD is as low as 10-7 M, a value not achieved so far in a through-fiber detection scheme. Therefore, we believe our work offers a strategy to design nanoparticle-based remote SERS sensing probes and provide new clues to discover and understand the intricate plasmonic-driven chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Unique multistable states in periodic structures with saturable nonlinearity. I. Conventional case and unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we predict that periodic structures without gain and loss do not exhibit an S-shaped hysteresis curve in the presence of saturable nonlinearity (SNL). Instead, the input-output characteristics of the system admit ramp-like optical bistability (OB) and multistability (OM) curves that are unprecedented in the context of conventional periodic structures in the literature. An increase in the nonlinearity (NL) or the gain-loss parameter increases the switch-up and down intensities of different stable branches in a ramp-like OM curve. Revival of the typical S-shaped hysteresis curve requires the device to work under the combined influence of frequency detuning and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. An increase in the detuning, NL and gain-loss parameters reduces the switching intensities of the S-shaped OB (OM) curves. During the process, mixed OM curves that feature a fusion between ramp-like and S-shaped OM curves emanate at low values of the detuning parameter in the input-output characteristics. The detuning parameter values for which ramp-like, S-shaped, and mixed OM appear varies with the NL coefficient. For a given range of input intensities, the number of stable states admitted by the system increases with the device length or NL. When the laser light enters the device from the opposite end of the grating, nonreciprocal switching occurs at ultra-low intensities via an interplay between NL, detuning, and gain-loss parameters.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Ring Airy vortex beam and Ring Pearcey vortex beam in turbulent atmosphere and a comparative analysis of their channel efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optical vortex beam propagating through turbulent atmosphere encounters distortions in the wavefront that results in modal scattering. Abruptly autofocussing (AAF) beams with orbital angular momentum have gained significant attention due to their non-diffracting and self-healing nature. These warrants understanding of the behaviour of these beams through turbulent atmosphere absolutely necessary. With this intuition, in the present work we investigate the behaviour of two AAF beams namely ring Airy vortex beam (RAVB) and ring Pearcey vortex beam (RPVB) through the turbulent atmosphere in two cases: multiplexed and non-multiplexed. We propagate multiplexed as well as non-multiplexed RAVB and RPVB in different levels of turbulent atmosphere. In non-multiplexed case, channel efficiency declines for both the beams with increase in modes numbers. In multiplexed case, increasing the gap between the mode sets results in decrease in channel efficiency. We also report that in weak atmospheric turbulence RAVB outperform RPVB in terms of channel efficiency. We use optical transformation sorting (log-polar) method to demultiplex the optical beams at the output. Furthermore, we investigate and compare the OAM spectra of both beams in different levels of atmospheric turbulence and at different propagation distances. The comparison reveals that the spectra of RPVB is more dispersive as compared to that of RAVB.</description>

      <title>Unique multistable states in periodic structures with saturable nonlinearity. II. Broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we observe that the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric fiber Bragg gratings (PTFBGs) with saturable nonlinearity (SNL) exhibit ramp-like, mixed, optical multistability (OM) in the broken regime. The interplay between nonlinearity and detuning parameter plays a central role in transforming the characteristics of the hysteresis curves and facilitates the realization of different OM curves. Also, it plays a crucial role in reducing the switch-up and down intensities of various stable branches of an OM curve. In a mixed OM curve, either the ramp-like hysteresis curves or S-like hysteresis curves can appear predominantly depending on the magnitude of the detuning parameter. An increase in the device length or nonlinearity increases the number of stable states for fixed values of input intensity. Under a reversal in the direction of light incidence, the ramp-like OM and mixed OM curves assume an unusual vortex-like envelope at lower intensities. Numerical simulations reveal that the switch-up and down intensities of different stable branches of a ramp-like OM and mixed OM curves drift towards the higher and lower intensity sides, respectively (opposite direction). The drift is severe to the extent that an intermediate hysteresis curve features switch-down action at near-zero switching intensities. Also, the input intensities required to realize ramp-like, and mixed OM curves reduce dramatically under a reversal in the direction of light incidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering, especially multiple scattering, is a well known problem in imaging, ranging from astronomy to medicine. In particular it is often desirable to be able to perform non-invasive imaging through turbid and/or opaque media. Many different approaches have been proposed and tested through the years, each with their own advantages, disadvantages, and specific situations in which they work. In this tutorial we will show how knowledge of the correlations arising from the multiple scattering of light allows for non-invasive imaging through a strongly scattering layer, with particular attention on the practicalities of how to make such an experiment work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical and analytical study was conducted to investigate the bifurcation mechanisms that cause desynchronization between the soliton repetition frequency and the frequency of external pulsed injection in a Kerr cavity described by the Lugiato-Lefever equation. The results suggest that desynchronization typically occurs through an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation. Additionally, a simple and intuitive criterion for this bifurcation to occur is proposed.</description>

      <title>185 mW, 1 MHz, 15 fs carrier-envelope phase-stable pulse generation via polarization-optimized down-conversion from gas-filled hollow-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-filled hollow core fibers allow the generation of single-cycle pulses at megahertz repetition rates. When coupled with difference frequency generation, they can be an ideal driver for the generation of carrier-envelope phase stable, octave-spanning pulses in the short-wavelength infrared. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the polarization state in gas-filled hollow-core fibers on the subsequent difference frequency generation stage. We show that by adjusting the input polarization state of light in geometrically symmetric systems, such as hollow-core fibers, one can achieve precise control over the polarization state of the output pulses. Importantly, this manipulation preserves the temporal characteristics of the ultrashort pulses generated, especially when operating near the single-cycle regime. We leverage this property to boost the down-conversion efficiency of these pulses in a type I difference frequency generation stage. Our technique overcomes the bandwidth and dispersion constraints of the previous methods that rely on broadband waveplates or adjustment of crystal axes relative to the laboratory frame. This advancement is crucial for experiments demanding pure polarization states in the eigenmodes of the laboratory frame.</description>

      <title>Temporal characterization of laser pulses using an air-based knife-edge technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the characterization of ultrashort laser pulses by using the plasma-induced frequency resolved optical switching (PI-FROSt) technique, implemented in ambient air. This recently developed method allows for a temporal reconstruction of a pulse at its focal spot by utilizing a moderately intense pump laser pulse for generating an ionization-induced ultrafast defocusing lens. When propagating through the produced plasma lens, the probe beam to characterize experiences an increase of its size in the far field. The spectrum of the defocused probe field, measured as a function of the pump-probe delay, allows for a comprehensive characterization of the temporal and spectral attributes of the pulse. We report herein the ability of this technique, initially designed for use in rare gases, to operate in ambient air conditions with similar performance. The method is remarkably straightforward to implement and requires no additional optical component other than a focusing mirror, while delivering laser pulse reconstructions of high reliability.</description>

      <title>Modeling the focusing of a radially-polarized laser beam with an initially flat-top intensity profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radially-polarized light beams present very interesting and useful behavior for creating small intensity spots when tightly-focused, and manipulating nanostructures or charged particles. The modeling of the propagation of such vector beams, however, is almost always done using the lowest-order fundamental radially-polarized beam due to the complexity of vector diffraction theory. We show how a flat-top radially-polarized beam can be modeled analytically using a sum of higher-order beams, and describe a number of interesting qualities, and compare to numerically-solved integral descriptions.</description>

      <title>Robust electrothermal switching of optical phase change materials through computer-aided adaptive pulse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrically tunable optical devices present diverse functionalities for manipulating electromagnetic waves by leveraging elements capable of reversibly switching between different optical states. This adaptability in adjusting their responses to electromagnetic waves after fabrication is crucial for developing more efficient and compact optical systems for a broad range of applications including sensing, imaging, telecommunications, and data storage. Chalcogenide-based phase change materials (PCMs) have shown great promise due to their stable, non-volatile phase transition between amorphous and crystalline states. Nonetheless, optimizing the switching parameters of PCM devices and maintaining their stable operation over thousands of cycles with minimal variation can be challenging. In this paper, we report on the critical role of PCM pattern as well as electrical pulse form in achieving reliable and stable switching, extending the operational lifetime of the device beyond 13,000 switching events. To achieve this, we have developed a computer-aided algorithm that monitors optical changes in the device and adjusts the applied voltage in accordance with the phase transformation process, thereby significantly enhancing the lifetime of these reconfigurable devices. Our findings reveal that patterned PCM structures show significantly higher endurance compared to blanket PCM thin films.</description>

      <title>Large-scale photonic chip based pulse interleaver for low-noise microwave generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwaves generated by optical techniques have demonstrated unprecedentedly low noise and hold significance in various applications such as communication, radar, instrumentation, and metrology. To date, the purest microwave signals are generated using optical frequency division with femtosecond mode-locked lasers. However, many femtosecond laser combs have a radio frequency (RF) repetition rate in the hundreds of megahertz range, necessitating methods to translate the generated low-noise RF signal to the microwave domain. Benchtop pulse interleavers can multiply the pulse repetition rate, avoid saturation of photodetectors, and facilitate the generation of high-power low-noise microwave signals, which have to date only been demonstrated using optical fibers or free space optics. Here, we introduce a large-scale photonic integrated circuit-based interleaver, offering size reduction and enhanced stability. The all-on-chip interleaver attains a 64-fold multiplication of the repetition rate, directly translated from 216 MHz to 14 GHz in microwave Ku-Band. By overcoming photodetector saturation, the generated microwave power was improved by 36 dB, with a phase noise floor reduced by more than 10 folds to -160 dBc/Hz on the 14 GHz carrier. The device is based on a low-loss and high-density photonic integrated circuit fabricated by the photonic Damascene process. Six cascaded stages of Mach-Zehnder interferometers with optical delay lines up to 33 centimeters long are fully integrated into a compact footprint of 8.5 mmx1.7 mm. The lithographically defined precision of the optical waveguide path length enables the scaling up of the interleaved frequency to millimeter-wave bands, which is challenging the fiber-based counterparts. This interleaver has the potential to reduce the cost and footprint of mode-locked-laser-based microwave generation, allowing for field deployment.</description>

      <title>Vortex nonlinear optics in monolayer van der Waals crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to wavelength and polarization, coherent light possesses a degree of freedom associated with its spatial topology that, when exploited through nonlinear optics, can unlock a plethora of new photonic phenomena. A prime example involves the use of vortex beams, which allow for the tuning of light's orbital angular momentum (OAM) on demand. Such processes can not only reveal emergent physics but also enable high-density classical and quantum communication paradigms by allowing access to an infinitely large set of orthogonal optical states. Nevertheless, structured nonlinear optics have failed to keep pace with the ever-present need to shrink the length-scale of optoelectronic and photonic technologies to the nanoscale regime. Here, we push the boundaries of vortex nonlinear optics to the ultimate limits of material dimensionality. By exploiting second and third-order nonlinear frequency-mixing processes in van der Waals semiconductor monolayers, we show the free manipulation of the wavelength, topological charge, and radial index of vortex light-fields. We demonstrate that such control can be supported over a broad spectral bandwidth, unconstrained by traditional limits associated with bulk nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, due to the atomically-thin nature of the host crystal. Our work breaks through traditional constraints in optics and promises to herald a new avenue for next-generation optoelectronic and photonics technologies empowered by twisted nanoscale nonlinear light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic sapphire optical reference cavity with crystalline coatings at $\mathrm{ 1 \times 10^{-16}}$ fractional instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency stability of a laser locked to an optical reference cavity is fundamentally limited by thermal noise in the cavity length. These fluctuations are linked to material dissipation, which depends both on the temperature of the optical components and the material properties. Here, the design and experimental characterization of a sapphire optical cavity operated at 10 K with crystalline coatings at 1069 nm is presented. Theoretical estimates of the thermo-mechanical noise indicate a thermal noise floor below $\mathrm{4.5\times10^{-18}}$. Major technical noise contributions including vibrations, temperature fluctuations, and residual amplitude modulation are characterized in detail. The short-term performance is measured via a three-cornered hat analysis with two other cavity-stabilized lasers, yielding a noise floor of $1\times10^{-16}$. The long-term performance is measured against an optical lattice clock, indicating cavity stability at the level of $2\times10^{-15}$ for averaging times up to 10,000 s.</description>

      <title>New point of view about optical activity in helically-coiled fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical activity in a helically-coiled optical fiber is reexamined. It is proven that not only is there no circular birefringence in the fiber but the polarization relative to the laboratory reference frame is not rotated along the fiber. The reason for this is that in contrast with the polarization vector, the Jones vector does not give a complete description of the polarization. As a mathematical entity in some local reference frame that depends on the instantaneous propagation direction, it can only describe the state of polarization relative to that reference frame. With the new implication of the Jones vector, the results of the experiment reported by Papp and Harms in 1977 are explained satisfactorily. In particular, it is shown that the state of polarization relative to the Tang frame remains unchanged along the fiber. The optical activity appears only relative to the Serret-Frenet frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) provides detailed information about molecular interactions and biological processes. A major bottleneck for FLIM is image resolution at high acquisition speeds, due to the engineering and signal-processing limitations of time-resolved imaging technology. Here we present single-sample image-fusion upsampling (SiSIFUS), a data-fusion approach to computational FLIM super-resolution that combines measurements from a low-resolution time-resolved detector (that measures photon arrival time) and a high-resolution camera (that measures intensity only). To solve this otherwise ill-posed inverse retrieval problem, we introduce statistically informed priors that encode local and global dependencies between the two single-sample measurements. This bypasses the risk of out-of-distribution hallucination as in traditional data-driven approaches and delivers enhanced images compared for example to standard bilinear interpolation. The general approach laid out by SiSIFUS can be applied to other image super-resolution problems where two different datasets are available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquity of optical coherence arising from its importance in everything from astronomy to photovoltaics means that underlying assumptions such as stationarity and ergodicity can become implicit. When these assumptions become implicit, it can appear that two different averages are independent: the finite time averaging of a detector and the ensemble average of the optical field over multiple detections. One of the two types of averaging may even be ignored. We can observe coherence as an interference fringe pattern and learn properties of the field through both methods of averaging but the coherence will not be the same, as demonstrated by the Magyar and Mandel-Wolf paradox.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous action of a single photon at two remote places</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

Abstract: Hydrodynamic plasma waveguides initiated by optical field ionization (OFI) have recently become a key component of multi-GeV laser wakefield accelerators. Here, we present the most complete and accurate experimental and simulation-based characterization to date, applicable both to current multi-GeV experiments and future 100 GeV-scale laser plasma accelerators. Crucial to the simulations is the correct modeling of intense Bessel beam interaction with meter-scale gas targets, the results of which are used as initial conditions for hydrodynamic simulations. The simulations are in good agreement with our experiments measuring evolving plasma and neutral hydrogen density profiles using two-color short pulse interferometry, enabling realistic determination of the guided mode structure for application to laser-driven plasma accelerator design.</description>

      <title>Mapping Phonon Polaritons with Visible Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) are hybrid photon-phonon waves which enable strong light-matter interactions and subdiffractional confinement, potentially empowering applications in sensing, nonlinear optics and nanoscale energy manipulation. In this work, we use confocal Raman microscopy to investigate the coupling between bulk phonon modes and localized surface phonon polariton (SPhP) modes in indium phosphide (InP) nanopillars and 4H-silicon carbide (4H-SiC) gratings. The Raman intensity within the nanostructures is described in terms of the SPhP eigenmodes and used to reconstruct the field intensity, providing a method to map SPhP eigenmodes using visible and near-IR light. Our results indicate that, contrary to expectation, all Raman-active bulk phonon modes of InP and 4H-SiC couple to the localized SPhP modes. Further, we confirm that polarizability selection rules form the predominant coupling mechanism between phonons and SPhP modes, with electron-phonon coupling playing a role for certain phonon modes (A1(LO) and E1(TO) in 4H-SiC). These observations provide a method for extending Raman studies of PhP modes to achieve full 3D reconstruction of the PhP eigenmodes and visualize light-matter interactions within nanostructures, thus advancing Raman scattering as a technique for understanding PhP modes.</description>

Abstract: Similarity between Walker and Helmholtz equations encouraged many to search for analogies between optical and spin wave phenomena. In the present article we demonstrate that one to one relationship can be established by formalizing the concept of magnetic refractive index and deriving on its basis Eikonal equations for magnetic media, formally proving that a very substantial portion of optical devices: lenses, mirrors, waveguides and so on, can be implemented as magnetic devices operating on spin waves instead of optical radiation. Controlling the refractive index is accomplished by changing the environmental variables such as magnetic bias field or temperature. Functionality of the above mentioned devices is confirmed with micromagnetic simulations, which also demonstrate a substantial agreement with the analytical model introduced in the present manuscript.</description>

Abstract: Highly pure and indistinguishable photons are a prerequisite for use in quantum information processing. We introduce protocols for the distillation of indistinguishable photons that offer a significant improvement over previous work, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, with resource requirements scaling linearly in $n$. We present the protocols, based on the discrete Fourier transform and Hadamard (Sylvester) matrices, then give both analytical and numerical results regarding their performance. We observe that the same symmetry properties governing suppression laws are instrumental in understanding the behavior of these distillation protocols. We also prove, adapting a result from the Hadamard case, that for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform with $n$ a prime power, the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law based on permutation symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a sensitive optically-pumped magnetometer using rubidium vapor and 0.75 amg of nitrogen buffer gas in a sub-mm-width sensing channel excavated by femtosecond laser writing followed by chemical etching. The channel is buried less than 1 mm below the surface of its fused silica host material, which also includes reservoir chambers and micro-strainer connections, to preserve a clean optical environment. Using a zero-field-resonance magnetometry strategy and a sensing volume of 2.25 mm$^3$, we demonstrate a sensitivity of $\approx$ 1 $\mathrm{pT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $10$ Hz. The device can be integrated with photonic structures and microfluidic channels with 3D versatility. Its sensitivity, bandwidth and stand-off distance will enable detection of localized fields from magnetic nanoparticles and \mul NMR samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically describe and experimentally demonstrate a graphene-integrated metasurface structure that enables electrically-tunable directional control of thermal emission. This device consists of a dielectric slab that acts as a Fabry-Perot (F-P) resonator supporting long-range delocalized modes bounded on one side by an electrostatically tunable metal-graphene metasurface. By varying the Fermi level of the graphene, the accumulated phase of the F-P mode is shifted, which changes the direction of absorption and emission at a fixed frequency. We directly measure the frequency- and angle-dependent emissivity of the thermal emission from a fabricated device heated to 250$^{\circ}$. Our results show that electrostatic control allows the thermal emission at 6.61 $\mu$m to be continuously steered over 16$^{\circ}$, with a peak emissivity maintained above 0.9. We analyze the dynamic behavior of the thermal emission steerer theoretically using a Fano interference model, and use the model to design optimized thermal steerer structures.</description>

Abstract: The usage of a GaAsP (gallium arsenide phosphide) photomultiplier for microscopical imaging allows the evaluation of low-light luminescent objects. We designed a setup for collecting a confocal microscopic image signal, which is divided into 14 equal-sized input channels. The division is achieved with a beamsplitter and two fiber bundles consisting of seven fibers each. Re-imaging the confocal pinhole by such a densely packed fiber bundle permits the utilization of a photon re-localization approach to overcome the optical resolution limit. The center fiber creates a real-time image, while the outer fibers enable a higher-resolution image via an image scanning microscope (ISM) signal calculation. The fiber bundles are enclosed in a fused silica capillary and are drawn out to create one solid fiber bundle. During the drawing process, the fiber bundles are tapered down to an outer diameter size of 400 {\mu}m, with each fiber having a less than 0.3 Airy unit diameter. For the photomultiplier interface, all fibers of both fiber bundles are integrated into a v-groove array, with each fiber representing a detection input, which is followed by projection optics for imaging onto the multichannel detector. The resulting confocal super-resolution microscope is suitable for the application of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) techniques such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), time-resolved anisotropy, or F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging.</description>

      <title>Perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination -- how far is the radiative limit?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report an experimental demonstration of perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination and critically analyse their performance against radiative limits. To this end, we first establish a set of quantitative benchmark characteristics expected from solar cells limited by bimolecular recombination. Transient as well as steady state intensity dependent measurements indicate that our solar cells indeed operate at such limits with interface passivation comparable to the champion c-Si technology. Further, we identify novel characterization schemes which enable consistent back extraction of recombination parameters from transient optoelectrical and electroluminescence measurements. Remarkably, these parameters predict important features of dark current density vs. voltage characteristics (J-V) and Suns-V_OC measurements, thus validating the estimates and the methodology. Uniquely, this work provides a consistent and coherent interpretation of diverse experimental trends ranging from dark J-V, Suns-V_OC, steady state and transient intensity dependent measurements to electroluminescence quantum yield. As such, insights shared in this manuscript could have significant implications towards fundamental electronic processes in perovskite solar cells and further efficiency optimization towards Shockley-Queisser limits.</description>

      <title>Theory of angular momentum transfer from light to molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory describing interaction of structured light, such as light carrying orbital angular momentum, with molecules. The light-matter interaction Hamiltonian we derive is expressed through couplings between spherical gradients of the electric field and the (transition) multipole moments of a particle of any non-trivial rotation point group. Our model can therefore accommodate for an arbitrary complexity of the molecular and electric field structure, and can be straightforwardly extended to atoms or nanostructures. Applying this framework to ro-vibrational spectroscopy of molecules, we uncover the general mechanism of angular momentum exchange between the spin and orbital angular momenta of light, molecular rotation and its center-of-mass motion. We show that the non-zero vorticity of Laguerre-Gaussian beams can strongly enhance certain ro-vibrational transitions that are considered forbidden in the case of non-helical light. We discuss the experimental requirements for the observation of these forbidden transitions in state-of-the-art spatially-resolved spectroscopy measurements.</description>

      <title>Interferometric sorting of temporal Hermite-Gauss modes via temporal Gouy phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a device consisting of $m$ Mach-Zehnder interferometers and realizing sorting of first $2^m$ temporal Hermite-Gauss modes of light passing though it by adjusting the accumulated temporal Gouy phase acquired by every mode. This mode-order-dependent phase shift is achieved by a fractional Fourier transform realized by a time lens in one of interferometer's arms. We consider application of such a sorter with just two interferometers to sorting the Schmidt modes of a photon pair generated in spontaneous parametric downconversion and find the theoretical lower bond on the cross-talk probability of 5.5%.</description>

      <title>Topological States Decorated by Twig Boundary in Plasma Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The twig edge states in graphene-like structures are viewed as the fourth states complementary to their zigzag, bearded, and armchair counterparts. In this work, we study a rod-in-plasma system in honeycomb lattice with twig edge truncation under external magnetic fields and lattice scaling and show that twig edge states can exist in different phases of the system, such as quantum Hall phase, quantum spin Hall phase and insulating phase. The twig edge states in the negative permittivity background exhibit robust one-way transmission property immune to backscattering and thus provide a novel avenue for solving the plasma communication blackout problem. Moreover, we demonstrate that corner and edge states can exist within the shrunken structure by modulating the on-site potential of the twig edges. Especially, helical edge states with the unique feature of pseudospin-momentum locking that could be excited by chiral sources are demonstrated at the twig edges. Our results show that the twig edges and interface engineering can bring new opportunities for more flexible manipulation of electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry in a system without periodic external driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking can occur in systems periodically driven at a certain period. We predict a spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry in an atom-cavity system without external driving, in which a time scale is determined by the time of light bypass of the resonator. We demonstrate that there is a parameter range, in which a system state returns to its initial state only after two bypasses of the resonator. We believe that the predicted phenomenon opens a way to a new direction in the time crystal field.</description>
