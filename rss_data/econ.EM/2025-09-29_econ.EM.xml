      <title>Direct Bias-Correction Term Estimation for Propensity Scores and Average Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study considers the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE). For ATE estimation, we estimate the propensity score through direct bias-correction term estimation. Let $\{(X_i, D_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the observations, where $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denotes $p$-dimensional covariates, $D_i \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes a binary treatment assignment indicator, and $Y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is an outcome. In ATE estimation, the bias-correction term $h_0(X_i, D_i) = \frac{1[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \frac{1[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$ plays an important role, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score, the probability of being assigned treatment $1$. In this study, we propose estimating $h_0$ (or equivalently the propensity score $e_0$) by directly minimizing the prediction error of $h_0$. Since the bias-correction term $h_0$ is essential for ATE estimation, this direct approach is expected to improve estimation accuracy for the ATE. For example, existing studies often employ maximum likelihood or covariate balancing to estimate $e_0$, but these approaches may not be optimal for accurately estimating $h_0$ or the ATE. We present a general framework for this direct bias-correction term estimation approach from the perspective of Bregman divergence minimization and conduct simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Climate change: across time and frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet tools to characterize the dynamics of climate change across time and frequencies. This approach allows us to capture the changing patterns in the relationship between global mean temperature anomalies and climate forcings. Using historical data from 1850 to 2022, we find that greenhouse gases, and CO$_2$ in particular, play a significant role in driving the very low frequency trending behaviour in temperatures, even after controlling for the effects of natural forcings. At shorter frequencies, the effect of forcings on temperatures switches on and off, most likely because of complex feedback mechanisms in Earth's climate system.</description>

      <title>The Identification Power of Combining Experimental and Observational Data for Distributional Treatment Effect Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the identification power gained by combining experimental data in which treatment is randomized with observational data in which treatment is self-selected for distributional treatment effect (DTE) parameters. While experimental data identify average treatment effects, many DTE parameters such as the distribution of individual treatment effects are only partially identified. We examine whether and how combining these two data sources tightens the identified set for such parameters. For broad classes of DTE parameters, we derive sharp bounds under the combined data and clarify the mechanism through which data combination improves identification relative to using experimental data alone. Our analysis highlights that the self-selection in observational data is a key source of identification power. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which the combined data shrink the identified set, showing that such shrinkage generally occurs unless selection-on-observables holds in the observational data. We also propose a linear programming approach to compute sharp bounds that can incorporate additional structural restrictions, such as positive dependence between potential outcomes and the generalized Roy model. An empirical application using data on negative campaign advertisements in the U.S. presidential election illustrates the practical relevance of the proposed approach.</description>
