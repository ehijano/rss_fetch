      <title>Generic data reduction for nulling interferometry package: the grip of a single data reduction package on all the nulling interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nulling interferometry is a powerful observing technique to reach exoplanets and circumstellar dust at separations too small for direct imaging with single-dish telescopes and too large for indirect methods. With near-future instrumentation, it bears the potential to detect young, hot planets near the snow lines of their host stars. A future space mission could detect and characterize a large number of rocky, habitable-zone planets around nearby stars at thermal-infrared wavelengths. The null self-calibration is a method aiming at modelling the statistical distribution of the nulled signal. It has proven to be more sensitive and accurate than average-based data reduction methods in nulling interferometry. This statistical approach opens the possibility of designing a GPU-based Python package to reduce the data from any of these instruments, by simply providing the data and a simulator of the instrument. GRIP is a toolbox to reduce nulling and interferometric data based on the statistical self-calibration method. In this article, we present the main features of GRIP as well as applications on real data.</description>

      <title>Design and characterization of a 60-cm reflective half-wave plate for the CLASS 90 GHz band telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Front-end polarization modulation enables improved polarization measurement stability by modulating the targeted signal above the low-frequency $1/f$ drifts associated with atmospheric and instrumental instabilities and diminishes the impact of instrumental polarization. In this work, we present the design and characterization of a new 60-cm diameter Reflective Half-Wave Plate (RHWP) polarization modulator for the 90 GHz band telescope of the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) project. The RHWP consists of an array of parallel wires (diameter $50~\mathrm{\mu m}$, $175~\mathrm{\mu m}$ pitch) positioned $0.88~\mathrm{mm}$ from an aluminum mirror. In lab tests, it was confirmed that the wire resonance frequency ($f_\mathrm{res}$) profile is consistent with the target, $139~\mathrm{Hz}&lt;f_\mathrm{res}&lt;154~\mathrm{Hz}$ in the optically active region (diameter smaller than $150~\mathrm{mm}$), preventing the wire vibration during operation and reducing the RHWP deformation under the wire tension. The mirror tilt relative to the rotating axis was controlled to be $&lt;15''$, corresponding to an increase in beam width due to beam smearing of $&lt;0.6''$, negligible compared to the beam's full-width half-maximum of $36'$. The median and 16/84th percentile of the wire--mirror separation residual was $0.048^{+0.013}_{-0.014}~\mathrm{mm}$ in the optically active region, achieving a modulation efficiency $\epsilon=96.2_{+0.5}^{-0.4}\%$ with an estimated bandpass of 34 GHz. The angular velocity of the RHWP was maintained to an accuracy of within $0.005\%$ at the nominal rotation frequency ($2.5~\mathrm{Hz}$). The RHWP has been successfully integrated into the CLASS 90 GHz telescope and started taking data in June 2024, replacing the previous modulator that has been in operation since June 2018.</description>

      <title>The MICADO first light imager for the ELT: the PSF Reconstruction Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MICADO is the first-light camera of the ESO ELT, allowing NIR imaging and long-slit spectroscopy assisted by adaptive optics. MICADO is now entering its construction phase, and the software for data reduction is reaching an adequate maturity level. The PSF Reconstruction (PSF-R) of MICADO is a software tool for the blind derivation of the PSF, only using adaptive optics telemetry data. An update of the status of the PSF-R service is provided here. The PSF-R prototype has been tested on ERIS@VLT data in order to check the reconstruction of on- and off-axis PSFs. The on-axis PSF-R is accurate at a few percent level on Strehl, FWHM, Encircled Energy, and half light radius, while for the off-axis case the match is within 10-15 percent at a distance of half isoplanatic angle. The first version of the workflow for the PSF-R pipeline has been developed and verified using the latest release of the ESO data processing system. A set of simulations has been implemented on the morphological analysis of distant galaxies, showing that the accuracy of the PSF-R matches the goals needed to study their morphology. In summary, the PSF-R team is on the right track towards the ELT first light.</description>

      <title>A numerical simulation study of an astrometry case for MORFEO at the ELT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from numerical simulations assessing astrometry measurements with the Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics Relay for ELT Observations (MORFEO) instrument on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Using the Advanced Exposure Time Calculator (AETC), we evaluate MORFEO astrometric accuracy in moderately crowded fields. Our simulations account for spatially variable Point Spread Function (PSF), geometric distortion, and rotation-dependent variations. We computed focal plane coordinates using observed stellar distribution and computed population synthesis with the SPISEA tool, generating stellar magnitude distributions for MICADO filters at selected metallicities and stellar ages. Our analysis shows that MORFEO can achieve high-precision astrometry in the galaxy neighborhood (within $\mu &lt; 24$ mag) by minimizing PSF enlargement and optimizing calibration strategies. These results inform future observational campaigns and contribute to the development of astrometric science cases for the ELT.</description>

      <title>FlyEye Ground-Based Telescope: Unveiling New Frontiers in Astronomical Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FlyEye design makes its debut in the ESA's NEOSTEL developed by OHB-Italia. This pioneering FlyEye telescope integrates a monolithic 1-meter class primary mirror feeding 16 CCD cameras for discovering Near-Earth Object (NEO) and any class of transient phenomena. OHB-Italia is the prime contractor, receiving extended support from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) in the ESA's NEOSTED program's integration and testing. The FlyEye distinctive design splits the Field of View into 16 channels, creating a unique multi-telescope system with a panoramic 44 square degree Field of View and a seeing-size pixel-scale, enabling NEOs detection down to apparent magnitudes 21.5 insisting on a 1m diameter spherical mirror. The scientific products of a similar FlyEye telescope can complement facilities such as Vera Rubin (former LSST) and ZTF. The FlyEye has the ability to survey two-thirds of the visible sky about three times per night can revolutionize time-domain astronomy, enabling comprehensive studies of transient phenomena, placing FlyEye in a new era of exploration of the dynamic universe. Efforts to develop automated calibration and testing procedures are keys to realizing this transformative potential.</description>

      <title>Silicon drift detectors for the Spectroscopy Focusing Array of eXTP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a silicon drift detector (SDD) system for the spectroscopy focusing array (SFA) of the enhanced X-ray timing and polarimetry (eXTP) mission. The SFA focuses on fast timing (time resolution below 10 {\mu}s) and good spectroscopy capabilities (energy resolution better than 180 eV @ 6 keV). The sensor, consisting of 19 hexagonally shaped pixels with a total sensitive area of ${5.05}\, cm^{2}$, is connected to three high time resolution spectroscopy (HTRS) ASICs, allowing a fast readout of the detector signals. The detector works in a Charge- Sensitive Amplifier configuration. We assembled a prototype detector module and present here its mechanical design, describe the used sensor, and report about its performance.</description>

      <title>The MICADO first light imager for the ELT: off-axis performance of PSF reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highest scientific return, for adaptive optics (AO) observations, is achieved with a reliable reconstruction of the PSF. This is especially true for MICADO@ELT. In this presentation, we will focus on extending the MICADO PSF reconstruction (PSF-R) method to the off-axis case. Specifically, a novel approach based on temporal-based tomography of AO telemetry data has been recently implemented. Results from the PSF-R of both simulated and real data show that, at half isoplanatic angle distances, a precision of about 10-15% is achievable in both Strehl ratio and full-width at half maximum, paving the way to extend the MICADO PSF-R tool also to the multi-conjugated AO case.</description>

      <title>Searching for Protoplanets around MWC 758 and MWC 480 in Br-$\gamma$ using Kernel Phase and SCExAO/CHARIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering new actively-accreting protoplanets is crucial to answering open questions about planet formation. However, identifying such planets at orbital distances where they are expected to be abundant is extremely challenging, both due to the technical requirements and large distances to star-forming regions. Here we use the kernel phase interferometry (KPI) technique to search for companions around the $\sim$6 and $\sim$8 Myr old Herbig Ae stars MWC 758 and MWC 480. KPI is a data analysis technique which is sensitive to moderate asymmetries, arising from eg. a circumstellar disk or companions with contrasts of up to 6-8 mags, at separations down to and even below the classical Rayleigh diffraction limit ($\sim 1.2\lambda / D$). Using the high spectral resolution K-band mode of the SCExAO/CHARIS integral field spectrograph, we search for both excess Br-$\gamma$ line emission and continuum emission from companions around MWC 480 and MWC 758. We are able to set limits on the presence of rapidly accreting protoplanets and brown dwarfs between 4 and 16 au, well interior to those of previous studies. In Br-$\gamma$, we set limits on excess line emission equivalent to accretion rates ranging from $10^{-5} M_{j}^{2}.yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}M_{j}^{2}.yr^{-1}$. Our achievable contrasts demonstrate that KPI using SCExAO/CHARIS is a promising technique to search for giant accreting protoplanets at smaller separations compared to conventional imaging.</description>

      <title>The Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) is a solar-gazing spectrograph scheduled to fly in the summer of 2025 on a NASA sounding rocket. Its goal is to view the solar chromosphere and transition region at a high cadence (1s) both spatially (0.5") and spectrally (33 m{\AA}) viewing wavelengths around Lyman Alpha (1216 {\AA}), Si iii (1206 {\AA}) and O v (1218 {\AA}) to observe spicules, nanoflares, and possibly a solar flare. This time cadence will provide yet-unobserved detail about fast-changing features of the Sun. The instrument is comprised of a Gregorian-style reflecting telescope combined with a spectrograph via a specialized mirrorlet array that focuses the light from each spatial location in the image so that it may be spectrally dispersed without overlap from neighboring locations. This paper discusses the driving science, detailed instrument and subsystem design, and pre-integration testing of the SNIFS instrument.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale gridded Gabor attention for cirrus segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of segmenting global contaminants in large images. The precise delineation of such structures requires ample global context alongside understanding of textural patterns. CNNs specialise in the latter, though their ability to generate global features is limited. Attention measures long range dependencies in images, capturing global context, though at a large computational cost. We propose a gridded attention mechanism to address this limitation, greatly increasing efficiency by processing multi-scale features into smaller tiles. We also enhance the attention mechanism for increased sensitivity to texture orientation, by measuring correlations across features dependent on different orientations, in addition to channel and positional attention. We present results on a new dataset of astronomical images, where the task is segmenting large contaminating dust clouds.</description>

      <title>The effect of spectroscopic binning on atmospheric retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offering higher resolution data in space-based transmission spectroscopy, understanding the capabilities of our current atmospheric retrieval pipelines is essential. These new data cover wider wavelength ranges and at much higher spectral resolution than previous instruments have been able to offer. Therefore, it is often appealing to bin spectra to fewer points, better constrained in their transit depth, before using them as inputs for atmospheric retrievals. However, little quantitative analysis of the trade-off between spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio has been conducted thus far. As such, we produce a simulation replicating the observations of WASP-39b by the NIRSpec PRISM instrument on board JWST and assess the accuracy and consistency of retrievals while varying resolution and the average photometric error. While this probes a specific case we also plot `binning paths' in the resulting sensitivity maps to demonstrate the best attainable atmospheric parameter estimations starting from the position of the real JWST Early Release Science observation. We repeat this analysis on three different simulation setups where each includes an opaque cloud layer at a different height in the atmosphere. We find that a much greater resolution is needed in the case of a high cloud deck since features are already heavily muted by the presence of the clouds. In the other two cases, there are large `safe zones' in the parameter space. If these maps can be generalised, binning paths could inform future observations on how to achieve the most accurate retrieval results.</description>

      <title>A grid of self-consistent MSG (MARCS-StaticWeather-GGchem) cool stellar, sub-stellar, and exoplanetary model atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computation of a grid of self consistent 1D model atmospheres of cool stars, sub-stellar objects and exoplanets in the effective temperature range 300K to 3000K, including cloud formation, chemical non-equilibrium effects, and stellar irradiation.
  The models are called MSG, because they are based on an iterative coupling between three well tested codes, the MARCS stellar atmosphere code, the StaticWeather cloud formation code and the GGchem chemical equilibrium code. It includes up-to-date molecular and atomic opacities, cloud formation and advanced chemical equilibrium calculations, and involves new numerical methods at low temperatures to allow robust convergence.
  The coupling between the MARCS radiative transfer and GGchem chemical equilibrium computations has made it possibly effectively to reach convergence based on electron pressure for the warmer models and gas pressure for the cooler models, enabling self-consistent modelling of stellar, sub-stellar and exoplanetary objects in a very wide range of effective temperatures. Here we describe the basic details of the models, with illustrative examples of cloudy and irradiated models as well as models based on non-equilibrium chemistry.
  The qualitative changes in the relative abundances of TiO, H2O, CH4, NH3, and other molecules in our models follow the observationally defined M, L, T (and Y) sequences, but reveal more complex and depth dependent abundance changes, and therefore a spectral classification depending on more parameters. The self consistent coupling to Static-Weather cloud computations, allows detailed comparison between nucleation and observed relative dimming of different spectral bands, with advanced applications for new identification methods of potential exoplanetary biology.</description>

      <title>PyMerger: Detecting Binary Black Hole merger from Einstein Telescope Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PyMerger, a Python tool for detecting binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the Einstein Telescope (ET), based on a Deep Residual Neural Network model (ResNet). ResNet was trained on data combined from all three proposed sub-detectors of ET (TSDCD) to detect BBH mergers. Five different lower frequency cutoffs ($F_{\text{low}}$): 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 15 Hz, 20 Hz, and 30 Hz, with match-filter Signal-to-Noise Ratio ($MSNR$) ranges: 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, and &gt;8, were employed in the data simulation. Compared to previous work that utilized data from single sub-detector data (SSDD), the detection accuracy from TSDCD has shown substantial improvements, increasing from $60\%$, $60.5\%$, $84.5\%$, $94.5\%$ to $78.5\%$, $84\%$, $99.5\%$, $100\%$, and $100\%$ for sources with $MSNR$ of 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, and &gt;8, respectively. The ResNet model was evaluated on the first Einstein Telescope mock Data Challenge (ET-MDC1) dataset, where the model demonstrated strong performance in detecting BBH mergers, identifying 5,566 out of 6,578 BBH events, with optimal SNR starting from 1.2, and a minimum and maximum $D_{L}$ of 0.5 Gpc and 148.95 Gpc, respectively. Despite being trained only on BBH mergers without overlapping sources, the model achieved high BBH detection rates. Notably, even though the model was not trained on BNS and BHNS mergers, it successfully detected 11,477 BNS and 323 BHNS mergers in ET-MDC1, with optimal SNR starting from 0.2 and 1, respectively, indicating its potential for broader applicability.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale stellar surveys, such as SDSS-V, 4MOST, WEAVE, and PLATO, require accurate atmospheric models and synthetic spectra of stars for accurate analyses of fundamental stellar parameters and chemical abundances. The primary goal of our work is to develop a new approach to solve radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) and generate model stellar spectra in a self-consistent and highly efficient framework. We build upon the Copenhagen legacy RHD code, the MULTI3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) code, and the DISPATCH high-performance framework. The new approach allows us to calculate 3D RHD models of stellar atmospheres on timescales of a few thousand CPU hours and to perform subsequent spectrum synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or NLTE for the desired physical conditions within the parameter space of FGK-type stars. We compare the 3D RHD solar model with other available models and validate its performance against solar observations, including the centre-to-limb variation of intensities and key solar diagnostic lines of H and Fe. We show that the performance of the new code allows to overcome the main bottleneck in 3D NLTE spectroscopy and enables calculations of multi-dimensional grids of synthetic stellar observables for comparison with modern astronomical observations.</description>
