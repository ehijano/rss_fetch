      <title>The effect of finite mass in cavity QED calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of finite nuclear mass is investigated in coupled light matter systems in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) using the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian. Three different systems, the He atom, the H$^-$ ion and the H$_2^+$ ion is investigated. There are small, but significant differences in the behavior of the binding energies as the function of the coupling strength. The probability of coupling to light is found to be very small but even this small coupling has a very strong effect on the energies of the systems.</description>

      <title>Path-ordered linked product approximation to the global electronic overlap matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global many-electron wave function overlap matrix accounts for all effects beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in the discrete variable local diabatic representation, a numerically exact framework for modeling nonadiabatic conical intersection wave packet dynamics. Nevertheless, calculating the electronic overlap matrix from electronic structure is computationally expensive. Here, we introduce an approximation for constructing the electronic overlap matrix between any two long-range geometries by the product of nearest-neighbor overlap matrices along a path connecting these two geometries. This approximation significantly reduces the computational effort by only requiring electronic structure calculations for the nearest-neighbor overlap matrices. The accuracy of this approximation is demonstrated through an exact simulation of a proton-coupled electron transfer model. Our results show that although the approximate overlap matrix can exhibit noticeable differences from the exact ones, the conical intersection dynamics is in almost exact agreement with those from the exact overlap matrix.</description>

      <title>Tomographic identification of all molecular orbitals in a wide binding energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, photoemission orbital tomography (POT) has evolved into a powerful tool to investigate the electronic structure of organic molecules adsorbed on surfaces. Here we show that POT allows for the comprehensive experimental identification of all molecular orbitals in a substantial binding energy range, in the present case more than 10 eV. Making use of the angular distribution of photoelectrons as a function of binding energy, we exemplify this by extracting orbital-resolved partial densities of states (pDOS) for 15 $\pi$ and 23 $\sigma$ orbitals from the experimental photoemission intensities of the prototypical organic molecule bisanthene (C$_{28}$H$_{14}$) on a Cu(110) surface. In their entirety, these experimentally measured orbital-resolved pDOS for an essentially complete set of orbitals serve as a stringent benchmark for electronic structure methods, which we illustrate by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing four frequently-used exchange-correlation functionals. By computing the respective molecular-orbital-projected densities of states of the bisanthene/Cu(110) interface, a one-to-one comparison with experimental data for an unprecedented number of 38 orbital energies becomes possible. The quantitative analysis of our data reveals that the range-separated hybrid functional HSE performs best for the investigated organic/metal interface. At a more fundamental level, the remarkable agreement between the experimental and the Kohn-Sham orbital energies over a binding energy range larger than 10\,eV suggests that -- perhaps unexpectedly -- Kohn-Sham orbitals approximate Dyson orbitals, which would rigorously account for the electron extraction process in photoemission spectroscopy but are notoriously difficult to compute, in a much better way than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Modelling complex proton transport phenomena -- Exploring the limits of fine-tuning and transferability of foundational machine-learned force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solid acids CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and Cs$_7$(H$_4$PO$_4$)(H$_2$PO$_4$)$_8$ pose significant challenges for the simulation of proton transport phenomena. In this work, we use the recently developed machine-learned force field (MLFF) MACE to model the proton dynamics on nanosecond time scales for these systems and compare its performance with long-term ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The MACE-MP-0 foundation model shows remarkable performance for all observables derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, but minor quantitative discrepancies remain compared to the AIMD reference data. However, we show that minimal fine-tuning -- fitting to as little as 1 ps of AIMD data -- leads to full quantitative agreement between the radial distribution functions of MACE force field and AIMD simulations. In addition, we show that traditional long-term AIMD simulations fail to capture the correct qualitative trends in diffusion coefficients and activation energies for these solid acids due to the limited accessible time scale. In contrast, accurate and convergent diffusion coefficients can be reliably obtained through multi-nanosecond long MD simulations using machine-learned force fields. The obtained qualitative and quantitative behavior of the converged diffusion coefficients and activation energies now matches the experimental trends for both solid acids, in contrast to previous AIMD simulations that yielded a qualitatively wrong picture.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper, we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle and substrate wettability on evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.</description>

      <title>EquiBoost: An Equivariant Boosting Approach to Molecular Conformation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular conformation generation plays key roles in computational drug design. Recently developed deep learning methods, particularly diffusion models have reached competitive performance over traditional cheminformatical approaches. However, these methods are often time-consuming or require extra support from traditional methods. We propose EquiBoost, a boosting model that stacks several equivariant graph transformers as weak learners, to iteratively refine 3D conformations of molecules. Without relying on diffusion techniques, EquiBoost balances accuracy and efficiency more effectively than diffusion-based methods. Notably, compared to the previous state-of-the-art diffusion method, EquiBoost improves generation quality and preserves diversity, achieving considerably better precision of Average Minimum RMSD (AMR) on the GEOM datasets. This work rejuvenates boosting and sheds light on its potential to be a robust alternative to diffusion models in certain scenarios.</description>

      <title>Providing Machine Learning Potentials with High Quality Uncertainty Estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational chemistry has come a long way over the course of several decades, enabling subatomic level calculations particularly with the development of Density Functional Theory (DFT). Recently, machine-learned potentials (MLP) have provided a way to overcome the prevalent time and length scale constraints in such calculations. Unfortunately, these models utilise complex and high dimensional representations, making it challenging for users to intuit performance from chemical structure, which has motivated the development of methods for uncertainty quantification. One of the most common methods is to introduce an ensemble of models and employ an averaging approach to determine the uncertainty. In this work, we introduced Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for uncertainty aware energy evaluation as a more principled and resource efficient method to achieve this goal. The richness of our uncertainty quantification enables a new type of hybrid workflow where calculations can be offloaded to a MLP in a principled manner.</description>

Abstract: The double minimum E$^1\Sigma^{+}_{\mathrm{u}}$ state in caesium dimer was investigated by analysing spectra of the E$^1\Sigma^{+}_{\mathrm{u}}$ $\leftarrow$ X$^1\Sigma^{+}_{\mathrm{g}}$ band system, simplified by polarisation labelling. A total of 6727 rotationally resolved transitions to levels situated in the inner well and above the internal barrier were identified and a potential energy curve allowing to reproduce their energies was constructed using the Fourier grid Hamiltonian and inverted perturbation approach methods. The unambiguousness of the potential curve in view of lack of data related to levels located in the outer well is discussed.</description>

      <title>MoSi2N4-like crystals -- the new family of two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently-synthesised MoSi2N4 is the first septuple layer two-dimensional material, which doesn't naturally occurs as a layered crystal, and has been obtained with CVD growth. It can be considered as MoN2 crystal (with a crystal structure of MoS2) intercalating Si2N2 two-dimensional layer (with the structure similar to InSe). Such classification gave rise to the understanding of the electronic properties of the material, but also to the prediction of other members of the family (many dozens of them) as well as to the way to classify those. Whereas the originally-synthesised MoSi2N4 is a semiconductor, some of the members of the family are also metallic and some even demonstrate magnetic properties. Interestingly, the room-temperature mobility predicted for such crystals can be as high few thousands cm^2/V*s (hole mobility typically higher than electron) with some record cases as high as 5*10^4 cm^22/V*s, making these materials strong contenders for future electronic applications. The major interest towards these materials is coming from the septuple layer structure, which allows multiple crystal phases, but also complex compositions, in particular those with broken mirror-reflection symmetry against the layer of metal atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation of relativistic ionization-potential (IP) equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOMCC) with up to 3-hole--2-particle (3h2p) excitations that makes use of the molecular mean-field exact two-component (mmfX2C) framework and the full Dirac--Coulomb--Breit Hamiltonian. The closed-shell nature of the reference state in an X2C-IP-EOMCC calculation allows for accurate predictions of spin-orbit splittings in open-shell molecules without breaking degeneracies, as would occur in an excitation-energy EOMCC calculation carried out directly on an unrestricted open-shell reference. We apply X2C-IP-EOMCC to the ground and first excited state of the HCCX$^+$ (X = Cl, Br, I) cations, where it is demonstrated that a large basis set (\emph{i.e.}, quadruple-zeta quality) and 3h2p correlation effects are necessary for accurate absolute energetics. The maximum error in calculated adiabatic IPs is on the order of 0.1 eV, whereas spin-orbit splittings themselves are accurate to $\approx 0.01$ eV, as compared to experimentally obtained values.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of uncertainty estimations for Gaussian process regression based machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimations for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are crucial for quantifying model error and identifying informative training samples in active learning strategies. In this study, we evaluate uncertainty estimations of Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based MLIPs, including the predictive GPR standard deviation and ensemble-based uncertainties. We do this in terms of calibration and in terms of impact on model performance in an active learning scheme. We consider GPR models with Coulomb and Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) representations as inputs to predict potential energy surfaces and excitation energies of molecules. Regarding calibration, we find that ensemble-based uncertainty estimations show already poor global calibration (e.g., averaged over the whole test set). In contrast, the GPR standard deviation shows good global calibration, but when grouping predictions by their uncertainty, we observe a systematical bias for predictions with high uncertainty. Although an increasing uncertainty correlates with an increasing bias, the bias is not captured quantitatively by the uncertainty. Therefore, the GPR standard deviation can be useful to identify predictions with a high bias and error but, without further knowledge, should not be interpreted as a quantitative measure for a potential error range. Selecting the samples with the highest GPR standard deviation from a fixed configuration space leads to a model that overemphasizes the borders of the configuration space represented in the fixed dataset. This may result in worse performance in more densely sampled areas but better generalization for extrapolation tasks.</description>
