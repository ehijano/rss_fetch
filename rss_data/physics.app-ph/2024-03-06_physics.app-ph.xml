      <title>Shape-retaining beam-like morphing structures via localized snap through</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a concept of morphing structure -- featuring an arch mounted on a compliant base -- that can be reconfigured via snap-through buckling and leverages bistability to retain its morphed shape. We show that one-dimensional arrays of such units yield beam-like structures that, upon localized snapping, can attain multiple, morphologically distinct stable shapes. Units are modeled using discrete elastic rods, a reduced-order formulation for beams and beam structures, and the results are validated via experiments. We leverage our model to understand the influence of the geometrical design parameters on the response and final shape of a unit. We then show that the morphed shapes of arrays of units can be predicted by concatenating results of simulations on single units, and leverage this idea to inverse-design structures that can be snapped into target stable shapes. Ultimately, our work suggests an up-scalable way to create shape-retaining morphing structures with target stable shapes.</description>

      <title>Depth resolution in piezoresponse force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) is one of the most widespread methods for investigating and visualizing ferroelectric domain structures down to the nanometer length scale. PFM makes use of the direct coupling of the piezoelectric response to the crystal lattice, and hence is most often applied to spatially map the 3-dimensional (3D) near-surface domain distribution of any polar or ferroic sample. Nonetheless, since most samples investigated by PFM are at least semiconducting or fully insulating, the electric ac field emerging from the conductive scanning force microscopy (SFM) tip, penetrates the sample, and hence may also couple to polar features that are deeply buried into the bulk of the sample under investigation. Thus, in the work presented here, we experimentally and theoretically explore the contrast and depth resolution capabilities of PFM, by analyzing the dependence of several key parameters. These key parameters include the depth of the buried feature, i.e. here a domain wall (DW), as well as PFM-relevant technical parameters such as the tip radius, the PFM drive voltage and frequency, and the signal-to-noise ratio. The theoretical predictions are experimentally verified using x-cut periodically-poled lithium niobate single crystals that are specially prepared into wedge-shaped samples, in order to allow the buried feature, here the DW, to be `positioned' at any depth into the bulk. This inspection essentially contributes to the fundamental understanding in PFM contrast analysis, and to the reconstruction of 3D domain structures down to a 1-$\mu$m-penetration depth into the sample.</description>

      <title>Highly Reproducible and CMOS-compatible VO2-based Oscillators for Brain-inspired Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With remarkable electrical and optical switching properties induced at low power and near room temperature (68C), vanadium dioxide (VO2) has sparked rising interest in unconventional computing among the phase-change materials research community. The scalability and the potential to compute beyond the von Neumann model make VO2 especially appealing for implementation in oscillating neural networks for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, to solve constraint satisfaction problems, and for pattern recognition. Its integration into large networks of oscillators on a Silicon platform still poses challenges associated with the stabilization in the correct oxidation state and the ability to fabricate a structure with predictable electrical behavior showing very low variability. In this work, the role played by the different annealing parameters applied by three methods (slow thermal annealing, flash annealing, and rapid thermal annealing), following the vanadium oxide atomic layer deposition (ALD), on the formation of VO2 grains is studied and an optimal substrate stack configuration that minimizes variability between devices is proposed. Material and electrical characterizations are performed on the different films and a step-by-step recipe to build reproducible VO2-based oscillators is presented, which is argued to be made possible thanks to the introduction of a hafnium oxide (HfO2) layer between the silicon substrate and the vanadium oxide layer. Up to seven nearly identical VO2-based devices are contacted simultaneously to create a network of oscillators, paving the way for large-scale implementation of VO2 oscillating neural networks.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent nano- and microparticles for sensing cellular microenvironment: past, present and future applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) features distinct hallmarks, including acidosis, hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and altered ion fluxes, which are crucial targets for early cancer biomarker detection, tumor diagnosis, and therapeutic strategies. A variety of imaging and sensing techniques have been developed and employed in both research and clinical settings to visualize and monitor cellular and TME dynamics. Among these, ratiometric fluorescence-based sensors have emerged as powerful analytical tools, providing precise and sensitive insights into the TME and enabling real-time detection and tracking of dynamic changes. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the latest advancements in ratiometric fluorescent probes designed for optical mapping of pH, oxygen, ROS, ions, and biomarkers within the TME. We elucidate their structural designs and sensing mechanisms, as well as their applications in in vitro and in vivo detection. Furthermore, we explore integrated sensing platforms that reveal the spatiotemporal behavior of complex tumor cultures, highlighting the potential of high-resolution imaging techniques combined with computational methods. This review aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding the current state of the art and the future potential of fluorescent nano- and microparticles in the field of cellular microenvironment sensing.</description>

      <title>Exciplex-driven blue OLEDs: unlocking multifunctionality applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development of multifunctional blue-emission organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using TADF-exciplex materials. These OLEDs exhibit sensitivity to external stimuli and achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.6 % through partly liquid processing. This technique allows for large-scale production on arbitrary geometries.
  The potential multifunctionality of the devices arises from their response to low external magnetic fields (up to 100 mT) with an efficiency up to 2.5 % for magnetoconductance, while maximum magneto-electroluminescence effects of 4.1 % were detected. We investigated novel aspects, including the utilization of two organic materials without further doping and the investigation of the impact of 2,2',2''-(1,3,5-Benzinetriyl)-tris(1phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) processing in liquid and vapor form. The insights gained provide a fundamental understanding regarding the applicability of exciplex (EX) materials for fully solution-processed OLEDs through a deliberate omission of doping. Our work represents a significant advancement on the path towards multifunctional OLED technology, with potential applications in cost-efficient, scalable organic full-color displays and advanced sensing system</description>

      <title>Remote sensing of soil moisture using Rydberg atoms and satellite signals of opportunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spaceborne radar remote sensing of the earth system is essential to study natural and man-made changes in the ecosystem, water and energy cycles, weather and air quality, sea level, and surface dynamics. A major challenge with current approaches is the lack of broad spectrum tunability due to narrow band microwave electronics, that limit systems to specific science variable retrievals. This results in a significant limitation in studying dynamic coupled earth system processes such as surface and subsurface hydrology, where broad spectrum radar remote sensing is needed to sense multiple variables simultaneously. Rydberg atomic sensors are highly sensitive broad-spectrum quantum detectors that can be dynamically tuned to cover micro-to-millimeter waves with no requirement for band-specific electronics. Rydberg atomic sensors can use existing transmitted signals such as navigation and communication satellites to enable remote sensing. We demonstrate remote sensing of soil moisture, an important earth system variable, via ground-based radar reflectometry with Rydberg atomic systems. To do this, we sensitize the atoms to XM satellite radio signals and use signal correlations to demonstrate use of these satellite signals for remote sensing of soil moisture. Our approach provides a step towards satellite-based broad-spectrum Rydberg atomic remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Encoded Lenticular Nano-Printing with Single-Layer Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurface-based nano-printing has enabled ultrahigh-resolution grayscale or color image display. However, the maximum number of independent nano-printing images allowed by one single-layer metasurface is still limited despite many multiplexing methods that have been proposed to increase the design degree of freedom. In this work, we substantially push the multiplexing limit of nano-printing by transforming images at different observation angles into mapping the corresponding images to different positions in the Fourier space, and simultaneously controlling the complex electric field across multiple polarization channels. Our proposed Polarization-Encoded Lenticular Nano-Printing (Pollen), aided by a modified evolutionary algorithm, allows the display of several images based on the viewing angle, similar to traditional lenticular printing but without requiring a lenticular layer. In addition, it extends the display capability to encompass multiple polarization states. Empowered by the ability to control the complex amplitude of three polarization channels, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the generation of 13 distinguished gray-scale Chinese ink wash painting images, 49 binary patterns, and three sets of 3D nano-printing images, totaling 25 unique visuals. These results present the largest number of recorded images with ultra-high resolution to date. Our innovative Pollen technique is expected to benefit the development of modern optical applications, including but not limited to optical encryption, optical data storage, lightweight display, and augmented reality and virtual reality.</description>

      <title>A chip-integrated comb-based microwave oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-noise microwave oscillators are cornerstones for wireless communication, radar and clocks. Optical frequency combs have enabled photonic microwaves with unrivalled noise performance and bandwidth. Emerging interest is to generate microwaves using chip-based frequency combs, namely microcombs. Here, we demonstrate the first, fully integrated, microcomb-based, microwave oscillator chip. The chip, powered by a microelectronic circuit, leverages hybrid integration of a DFB laser, a nonlinear microresonator, and a high-speed photodetector. Each component represents the best of its own class, yet allows large-volume manufacturing with low cost in CMOS foundries. The hybrid chip outputs an ultralow-noise laser of 6.9 Hz linewidth, a microcomb of 10.7 GHz repetition rate, and a 10.7 GHz microwave of 6.3 mHz linewidth -- all three in one entity of 76 mm$^2$ size.The microwave phase noise reaches -75/-105/-130 dBc/Hz at 1/10/100 kHz Fourier offset frequency. Our results can reinvigorate our information society for communication, sensing, timing and precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Spintronic Implementation of UNet for Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in computer vision applications like self-driving cars, satellite imagery analysis, and medical diagnosis. Implementing these complex deep neural networks on conventional hardware is highly inefficient. In this work, we propose hardware implementation of UNet for segmentation tasks, using spintronic devices. Our approach involves designing hardware for convolution, deconvolution, ReLU, and max pooling layers of the UNet architecture. We demonstrate the synaptic behavior of the domain wall MTJ, and design convolution and deconvolution layers using the domain wall-based crossbar array. We utilize the orthogonal current injected MTJ with its continuous resistance change and showcase the ReLU and max pooling functions. We employ a hybrid simulation setup by coupling micromagnetic simulation, non-equilibrium Green's function, Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equations, and circuit simulation with Python programming to incorporate the diverse physics of spin-transport, magnetization dynamics, and CMOS elements in our proposed designs. We evaluate our UNet design on the CamVid dataset and achieve segmentation accuracies that are comparable to software implementation. During training, our design consumes 43.59pJ of energy for synaptic weight updates.</description>

      <title>Generation of gigahertz frequency surface acoustic waves in YIG/ZnO heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/zinc oxide (ZnO) heterostructures, comparing the results of a computationally lightweight analytical model with time-resolved micro-focused Brillouin light scattering data. Interdigital transducers (IDTs), with operational frequencies in the gigahertz regime, were fabricated on 50 and 100nm thin films of YIG prior to sputter deposition of 830nm and 890nm films of piezoelectric ZnO. We find good agreement between our analytical model and micro-focused Brillouin light scattering data of the IDT frequency response and SAW group velocity, with clear differentiation between the Rayleigh and Sezawa-like modes. This work paves the way for the study of SAW-spin wave (SW) interactions in low SW damping YIG, with the possibility of a method for future energy-efficient SW excitation.</description>

      <title>Full-magnetic implementation of a classical Toffoli gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Toffoli gate is the essential ingredient for reversible computing, an energy efficient classical computational paradigm that evades the energy dissipation resulting from Landauer's principle. In this paper we analyze different setups to realize a magnetic implementation of the Toffoli gate using three interacting classical spins, each one embodying one of the three bits needed for the Toffoli gate. In our scheme, different control-spins configurations produce an effective field capable of conditionally flipping the target spin. We study what are the experimental requirements for the realization of our scheme, focusing on the degree of local control, the ability to dynamically switch the spin-spin interactions, and the required single-spin anisotropies to make the classical spin stable, showing that these are compatible with current technology.</description>
