      <title>Dynamical typicality in elementary cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of elementary cellular automata (CA) using numerical simulations. We follow the dynamics of macroscopic observables, which depend on the state of a large number of sites. If we consider the ensemble of states that share the same value of some macroscopic observable, for example, the density, we find that the dynamics of such macroscopic observable is approximately the same for the vast majority of the states in the ensemble, irrespective of the microscopic details, provided that the system size $N$ is large enough. Moreover, we find that the dynamics of any other macroscopic observable is also very similar for members of the same ensemble. We show that the ensemble fluctuations around the average macro-trajectory vanish as $N^{-1/2}$, irrespective of the observable and the dynamical rule. We show that the same phenomenon is present if we define our initial condition ensemble by fixing more than one macroscopic observable. The ensuing ``dynamical typicality'' phenomenon is very similar to what was recently found in the context of the dynamics of isolated quantum systems. Our results suggest that the same feature is likely to be found in a wide variety of complex dynamical systems. We also discuss the implications of our findings regarding the ability of CA to simulate physical systems.</description>

      <title>Spin cones in random-field XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the arrangement of spins in the ground state of the XY model with quenched, random fields, on a fully connected graph. Two types of disordered fields are considered, namely randomly oriented magnetic fields, and randomly oriented crystal fields. Orientations are chosen from a uniformly isotropic distribution, but disorder fluctuations in each realization of a finite system lead to a breaking of rotational symmetry. The result is an interesting pattern of spin orientations, found by solving a system of coupled, nonlinear equations within perturbation theory and also by exact numerical continuation. All spins lie within a cone for small enough ratio of field to coupling strength, with an interesting distribution of spin orientations, with peaks at the cone edges. The orientation of the cone depends strongly on the realization of disorder, but the opening angle does not. In the case of random magnetic fields, the cone angle widens as the ratio increases till a critical value at which there is a first order phase transition and the cone disappears. With random crystal fields, there is no phase transition and the cone angle approaches $180^\circ$ for large values of the ratio. At finite low temperatures, Monte-Carlo simulations show that the formation of a cone and its subsequent alignment along the equilibrium direction occur on two different time scales.</description>

      <title>Time-correlation functions of stochastic three-sphere micromachines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss and compare the statistical properties of two stochastic three-sphere micromachines, i.e., odd micromachine and thermal micromachine. We calculate the steady state time-correlation functions for these micromachines and decompose them into the symmetric and antisymmetric parts. In both cases, the cross-correlation between the two spring extensions has an antisymmetric part, which is a direct consequence of the broken time-reversal symmetry. For the odd micromachine, the antisymmetric part of the correlation function is proportional to the odd elasticity, whereas it is proportional to the temperature difference between the two edge spheres for the thermal micromachine. The entropy production rate and the Green-Kubo relations for the two micromachines are also obtained. Comparing the results of the two models, we argue an effective odd elastic constant of the thermal micromachine. The effective odd elasticity of the thermal micromachine is proportional to the temperature difference among the spheres, which causes an internal heat flow and leads to directional locomotion in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions.</description>

      <title>Immediate recapture in the trapping-detrapping process of a single charge carrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously we have shown that pure 1/f noise arises from the trapping-detrapping process when traps are heterogeneous. Namely, the trapping-detrapping process relies on the assumption that detrapping rates of individual trapping centers in the condensed matter are random and uniformly distributed. Another assumption underlying the trapping-detrapping process was that both trapping and detrapping times need to have non-zero duration. Here we violate the latter assumption by introducing immediate recapture of the charge carrier. We show that 1/f noise will still be observed, though the range of frequencies over which it will be observed shifts to the lower frequency range as the immediate recapture probability increases.</description>

      <title>Emerging Jordan blocks in the two-dimensional Potts and loop models at generic $Q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently suggested -- based on general self-consistency arguments as well as results from the bootstrap (arXiv:2005.07708, arXiv:2007.11539, arXiv:2007.04190) -- that the CFT describing the $Q$-state Potts model is logarithmic for generic values of $Q$, with rank-two Jordan blocks for $L_0$ and ${\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu L\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu}_0$ in many sectors of the theory. This is despite the well-known fact that the lattice transfer matrix (or Hamiltonian) is diagonalizable in (arbitrary) finite size. While the emergence of Jordan blocks only in the limit $L\to\infty$ is perfectly possible conceptually, diagonalizability in finite size makes the measurement of logarithmic couplings (whose values are analytically predicted in arXiv:2007.11539, arXiv:2007.04190) very challenging. This problem is solved in the present paper (which can be considered a companion to arXiv:2007.11539), and the conjectured logarithmic structure of the CFT confirmed in detail by the study of the lattice model and associated "emerging Jordan blocks."</description>

      <title>Simulating the dynamics of large many-body quantum systems with Schr\"odinger-Feynman techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of powerful numerical techniques has drastically improved our understanding of quantum matter out of equilibrium. Inspired by recent progress in the area of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, this paper highlights hybrid Schr\"odinger-Feynman techniques as an innovative approach to efficiently simulate certain aspects of many-body quantum dynamics on classical computers. To this end, we explore the nonequilibrium dynamics of two large subsystems, which interact sporadically in time, but otherwise evolve independently from each other. We consider subsystems with tunable disorder strength, relevant in the context of many-body localization, where one subsystem can act as a bath for the other. Importantly, studying the full interacting system, we observe that signatures of thermalization are enhanced compared to the reference case of having two independent subsystems. Notably, with the here proposed Schr\"odinger-Feynman method, we are able to simulate the pure-state survival probability in systems significantly larger than accessible by standard sparse-matrix techniques.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Long-Time Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems by Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerically computing physical quantities of time-evolved states in quantum many-body systems is a challenging task in general. Here, we propose a method that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately forecast long-time behavior. The method is based on the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. The effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are studied, even when the input data exhibits complicated features such as multiple oscillatory components and a power-law decay with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike fluid dynamics. It is demonstrated that the present method enables accurate forecasts at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with the experimental data. We find that a few percent of noise does not affect the prediction accuracy destructively.</description>

      <title>Theory of the inverse Faraday effect in dissipative Rashba electron systems: Floquet engineering perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), i.e., photo-induced magnetization, in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled electron systems irradiated by a circularly polarized light. Quantum master (GKSL) equation enables us to accurately compute the laser driven dynamics, taking inevitable dissipation effects into account. To find the universal features of laser-driven magnetization and its dynamics, we investigate (i) the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) driven by a continuous wave (CW) and (ii) ultrafast spin dynamics driven by short laser pulses. In the NESS (i), the laser-induced magnetization and its dependence of several parameters (laser frequency, laser field strength, temperature, dissipation strength, etc.) are shown to be in good agreement with the predictions from Floquet theory for dissipative systems in the high-frequency regime. In the case (ii), we focus on ferromagnetic metal states by introducing an effective magnetic field to the Rashba model as the mean field of electron-electron interaction. We find that a precession of the magnetic moment occurs due to the pulse-driven instantaneous magnetic field and the initial phase of the precession is controlled by changing the sign of light polarization. This is well consistent with the spin dynamics observed in experiments of laser-pulse-driven IFE. We discuss how the pulse-driven dynamics are captured by the Floquet theory. Our results provides a microscopic method to compute ultrafast dynamics in many electron systems irradiated by intense light.</description>

      <title>Scaled Brownian motion with random anomalous diffusion exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaled Brownian motion (SBM) is regarded as one of the paradigmatic random processes, featuring the anomalous diffusion property characterized by the diffusion exponent. It is a Gaussian, self-similar process with independent increments, which has found applications across various fields, from turbulence and stochastic hydrology to biophysics. In our paper, inspired by recent single particle tracking biological experiments, we introduce a process termed the scaled Brownian motion with random exponent (SBMRE), which preserves SBM characteristics at the level of individual trajectories, albeit with randomly varying anomalous diffusion exponents across the trajectories. We discuss the main probabilistic properties of SBMRE, including its probability density function (pdf), and the q-th absolute moment. Additionally, we present the expected value of the time-averaged mean squared displacement (TAMSD) and the ergodicity breaking parameter. Furthermore, we analyze the pdf of the first hitting time in a semi-infinite domain, the martingale property of SBMRE, and its stochastic exponential. As special cases, we consider two distributions of the anomalous diffusion exponent, namely the two-point and beta distributions, and discuss the asymptotics of the presented characteristics in such cases. Theoretical results for SBMRE are validated through numerical simulations and compared with the corresponding characteristics for SBM.</description>

      <title>Hydroelectric energy conversion of waste flows through hydro-electronic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydraulic energy is a key component of the global energy mix, yet there exists no practical way of harvesting it at small scales, from flows at low Reynolds number. This has triggered the search for alternative hydroelectric conversion methodologies, leading to unconventional proposals based on droplet triboelectricity, water evaporation, osmotic energy or flow-induced ionic Coulomb drag. Yet, these approaches systematically rely on ions as intermediate charge carriers, limiting the achievable power density. Here, we predict that the kinetic energy of small-scale "waste" flows can be directly and efficiently converted into electricity thanks to the hydro-electronic drag effect, by which an ion-free liquid induces an electronic current in the solid wall along which it flows. This effect originates in the fluctuation-induced coupling between fluid motion and electron transport. We develop a non-equilibrium thermodynamic formalism to assess the efficiency of such hydroelectric energy conversion, dubbed hydronic energy. We find that hydronic energy conversion is analogous to thermoelectricity, with the efficiency being controlled by a dimensionless figure of merit. However, in contrast to its thermoelectric analogue, this figure of merit combines independently tunable parameters of the solid and the liquid, and can thus significantly exceed unity. Our findings suggest new strategies for blue energy harvesting without electrochemistry, and for waste flow mitigation in membrane-based filtration processes.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Temporal relaxation of disordered many-body quantum systems under driving and dissipation</title>

Abstract: Strong disorder inhibits thermalization in isolated quantum systems and may lead to many-body localization (MBL). In realistic situations, however, the observation of MBL is hindered by residual couplings of the system to an environment, which acts as a bath and pushes the system to thermal equilibrium. This paper is concerned with the transient dynamics prior to thermalization and studies how the relaxation of a disordered system is altered under the influence of external driving and dissipation. We consider a scenario where a disordered quantum spin chain is placed into a strong magnetic field that polarizes the system. By suddenly removing the external field, a nonequilibrium situation is induced and the decay of magnetization probes the degree of localization. We show that by driving the system with light, one can distinguish between different dynamical regimes as the spins are more or less susceptible to the drive depending on the strength of the disorder. We provide evidence that some of these signatures remain observable at intermediate time scales even when the spin chain is subject to noise due to coupling to an environment. From a numerical point of view, we demonstrate that the open-system dynamics starting from a class of experimentally relevant mixed initial states can be efficiently simulated by combining dynamical quantum typicality with stochastic unraveling of Lindblad master equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation and the subsequent dynamics of shock waves in repulsive one-dimensional Bose gases during the free expansion of a density hump. By building coherent Fermi states for interacting Bethe fermions, we define a quantum fluctuating initial state expressed in terms of universal quantities, namely the density and the Luttinger parameter. In the integrable case, this fluctuating state is then evolved by generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) and, differently from non-fluctuating initial states, it develops density ripples on top of the hydrodynamic mean value. Our analysis gives a general theory of quantum ripples and wave breaking in integrable and quasi-integrable one-dimensional liquids and clarifies the role of the interaction strength. In particular, for strongly/intermediately interacting bosons, we find quantum ripples originating from low-energy modes at the Fermi surface interfering when transported by GHD. In the low coupling limit, near the quasicondensate regime, we find instead that density ripples have a semi-classical nature, and their description requires information on the curvature of the Fermi surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Simple Inclusion Process (SIP) interpolates between two well-known lattice gas models: the independent random walkers and the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model. Here we study large deviations of nonstationary mass transfer in the SIP at long times in one dimension. We suppose that $N\gg 1$ particles start from a single lattice site at the origin, and we are interested in the probability $\mathcal{P}(M,N,T)$ of observing $M$ particles, $0\leq M\leq N$, to the right of the origin at a specified time $T\gg 1$. At large times, the corresponding probability distribution has a large-deviation behavior, $-\ln \mathcal{P}(M,N,T) \simeq \sqrt{T} s(M/N,N/\sqrt{T})$. We determine the rate function $s$ exactly by uncovering and utilizing complete integrability, by the inverse scattering method, of the underlying equations of the macroscopic fluctuation theory. We also analyze different asymptotic limits of the rate function $s$.</description>

Abstract: Interacting fermionic ladders are important platforms to study quantum phases of matter, such as different types of Mott insulators. In particular, the D-Mott and S-Mott states hold pre-formed fermion pairs and become paired-fermion liquids upon doping (d-wave and s-wave, respectively). We show that the D-Mott and S-Mott phases are in fact two facets of the same topological phase and that the transition between them is terminable. These results provide a quantum analog of the well-known terminable liquid-to-gas transition. However, the phenomenology we uncover is even richer, as in contrast to the former, the order of the transition can be tuned by the interactions from continuous to first-order. The findings are based on numerical results using the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism for infinite systems, and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finite systems. This is complemented by analytical field-theoretical explanations. In particular, we present an effective theory to explain the change of transition order, which is potentially applicable to a broad range of other systems. The role of symmetries and edge states are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir probing of quantum information scrambling</title>

Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is the dynamical process where initially localized quantum information spreads over diverse degrees of freedom. Out-of-time-order correlators and tripartite mutual information have been utilized as key metrics to investigate scrambling, with a specific emphasis on the asymptotic behaviors in the long-time regime and the initial spreads in the early-time regime. An open question is the comprehensive clarification of the dynamics of information propagation, covering the intermediate-time regime. Here, by extending the idea of quantum reservoir computing, we propose quantum reservoir probing (QRP) to diagnose scrambling in a unified manner for arbitrary degrees of freedom at arbitrary times, through information estimation performance. As a paradigmatic example, we investigate a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We show that the QRP successfully distinguishes between quasiparticle-mediated information propagation in a free fermion system and correlation-mediated scrambling in a quantum chaotic system, all while showcasing its experimental simplicity. Furthermore, by systematically scanning the read-out operators, we can identify the system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over the conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum Darwinism-encoding transitions on expanding trees</title>

Abstract: Quantum Darwinism (QD) proposes that classical objectivity emerges from the broadcast of information about a microscopic degree of freedom into multiple fractions of a many-body environment. Such a broadcast of information is in sharp contrast with its scrambling under strong interaction. It was recently shown that quantum dynamics interpolating between broadcasting and scrambling may display sharp phase transitions of information propagation, named QD-encoding transitions. Here, we initiate their systematic study in generic, non-Clifford settings. First, in a general theoretical setup where the information propagation is modeled as an isometry, whose input qudit is entangled with a reference, we propose a probe of the transitions -- the distribution of the density matrix of the reference after measuring an environment fraction. This probe measures the classical correlation between the fraction and the injected information. We then apply the framework to two similar models defined by a tensor network on an expanding tree, modeling a noisy apparatus that attempts to broadcast the $z$ component of a spin-half. We derive an exact recursion relation of the density matrix distribution, which we analyze analytically and numerically. As a result we find three phases: QD, intermediate and encoding, and two continuous transitions. The encoding-intermediate transition describes the establishment of nonzero correlation between the reference and a small environment fraction, and can be probed by a ``coarse-grained'' measure of the total spin-$z$ of the fraction, which becomes non-Gaussian and symmetry breaking in the intermediate space. The QD-intermediate transition is about whether the correlation is perfect. It must be probed by fined-grained measures, and corresponds to a more subtle symmetry breaking in the replica space.</description>

      <title>Approximating many-body quantum states with quantum circuits and measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce protocols to prepare many-body quantum states with quantum circuits assisted by local operations and classical communication. We show that by lifting the requirement of exact preparation, one can substantially save resources. In particular, the so-called $W$ and, more generally, Dicke states require a circuit depth and number of ancillas per site that are independent of the system size. As a biproduct of our work, we introduce an efficient scheme to implement certain non-local, non-Clifford unitary operators. We also discuss how similar ideas my be applied in the preparation of eigenstates of well-known spin models, both free and interacting.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kramers-Wanier Duality from Bilinear Phase Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Bilinear Phase Map (BPM), a concept that extends the Kramers-Wannier (KW) transformation to investigate unconventional gapped phases, their dualities, and phase transitions. Defined by a matrix of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ elements, the BPM not only encapsulates the essence of KW duality but also enables exploration of a broader spectrum of generalized quantum phases and dualities. By analyzing the BPM's linear algebraic properties, we elucidate the loss of unitarity in duality transformations and derive general non-invertible fusion rules. Applying this framework to (1+1)D systems yields the discovery of new dualities, shedding light on the interplay between various Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) phases. Additionally, we construct a duality web that interconnects these phases and their transitions, offering valuable insights into relations between different quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Finite-time Scaling beyond the Kibble-Zurek Prerequisite: Driven Critical Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Dirac Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional quantum critical point (QCP) characterized by order parameter fluctuations, the celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and finite-time scaling (FTS) theory provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics. However, in strongly correlated fermionic systems where gapless fermions are usually present in vicinity of QCP, the driven dynamics has rarely been explored. In this Letter, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the QCP triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order-parameter bosons. By studying the evolution of physical quantities for different driving rates through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we confirm that the driven dynamics is described by the FTS form. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory by relaxing its requirement for a gapped initial state to the system accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitation. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.</description>
