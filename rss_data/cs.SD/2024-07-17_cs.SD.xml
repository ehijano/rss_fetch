      <title>A Pilot Study of GSLM-based Simulation of Foreign Accentuation Only Using Native Speech Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method of simulating the human process of foreign accentuation using Generative Spoken Language Model (GSLM) only with native speech corpora. When one listens to spoken words of a foreign language and repeats them, the repeated speech is often with the accent of that listener's L1. This is said to be because the spoken words are mentally represented as a sequence of phonological units of the L1, and those units are used for oral reproduction. We simulate this process by inputting speech of language A into GSLM of language B to add B's accent onto the input speech. The process of running ASR of the L1 for foreign input speech and giving the ASR result to TTS of the L1 can be viewed as a naive implementation of this approach. The results of our experiments show that the synthesized accent of the output speech is highly natural, compared to real samples of A generated by speakers whose L1 is B, and that the degree of accentuation is controllable.</description>

      <title>MMSD-Net: Towards Multi-modal Stuttering Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stuttering is a common speech impediment that is caused by irregular disruptions in speech production, affecting over 70 million people across the world. Standard automatic speech processing tools do not take speech ailments into account and are thereby not able to generate meaningful results when presented with stuttered speech as input. The automatic detection of stuttering is an integral step towards building efficient, context-aware speech processing systems. While previous approaches explore both statistical and neural approaches for stuttering detection, all of these methods are uni-modal in nature. This paper presents MMSD-Net, the first multi-modal neural framework for stuttering detection. Experiments and results demonstrate that incorporating the visual signal significantly aids stuttering detection, and our model yields an improvement of 2-17% in the F1-score over existing state-of-the-art uni-modal approaches.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effect of Label Topology and Training Criterion on ASR Performance and Alignment Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing research scenario for automatic speech recognition (ASR) envisions a clear division between end-to-end approaches and classic modular systems. Even though a high-level comparison between the two approaches in terms of their requirements and (dis)advantages is commonly addressed, a closer comparison under similar conditions is not readily available in the literature. In this work, we present a comparison focused on the label topology and training criterion. We compare two discriminative alignment models with hidden Markov model (HMM) and connectionist temporal classification topology, and two first-order label context ASR models utilizing factored HMM and strictly monotonic recurrent neural network transducer, respectively. We use different measurements for the evaluation of the alignment quality, and compare word error rate and real time factor of our best systems. Experiments are conducted on the LibriSpeech 960h and Switchboard 300h tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Gender-Specific Speech Patterns in Automatic Suicide Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In emergency medicine, timely intervention for patients at risk of suicide is often hindered by delayed access to specialised psychiatric care. To bridge this gap, we introduce a speech-based approach for automatic suicide risk assessment. Our study involves a novel dataset comprising speech recordings of 20 patients who read neutral texts. We extract four speech representations encompassing interpretable and deep features. Further, we explore the impact of gender-based modelling and phrase-level normalisation. By applying gender-exclusive modelling, features extracted from an emotion fine-tuned wav2vec2.0 model can be utilised to discriminate high- from low- suicide risk with a balanced accuracy of 81%. Finally, our analysis reveals a discrepancy in the relationship of speech characteristics and suicide risk between female and male subjects. For men in our dataset, suicide risk increases together with agitation while voice characteristics of female subjects point the other way.</description>

      <title>Knowledge boosting during low-latency inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models for low-latency, streaming applications could benefit from the knowledge capacity of larger models, but edge devices cannot run these models due to resource constraints. A possible solution is to transfer hints during inference from a large model running remotely to a small model running on-device. However, this incurs a communication delay that breaks real-time requirements and does not guarantee that both models will operate on the same data at the same time. We propose knowledge boosting, a novel technique that allows a large model to operate on time-delayed input during inference, while still boosting small model performance. Using a streaming neural network that processes 8 ms chunks, we evaluate different speech separation and enhancement tasks with communication delays of up to six chunks or 48 ms. Our results show larger gains where the performance gap between the small and large models is wide, demonstrating a promising method for large-small model collaboration for low-latency applications.

      <title>Disentangled Acoustic Fields For Multimodal Physical Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of multimodal physical scene understanding, where an embodied agent needs to find fallen objects by inferring object properties, direction, and distance of an impact sound source. Previous works adopt feed-forward neural networks to directly regress the variables from sound, leading to poor generalization and domain adaptation issues. In this paper, we illustrate that learning a disentangled model of acoustic formation, referred to as disentangled acoustic field (DAF), to capture the sound generation and propagation process, enables the embodied agent to construct a spatial uncertainty map over where the objects may have fallen. We demonstrate that our analysis-by-synthesis framework can jointly infer sound properties by explicitly decomposing and factorizing the latent space of the disentangled model. We further show that the spatial uncertainty map can significantly improve the success rate for the localization of fallen objects by proposing multiple plausible exploration locations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Binary: Multiclass Paraphasia Detection with Generative Pretrained Transformers and End-to-End Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aphasia is a language disorder that can lead to speech errors known as paraphasias, which involve the misuse, substitution, or invention of words. Automatic paraphasia detection can help those with Aphasia by facilitating clinical assessment and treatment planning options. However, most automatic paraphasia detection works have focused solely on binary detection, which involves recognizing only the presence or absence of a paraphasia. Multiclass paraphasia detection represents an unexplored area of research that focuses on identifying multiple types of paraphasias and where they occur in a given speech segment. We present novel approaches that use a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) to identify paraphasias from transcripts as well as two end-to-end approaches that focus on modeling both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and paraphasia classification as multiple sequences vs. a single sequence. We demonstrate that a single sequence model outperforms GPT baselines for multiclass paraphasia detection.</description>

      <title>Statistics-aware Audio-visual Deepfake Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an enhanced audio-visual deep detection method. Recent methods in audio-visual deepfake detection mostly assess the synchronization between audio and visual features. Although they have shown promising results, they are based on the maximization/minimization of isolated feature distances without considering feature statistics. Moreover, they rely on cumbersome deep learning architectures and are heavily dependent on empirically fixed hyperparameters. Herein, to overcome these limitations, we propose: (1) a statistical feature loss to enhance the discrimination capability of the model, instead of relying solely on feature distances; (2) using the waveform for describing the audio as a replacement of frequency-based representations; (3) a post-processing normalization of the fakeness score; (4) the use of shallower network for reducing the computational complexity. Experiments on the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Universal Sound Separation with Self-Supervised Audio Masked Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal sound separation (USS) is a task of separating mixtures of arbitrary sound sources. Typically, universal separation models are trained from scratch in a supervised manner, using labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging deep learning approach that leverages unlabeled data to obtain task-agnostic representations, which can benefit many downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose integrating a self-supervised pre-trained model, namely the audio masked autoencoder (A-MAE), into a universal sound separation system to enhance its separation performance. We employ two strategies to utilize SSL embeddings: freezing or updating the parameters of A-MAE during fine-tuning. The SSL embeddings are concatenated with the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to serve as input features for the separation model. We evaluate our methods on the AudioSet dataset, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed methods successfully enhance the separation performance of a state-of-the-art ResUNet-based USS model.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective and Efficient Non-autoregressive Decoding Using Block-based Attention Mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-autoregressive (NAR) block-based Attention Mask Decoder (AMD) that flexibly balances performance-efficiency trade-offs for Conformer ASR systems. AMD performs parallel NAR inference within contiguous blocks of output labels that are concealed using attention masks, while conducting left-to-right AR prediction and history context amalgamation between blocks. A beam search algorithm is designed to leverage a dynamic fusion of CTC, AR Decoder, and AMD probabilities. Experiments on the LibriSpeech-100hr corpus suggest the tripartite Decoder incorporating the AMD module produces a maximum decoding speed-up ratio of 1.73x over the baseline CTC+AR decoding, while incurring no statistically significant word error rate (WER) increase on the test sets. When operating with the same decoding real time factors, statistically significant WER reductions of up to 0.7% and 0.3% absolute (5.3% and 6.1% relative) were obtained over the CTC+AR baseline.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Reflective Learning through Self-distillation and Online Clustering for Speaker Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speaker representation learning is critical for modern voice recognition systems. While supervised learning techniques require extensive labeled data, unsupervised methodologies can leverage vast unlabeled corpora, offering a scalable solution. This paper introduces self-supervised reflective learning (SSRL), a novel paradigm that streamlines existing iterative unsupervised frameworks. SSRL integrates self-supervised knowledge distillation with online clustering to refine pseudo labels and train the model without iterative bottlenecks. Specifically, a teacher model continually refines pseudo labels through online clustering, providing dynamic supervision signals to train the student model. The student model undergoes noisy student training with input and model noise to boost its modeling capacity. The teacher model is updated via an exponential moving average of the student, acting as an ensemble of past iterations. Further, a pseudo label queue retains historical labels for consistency, and noisy label modeling directs learning towards clean samples. Experiments on VoxCeleb show SSRL's superiority over current iterative approaches, surpassing the performance of a 5-round method in just a single training round. Ablation studies validate the contributions of key components like noisy label modeling and pseudo label queues. Moreover, consistent improvements in pseudo labeling and the convergence of cluster counts demonstrate SSRL's effectiveness in deciphering unlabeled data. This work marks an important advancement in efficient and accurate speaker representation learning through the novel reflective learning paradigm.</description>

      <title>Extending Multilingual Speech Synthesis to 100+ Languages without Transcribed Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collecting high-quality studio recordings of audio is challenging, which limits the language coverage of text-to-speech (TTS) systems. This paper proposes a framework for scaling a multilingual TTS model to 100+ languages using found data without supervision. The proposed framework combines speech-text encoder pretraining with unsupervised training using untranscribed speech and unspoken text data sources, thereby leveraging massively multilingual joint speech and text representation learning. Without any transcribed speech in a new language, this TTS model can generate intelligible speech in &gt;30 unseen languages (CER difference of &lt;10% to ground truth). With just 15 minutes of transcribed, found data, we can reduce the intelligibility difference to 1% or less from the ground-truth, and achieve naturalness scores that match the ground-truth in several languages.</description>

      <title>Dance Any Beat: Blending Beats with Visuals in Dance Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated choreography advances by generating dance from music. Current methods create skeleton keypoint sequences, not full dance videos, and cannot make specific individuals dance, limiting their real-world use. These methods also need precise keypoint annotations, making data collection difficult and restricting the use of self-made video datasets. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel task: generating dance videos directly from images of individuals guided by music. This task enables the dance generation of specific individuals without requiring keypoint annotations, making it more versatile and applicable to various situations. Our solution, the Dance Any Beat Diffusion model (DabFusion), utilizes a reference image and a music piece to generate dance videos featuring various dance types and choreographies. The music is analyzed by our specially designed music encoder, which identifies essential features including dance style, movement, and rhythm. DabFusion excels in generating dance videos not only for individuals in the training dataset but also for any previously unseen person. This versatility stems from its approach of generating latent optical flow, which contains all necessary motion information to animate any person in the image. We evaluate DabFusion's performance using the AIST++ dataset, focusing on video quality, audio-video synchronization, and motion-music alignment. We propose a 2D Motion-Music Alignment Score (2D-MM Align), which builds on the Beat Alignment Score to more effectively evaluate motion-music alignment for this new task. Experiments show that our DabFusion establishes a solid baseline for this innovative task. Video results can be found on our project page: https://DabFusion.github.io.</description>

      <title>SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model for Audio-Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task holds significant potential for applications. Compared to traditional unimodal approaches, the multi-modal input of AVQA makes feature extraction and fusion processes more challenging. Euclidean space is difficult to effectively represent multi-dimensional relationships of data. Especially when extracting and processing data with a tree structure or hierarchical structure, Euclidean space is not suitable as an embedding space. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is effective in capturing the dynamic relationships between elements in a sequence. However, the self-attention mechanism's limitations in window modeling and quadratic computational complexity reduce its effectiveness in modeling long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model to integrate the advantages of hyperbolic geometry and state space models. Specifically, SHMamba leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical structures and complex relationships in audio-visual data. Meanwhile, the state space model captures dynamic changes over time by globally modeling the entire sequence. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive curvature hyperbolic alignment module and a cross fusion block to enhance the understanding of hierarchical structures and the dynamic exchange of cross-modal information, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHMamba outperforms previous methods with fewer parameters and computational costs. Our learnable parameters are reduced by 78.12\%, while the average performance improves by 2.53\%. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among all current major methods and is more suitable for practical application scenarios.</description>
