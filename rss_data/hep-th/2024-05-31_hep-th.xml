      <title>Gravitational Production of Completely Dark Photons with Nonminimal Couplings to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons are a theorized massive spin-1 particle which can be produced via various mechanisms, including cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) in the early universe. In this work, we extend previous results for GPP of dark photons to include nonminimal couplings to gravity. We find that nonminimal couplings can induce a ghost instability or lead to runaway particle production at high momentum and discuss the constraints on the parameter space such that the theory is free of instabilities. Within the instability-free regime we numerically calculate the particle production and find that the inclusion of nonminimal couplings can lead to an enhancement of the particle number. As a result, GPP of nonminimally coupled dark photons can open the parameter space for production of a cosmological relevant relic density (constituting all or part of the dark matter) as compared to the minimally-coupled theory. These results are independent of the choice of inflation model, which we demonstrate by repeating the analysis for a class of rapid-turn multi-field inflation models.</description>

      <title>Completely (iso-)split scale-invariant Coulomb branch geometries are isotrivial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that scale-invariant special Kahler geometries whose generic r-complex-dimensional abelian variety fiber is isomorphic (completely split) or isogenous (completely iso-split) as a complex torus to the product of r one-dimensional complex tori have constant $\tau^{ij}$ modulus on the Coulomb branch, i.e., are isotrivial. These simple results are useful in organizing the classification of scale-invariant special Kahler geometries, which, in turn, is relevant to the classification of possible 4-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric superconformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws From Large-N Field Theory: Solvable Model Beyond the Ridgeless Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine learning models based on neural networks exhibit scaling laws: their performance scales as power laws with respect to the sizes of the model and training data set. We use large-N field theory methods to solve a model recently proposed by Maloney, Roberts and Sully which provides a simplified setting to study neural scaling laws. Our solution extends the result in this latter paper to general nonzero values of the ridge parameter, which are essential to regularize the behavior of the model. In addition to obtaining new and more precise scaling laws, we also uncover a duality transformation at the diagrams level which explains the symmetry between model and training data set sizes. The same duality underlies recent efforts to design neural networks to simulate quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>A T-Duality of Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic Strings and an implication for Topological Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments connecting non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory to the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF), we show that the worldsheet theory with central charge $(17,\frac{3}{2})$ obtained by fibering the $(E_8)_1 \times (E_8)_1$ current algebra over the $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ sigma model on $S^{1}$ with antiperiodic spin structure (such that the two $E_8$ factors are exchanged as we go around the circle), is continuously connected to the $(E_8)_2$ theory in the Gaiotto$-$Johnson-Freyd$-$Witten sense of going "up and down the RG trajectories". Combined with the work of Tachikawa and Yamashita, this furnishes a physical derivation of the fact that the $(E_8)_2$ theory corresponds to the unique nontrivial torsion element $[(E_8)_2]$ of $\mathsf{TMF}^{31}$ with zero mod-2 elliptic genus.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping frustrated magnets: the fate of the chiral ${\rm O}(N)\times {\rm O}(2)$ universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exploring Replica-Potts CFTs in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a numerical conformal bootstrap study of CFTs with $S_n \ltimes (S_Q)^n$ global symmetry. These include CFTs that can be obtained as coupled replicas of two-dimensional critical Potts models. Particular attention is paid to the special case $S_3 \ltimes (S_3)^3$, which governs the critical behaviour of three coupled critical 3-state Potts models, a multi-scalar realisation of a (potentially) non-integrable CFT in two dimensions. The model has been studied in earlier works using perturbation theory, transfer matrices, and Monte Carlo simulations. This work represents an independent non-perturbative analysis. Our results are in agreement with previous determinations: we obtain an allowed peninsula within parameter space for the scaling dimensions of the three lowest-lying operators in the theory, which contains the earlier predictions for these scaling dimensions. Additionally, we derive numerous bounds on admissible scaling dimensions in the theory, which are compatible with earlier results. Our work sets the necessary groundwork for a future precision study of these theories in the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>String Field Theory: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of today there exist consistent, gauge-invariant string field theories describing all string theories: bosonic open and closed strings, open superstrings, heterotic strings and type II strings. The construction of these theories require algebraic ingredients, such as $A_\infty$ and $L_\infty$ homotopy algebras, geometric ingredients, relevant to the building of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and the distribution of picture changing operators, and field-theoretic ingredients, involving two-dimensional CFT's and BCFT's and Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. Applications of string field theory include the description of non-perturbative phenomena such as tachyon condensation and classical solutions, and the resolution of a number of ambiguities that bedevil the world-sheet formulation of perturbative string theory. It also allows, given a proper definition of contours of integration for momenta, for a proof of unitarity and a clear understanding of the ultraviolet finiteness of the theory. In this article we review these developments.

      <title>Hall-like behaviour of higher rank Chern-Simons theory of fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasiparticles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless ``electric'' field and a ``magnetic'' vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial ``flux-attachment'' relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton - vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Polarization Effects of Pointlike Impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop precise formulation for the effects of vacuum polarization near a pointlike source with a zero-range ($\delta$-like) potential in three spatial dimensions.
  There are different ways of introducing $\delta$-interaction in the framework of quantum theory. We discuss the approach based on the concept of self-adjoint extensions of densely defined symmetric operators. Within this approach we consider the real massive scalar field in three-dimensional Euclidean space with a single extracted point. Appropriate boundary conditions imposed at this point enable one to consider all self-adjoint extensions of $- \Delta$ as operators which can describe a pointlike source with a zero-range potential. In this framework we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the field square $\langle \phi^{ 2}(x)\rangle_{\rm ren}$ and the renormalized vacuum average of the scalar-field's energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{\mu\nu}(x)\rangle_{\rm ren}$. Asymptotic cases are discussed in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological observables in perturbation theory turn out to be plagued with infrared divergences, which represents both a conceptual and computational challenge. In this paper we present a proof of concept for a systematic procedure to remove these divergences in a large class of scalar cosmological integrals and consistently define an infrared safe computable in perturbation theory. We provide diagrammatic rules which are based on the nestohedra underlying the asymptotic structure of such integrals.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of topological black hole in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to include the effect of high energy and topological parameters on black holes in $F(R)$ gravity, we consider two corrections to this gravity: energy-dependent spacetime with different topological constants, and a nonlinear electrodynamics field. In other words, we combine $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow with ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics theory to see the effects of high energy and topological parameters on the physics of black holes. For this purpose, we first extract topological black hole solutions in $F(R)$% -ModMax gravity's rainbow. Then, by considering black holes as thermodynamic systems, we obtain thermodynamic quantities and check the first law of thermodynamics. The effect of the topological parameter on the Hawking temperature and the total mass of black holes is obvious. We also discuss the thermodynamic topology of topological black holes in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow using the off-shell free energy method. In this formalism, black holes are assumed to be equivalent to defects in their thermodynamic spaces. For our analysis, we consider two different types of thermodynamic ensembles. These are: fixed $q$ ensemble and fixed $\phi$ ensemble. We take into account all the different types of curvature hypersurfaces that can be constructed in these black holes. The local and global topology of these black holes are studied by computing the topological charges at the defects in their thermodynamic spaces. Finally, in accordance with their topological charges, we classify the black holes into three topological classes with total winding numbers corresponding to $-1, 0$, and $1$. We observe that the topological classes of these black holes are dependent on the value of the rainbow function, the sign of the scalar curvature, and the choice of ensembles.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating scalar-tensor theory and the Qi-Xiu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the parity-violating scalar-tensor theory and pay special attention to terms that are free of the Ostrogradsky ghost in the unitary gauge, i.e., when the scalar field possesses a timelike gradient. We exhaustively identify the generally covariant scalar-tensor theory (GST) monomials with parity violation up to $d=4$, where $d$ is the total number of derivatives in the unitary gauge. According to the correspondence between GST terms and the spatially covariant gravity (SCG) terms in the unitary gauge, we also exhaustively identify the SCG monomials with parity violation up to $d=4$, where the Lie derivatives of the extrinsic curvature and the lapse function are necessarily introduced. We find a total of 9 independent parity-violating SCG monomials, of which 7 contain no higher-order Lie derivatives and are thus automatically free of ghosts, while 2 involve Lie derivatives of the extrinsic curvature and the lapse function and are thus potentially dangerous. By explicitly deriving their generally covariant correspondence, we obtain 7 independent scalar-tensor terms dubbed the ``Qi-Xiu'' Lagrangians, which are the most general parity-violating scalar-tensor theories that are ghost-free in the unitary gauge up to $d=4$. Our results include the existing theories in the literature, such as the Chern-Simons term and the chiral scalar-tensor theories, as special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft hairs are intrinsically infrared features of a black hole, which may also affect near-horizon physics. In this work, we study one of the primary observables through which we can study the effects of a particular type of soft hair in Einstein's gravity: the shadow of a non-rotating black hole implanted with linear {\it regular} superrotational hair. We show that such soft hairs deform the shadow from the characteristic circular shape of bald Schwarzschild black holes into ellipses. Such a unique effect can be observed in future black hole imaging projects. This starkly contrasts with the supertranslated counterpart, for which the only changes are the static shift of the circular shadow's position and thus cannot be detectable. Our results demonstrate the richness of observable effects due to the infrared structures of Einstein's gravity.</description>

Abstract: We propose mixed boundary conditions for 3d conformal gravity consistent with variational principle in its second-order formalism that admit the chiral $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra as their asymptotic symmetry algebra. This algebra is one of the four chiral $\mathcal W$-algebra extensions of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$ and is a generalisation of the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra responsible for soft theorems of graviton MHV amplitudes in ${\mathbb R}^{1,3}$ gravity to the case of non-zero negative cosmological constant. The corresponding charges calculated using the modified covariant phase space formalism are shown to be finite and integrable, and realise this non-linear ${\cal W}$-algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models are developed for the motion of charge-2 Abelian Higgs vortices through the 2-vortex moduli space $M$, with the vortices excited by their shape mode oscillations. The models simplify to the well-known geodesic flow on $M$, modified by a potential, when the mode oscillations are fast relative to the moduli space motion and their amplitudes are small. When the lowest-frequency mode is excited with a large amplitude, the geodesic flow is not a correct description. Instead, a chaotic, or even fractal, multi-bounce structure in vortex-vortex collisions is predicted.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Duality in 4D Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: U-duality imposes strong constraints on the structure of divergences in supergravity. But Gaillard-Zumino Sp$(2n_v, \mathbb{R})$ duality in 4D, where $n_v$ is the number of vectors, has more symmetries than U-duality. For example, in maximal supergravity, dimension of Sp(56) is 1596, whereas its U-duality subgroup $E_{7(7)}$, has dimension 133. In comparison, D $&gt; 4$ maximal dualities are U-dualities. We argue that the extra dualities in 4D, enhancing U-duality, determine the properties of perturbative quantum supergravity. The presence/absence of enhanced dualities suggests a possible explanation of known amplitude loop computations in D-dimensional supergravities.</description>

      <title>All-Loop Geometry for Four-Point Correlation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we consider a positive geometry conjectured to encode the loop integrand of four-point stress-energy correlators in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. Beginning with four lines in twistor space, we characterize a positive subspace to which an $\ell$-loop geometry is attached. The loop geometry then consists of $\ell$ lines in twistor space satisfying positivity conditions among themselves and with respect to the base. Consequently, the \textit{loop geometry} can be viewed as fibration over a \textit{tree geometry}. The fibration naturally dissects the base into chambers, in which the degree-$4 \ell$ loop form is unique and distinct for each chamber. Interestingly, up to three loops, the chambers are simply organized by the six ordering of $x^2_{12}x^2_{34}$, $x^2_{14}x^2_{23}$ and $x^2_{13}x^2_{24}$. We explicitly verify our conjecture by computing the loop-forms in terms of a basis of planar conformal integrals up to $\ell=3$, which indeed yield correct loop integrands for the four-point correlator.</description>

      <title>Interacting Fields at Spatial Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of massive fields extrapolated to the blowup of spatial infinity ($\hat{i}^0$), extending the program initiated in arXiv:2207.06406. In the free theory, we find an explicit representation of boundary two-point functions and boundary to bulk two-point functions, and also present an HKLL-type reconstruction formula for local bulk operators in terms of smeared boundary operators. We study interacting Wightman correlators and find that, generically, interacting massive fields decay slower than free fields as one approaches $\hat{i}^0$. We propose that meaningful correlators at $\hat{i}^0$ can be obtained through an LSZ-like prescription that isolates the on-shell part of bulk Wightman correlators before extrapolating them to $\hat{i}^0$. We show that a natural basis for operators at $\hat{i}^0$, defined via this prescription, is given by the average of "in" and "out" operators defined at $i^-$ and $i^+$ respectively. Therefore, correlators at $\hat{i}^0$ and cross correlators between $\hat{i}^0$, $i^-$ and $i^+$ can be represented within the class of asymptotic observables studied by Caron-Huot et al. in arXiv:2308.02125. We present several sample calculations.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of Infinite Distance Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Emergent String Conjecture constrains the possible types of light towers in infinite-distance limits in quantum gravity moduli spaces. In this paper, we use these constraints to restrict the geometry of the scalar charge-to-mass vectors $(-\vec{\nabla}\log m)$ of the light towers and the analogous vector $(-\vec{\nabla}\log\Lambda_{\text{QG}})$ of the species scale. We derive taxonomic rules that these vectors must satisfy in each duality frame. Under certain assumptions, this allows us to classify the ways in which different duality frames can fit together globally in the moduli space in terms of a finite list of polytopes. Many of these polytopes arise in known string theory compactifications, while others suggest either undiscovered corners of the landscape or new swampland constraints.</description>

      <title>Harmonic $1$-forms on real loci of Calabi-Yau manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study whether there exist nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-forms on the real locus of some carefully constructed examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds, which would then give rise to potentially new examples of $G_2$-manifolds and an explicit description of their metrics. We do this in two steps: first, we use a neural network to compute an approximate Calabi-Yau metric on each manifold. Second, we use another neural network to compute an approximately harmonic $1$-form with respect to the approximate metric, and then inspect the found solution. On two manifolds existence of a nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-form can be ruled out using differential geometry. The real locus of a third manifold is diffeomorphic to $S^1 \times S^2$, and our numerics suggest that when the Calabi-Yau metric is close to a singular limit, then it admits a nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-form. We explain how such an approximate solution could potentially be used in a numerically verified proof for the fact that our example manifold must admit a nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-form.</description>

      <title>Shock Wave Formation in Radiative Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temporal evolution of weak shocks in radiative media is theoretically investigated in this work. The structure of radiative shocks has traditionally been studied in a stationary framework. Their systematic classification is complex because layers of optically thin and thick regions alternate to form a radiatively-driven precursor and a temperature-relaxation layer, between which the hydrodynamic shock is embedded. In this work, we analyze the formation of weak shocks when two radiative plasmas with different pressures are put in contact. Applying a reductive perturbative method yields a Burgers-type equation that governs the temporal evolution of the perturbed variables including the radiation field. The conditions upon which optically thin and thick solutions exist have been derived and expressed as a function of the shock strength and Boltzmann number. Below a certain Boltzmann number threshold, weak shocks always become optically thick asymptotically in time, while thin solutions appear as transitory structures. The existence of an optically thin regime is related to the presence of an overdense layer in the compressed material. Scaling laws for the characteristic formation time and shock width are provided for each regime. The theoretical analysis is supported by FLASH simulations, and a comprehensive test-case has been designed to benchmark radiative hydrodynamic codes.</description>

      <title>NLO friction in symmetry restoring phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between bubbles/domain walls and the surrounding medium are a topic of active research, particularly as they apply to friction effects on accelerated expansion during first-order phase transitions. In this paper, we analyze for the first time friction pressure on relativistic walls in phase transitions where gauge symmetry is restored, particularly motivated by the observation that this pressure can, in principle, be negative at leading order, since some particles lose mass by definition as they cross into the new phase. We find, however, that at NLO, the soft emission of vectors from a charged current leads to positive pressure scaling as the wall's Lorentz boost factor $\gamma_w$, similar to the case of gauge symmetry breaking. Contrary to the latter case, we find that the dominant contribution in single emission is safe from IR divergences and exhibits a much stronger dependence on the wall shape. Finally, we argue that in any phase transition, no multi-particle process on the wall can impart negative pressure greater than the leading order result, in the asymptotic limit of large velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the discontinuities of banana integrals using the dispersion relation iteratively. We find a series of identities between the parameterized discontinuities of banana integrals (p-DOBIs). Similar to elliptic integrals, these identities enable the reduction of various p-DOBIs to be a linear combination of some fundamental ones. We present a practical application of p-DOBIs for the massive three-loop case and establish the expression of generalized dispersion relation, which enables us to obtain the dispersion relation representation of arbitrary banana integrals. Moreover, we propose a hypothesis for generalized dispersion relation and p-DOBIs, which provides a simple way to calculate the discontinuities and transform dispersion relation representation to p-DOBIs.</description>

      <title>Yangian for cotangent Lie algebras and spectral $R$-matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a canonical quantization of Lie bialgebra structures on the formal power series $\mathfrak{d}[\![t]\!]$ with coefficients in the cotangent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d} = T^*\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g} \ltimes \mathfrak{g}^*$ to a simple complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that these quantizations produce twists to the natural analog of the Yangian for $\mathfrak{d}$. Moreover, we construct spectral $R$-matrices for these twisted Yangians as compositions of twisting matrices.
  The motivation for the construction of these twisted Yangians over $\mathfrak{d}$ comes from certain 4d holomorphic-topological gauge theory. More precisely, we show that pertubative line operators in this theory can be realized as representations of these Yangians. Moreover, the comultiplications of these Yangians correspond to the monodial structure of the category of line operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the dramatic rise of the usage of AI algorithms in pure mathematics and fundamental sciences such as theoretical physics. This is perhaps counter-intuitive since mathematical sciences require the rigorous definitions, derivations, and proofs, in contrast to the experimental sciences which rely on the modelling of data with error-bars. In this Perspective, we categorize the approaches to mathematical discovery as "top-down", "bottom-up" and "meta-mathematics", as inspired by historical examples. We review some of the progress over the last few years, comparing and contrasting both the advances and the short-comings in each approach. We argue that while the theorist is in no way in danger of being replaced by AI in the near future, the hybrid of human expertise and AI algorithms will become an integral part of theoretical discovery.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new framework for the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for a closed, rational spin chain with $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry for any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Starting the nesting process by removing a single simple root from $\mathfrak{g}$, we use the residual $U(1)$ charge and the block Gauss decomposition of the $R$-matrix to derive many standard results in the Bethe ansatz, such as the nesting of Yangian algebras, and the AB commutation relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When gravitational waves travel from their source to an observer, they interact with matter structures along their path, causing distinct deformations in their waveforms. In this study we introduce a novel theoretical framework for wave optics effects in gravitational lensing, addressing the limitations of existing approaches. We achieve this by incorporating the proper time technique, typically used in field theory studies, into gravitational lensing. This approach allows us to extend the standard formalism beyond the eikonal and paraxial approximations, which are traditionally assumed, and to account for polarization effects, which are typically neglected in the literature. We demonstrate that our method provides a robust generalization of conventional approaches, including them as special cases. Our findings enhance our understanding of gravitational wave propagation, which is crucial for accurately interpreting gravitational wave observations and extracting unbiased information about the lenses from the gravitational wave waveforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a topological-holomorphic twist of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory on a four-manifold of the form $M_4=\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2$ with Riemann surfaces $\Sigma_{1,2}$, and unravel the mathematical implications of its physics. In particular, we consider different linear combinations of the resulting scalar supercharges under $S$-duality, where this will allow us to derive novel topological and holomorphic invariants of $M_4$ and their Langlands duals. As the twisted theory can be topological along $\Sigma_1$ whence we can dimensionally reduce it to 2d, via the effective sigma-model on $\Sigma_2$, we can also relate these 4d invariants and their Langlands duals to the mirror symmetry of Higgs bundles and that of quasi-topological strings described by the sheaf of chiral differential operators. As an offshoot, we would be able to obtain a fundamental understanding from 4d gauge theory, why chiral differential operators are purely perturbative objects.</description>

      <title>State-independent Black Hole Interiors from the Crossed Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opinion is divided about the nature of state dependence in the black hole interior. Some argue that it is a necessary feature, while others argue it is a bug. In this paper, we consider the extended half-sided modular translation $U(s_0)$ (with $s_0 &gt; 0$) of Leutheusser and Liu that takes us inside the horizon. We note that we can use this operator to construct a modular Hamiltonian $H$ and a conjugation $J$ on the infalling time-evolved wedges. The original thermofield double translates to a new cyclic and separating vector in the shifted algebra. We use these objects and the Connes cocycle to repeat Witten's crossed product construction in this new setting, and to obtain a Type II$_\infty$ algebra that is independent of the various choices, in particular that of the cyclic separating vector. Our emergent times are implicitly boundary-dressed. But if one admits an ``extra'' observer in the interior, we argue that the (state-independent) algebra can be Type I or Type II$_1$ instead of Type II$_\infty$, depending on whether the observer's light cone contains an entire Cauchy slice or not. Along with these general considerations, we present some specific calculations in the setting of the Poincare BTZ black hole. We identify a generalization of modular translations in BTZ-Kruskal coordinates that is pointwise (as opposed to non-local) and is analytically tractable, exploiting a connection with the covering AdS-space. These evolutions can reach the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use commutativity of null-integrated operators on the same null plane to construct dispersive CFT sum rules for spinning operators. The contribution of heavy blocks to these sum rules is dominated by a saddle configuration that we call the "scattering crystal." Correlators in this configuration have a natural flat-space interpretation, which allows us to build a dictionary between dispersive CFT sum rules for stress-tensors and flat-space dispersion relations for gravitons. This dictionary is a crucial step for establishing the HPPS conjecture for stress tensor correlators.</description>

Abstract: We consider the 4-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ Lie superconformal algebra and search for completely "symmetric" (in the graded sense) 3-index invariant tensors. The solution we find is unique and we show that the corresponding invariant polynomial cubic in the generalized curvatures of superconformal gravity vanishes. Consequently, the associated Chern-Simons polynomial is a non-trivial anomaly cocycle. We explicitly compute this cocycle to all orders in the independent fields of superconformal gravity and establish that it is BRST equivalent to the so-called superconformal $a$-anomaly. We briefly discuss the possibility that the superconformal $c$-anomaly also admits a similar Chern-Simons formulation and the potential holographic, 5-dimensional, interpretation of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds and its novel Atiyah-Floer correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures of Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

      <title>One-loop Bern-Carrasco-Johansson Numerators on Quadratic Propagators from the Worldsheet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for deriving one-loop Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) numerators and reveal the worldsheet origin of the one-loop double copy. Our work shows that expanding Cachazo-He-Yuan half-integrands into generalized Parke-Taylor factors intrinsically generates BCJ numerators on quadratic propagators satisfying Jacobi identities. We validate our methodology by successfully reproducing one-loop BCJ numerators for Non-Linear Sigma Model as well as those of pure Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions with all-plus or single-minus helicities.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic CFTs have central charges c = 8$\mathbb{N}$: a proof based on the MLDE approach and Rademacher series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a simple and elementary proof that meromorphic conformal field theories (CFTs) have central charges of the form: $c=8N$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}$ (the set of natural numbers) using the modular linear differential equations (MLDEs) approach. We first set up the 1-character MLDE for arbitrary value of the Wronskian index: $\ell$. From this we get the general form of the meromorphic CFT's character. We then study its modular transformations and the asymptotic value of it's Fourier coefficients -- using Rademacher series -- to conclude that odd values of $\ell$ make the character in-admissible implying that the central charge for admissible character has to be a multiple of 8.</description>

      <title>Path integral derivation of the thermofield double state in causal diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we follow the framework given in the article {\it Physica A}, \textbf{158}, pg 58-63 (1989) by R. Laflamme to derive the thermofield double state for a causal diamond using the Euclidean path integral formalism, and subsequently derive the causal diamond temperature. The interpretation of the physical and fictitious system in the thermofield double state arises naturally from the boundary conditions of the fields defined on the Euclidean sections of the cylindrical background geometry $S^{1}_{\beta}\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\beta$ defines the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate and $S^{1}_{\beta}$ is a circumference of length $\beta$. The temperature detected by a static diamond observer at $x=0$ matches with the thermofield double temperature derived via this path integral procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently shown that (near-)extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of small higher-derivative corrections to general relativity. In particular, these corrections produce diverging tidal forces on the horizon in the extremal limit. We show that adding a black hole charge makes this effect qualitatively stronger. Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Newman solution produce tidal forces that scale inversely in the black hole temperature. We find that, unlike the Kerr case, for realistic values of the black hole charge large tidal forces can arise before quantum corrections due to the Schwarzian mode become important, so that the near-horizon behavior of the black hole is dictated by higher-derivative terms in the effective theory.</description>

Abstract: We show how methods of number theory can be used to study anomalies in gauge quantum field theories in spacetime dimension two. To wit, the anomaly cancellation conditions for the abelian part of the local anomaly admit solutions if and only if they admit solutions in the reals and in the $p$-adics for every prime $p$ and we use this to build an algorithm to find all solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a novel BPS jumping phenomenon of 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories whose brane configuration is equipped with an O$7$-plane. The study of the relation between O$7{}^+$-plane and O$7{}^-$-plane reveals that such BPS jumps take place when the Higgsing is triggered near the O7-plane upon a particular parameter tuning of the theories. We propose two types of gauge theories whose BPS spectra jump. One is the SU($2N+8$) gauge theory with a symmetric hypermultiplet converted to the SU($2N$) gauge theory with an antisymmetric hypermultiplet. The other is pure SO($2N+8$) gauge theory jumping to pure Sp($N$) gauge theory. We explicitly confirm our proposal through the (un)refined instanton partition functions. Furthermore, we discuss feasible generalizations involving an O$p$-plane for supersymmetric gauge theories of eight supercharges in four and three dimensions ($p=6, 5$ respectively).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying the quantum field theoretic perturbiner approach to Einstein gravity, we compute the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole order by order in perturbation theory. Using recursion, this calculation can be carried out in de Donder gauge to all orders in Newton's constant. The result is a geometric series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a Schwarzschild black hole. It thus provides a first all-order perturbative computation in Einstein gravity with a matter source, and this series converges to the known non-perturbative expression in the expected range of convergence.</description>

Abstract: We consider an orthogonal polynomial formulation of the double scaling limit of multicritical matrix models in the $\beta=1$ Dyson-Wigner class. They capture the physics of 2D quantum gravity coupled to minimal matter on unorientable surfaces, otherwise called unoriented minimal strings. We derive a formula for the density of states valid to all orders in perturbation theory. We show how to define an interpolation between the multicritical models and that a certain interpolation among an infinite number of them provides an alternative definition of unoriented JT gravity. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our formulation.</description>

      <title>More on Black Holes Perceiving the Dark Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the field theory limit. One of the problems arises from the field theory side and is due to previous results for $\rho$ that, according to our analysis, turn out to be incorrect, although widely spread. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are inconsistent, actually based on arguments deprived of physical meaning, providing further support to our findings. We conclude by discussing ideas on the physical mechanism that could trigger the suppression of large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the perturbative generation of the gauge invariant effective action for the non-Abelian gauge field in a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime. We present a detailed analysis of the two, three and four-point functions in order to determine the non-Abelian Chern-Simons terms (parity odd) and Yang-Mills terms (parity even). Moreover, these terms are supplemented by the higher-derivative corrections which resulted in the Alekseev-Arbuzov-Baikov effective action (parity even) plus the higher-derivative (HD) corrections to the Chern-Simons terms (parity odd). In order to highlight some features about the perturbative generation of the effective action, we present a discussion based on the dimensional analysis, which allows us to establish the general structure of the permissible terms to guarantee the gauge invariance of the higher-derivative parts.</description>

      <title>The metamorphosis of semi-classical mechanisms of confinement: From monopoles on ${\mathbb R}^3 \times S^1$ to center-vortices on ${\mathbb R}^2 \times T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two distinct regimes of Yang-Mills theory where we can demonstrate confinement, the existence of a mass gap, and fractional theta angle dependence using a reliable semi-classical calculation. The two regimes are Yang-Mills theory on $S^1 \times {\mathbb R}^3$ with a small circle and a double-trace deformation, and Yang-Mills theory on $T^2 \times {\mathbb R}^2$ where the torus $T^2$ is small and threaded by a 't Hooft flux. In the first case the confinement mechanism is related to self-dual monopoles, whereas in the second case self-dual center-vortices play a crucial role. These two topological objects are distinct. In particular, they have different mutual statistics with Wilson loops. On the other hand, they carry the same topological charge and action. On ${\mathbb R \times T^2 \times S^1}$, we are able to extrapolate both monopole regime and vortex regime to a quantum mechanical domain, where a cross-over takes place. Both sides of the cross-over are described by a deformed $\mathbb Z_N$ TQFT. On ${\mathbb R^2 \times S^1 \times S^1}$, we derive the effective field theory of vortices from the effective theory of monopoles in the presence of a 't Hooft flux. This results from a two-stage adjoint Higgs mechanism, to $U(1)^{N-1}$ in 3d first and a $\mathbb Z_N$ EFT in 2d second. This proves adiabatic continuity of the two confinement mechanisms across dimensions and shows how monopoles and their magnetic flux transmute into center-vortices. This basic mechanism is flux fractionalization: The magnetic flux of the monopoles fractionalizes and collimates in such a way that 2d Wilson loops detect it as a center vortex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1904.01048v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a family of models of particle and energy diffusion on a one-dimensional lattice, related to those studied previously in [Sasamoto-Wadati], [Barraquand-Corwin] and [Povolotsky] in the context of KPZ universality class. We show that they may be mapped onto an integrable $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ Heisenberg spin chain whose Hamiltonian density in the bulk has been already studied in the AdS/CFT and the integrable system literature. Using the quantum inverse scattering method, we study various new aspects, in particular we identify boundary terms, modeling reservoirs in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics models, for which the spin chain (and thus also the stochastic process) continues to be integrable. We also show how the construction of a "dual model" of probability theory is possible and useful. The fluctuating hydrodynamics of our stochastic model corresponds to the semiclassical evolution of a string that derives from correlation functions of local gauge invariant operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM), in imaginary-time. As any stochastic system, it has a supersymmetric completion that encodes for the thermal equilibrium theorems: we show that in this case it is equivalent to the $\mathfrak{sl}(2|1)$ superstring that has been derived directly from $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a massless, minimally coupled scalar field in a $(1+1)$ dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime. In particular, one of the detectors, corresponding to $Alice$, is moving along an outgoing null trajectory. While the other detector carried by $Bob$ is static. With this set-up, we investigate the entangling condition and the measure of the entanglement, concurrence, in the nonextremal and extremal scenarios. Our observations suggest, as expected, a qualitative similarity in characteristics of the entanglement between these two scenarios. However, we find quantitative differences between the nonextremal and extremal concurrences for a broad range of black hole charges. With moderately large detector transition energy, the extremal background always accounts for the larger entanglement than the nonextremal one. In contrast, with low detector transition energy, entanglement on the nonextremal background can be greater. Therefore, by adjusting the detector transition energy, one can perceive optimum entanglement from either the extremal or the nonextremal background.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a notion of local level spacings and study their statistics within a random-matrix-theory approach. In the limit of infinite-dimensional random matrices, we determine universal sequences of mean local spacings and of their ratios which uniquely identify the global symmetries of a quantum system and its internal -- chaotic or regular -- dynamics. These findings, which offer a new framework to monitor single- and many-body quantum systems, are corroborated by numerical experiments performed for zeros of the Riemann zeta function, spectra of irrational rectangular billiards and many-body spectra of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality with emergent symmetry in the extended Shastry-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the novel phenomena observed in the layered material $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$, the Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM) has been extensively studied as the minimal model for $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$. However, the nature of its quantum phase transition from the plaquette valence-bond solid (PVBS) to antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is under fierce debate, posing a challenge to understand the underlying quantum criticality. Via the state-of-the-art tensor network simulations, we study the ground state of the SSM on large-scale size up to $20 \times 20$ sites. We identify the continuous transition nature accompanied by an emergent O(4) symmetry between the PVBS and AFM phase, which strongly suggests a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP). Furthermore, we map out the phase diagram of an extended SSM that can be continuously tuned to the SSM, which demonstrates the same DQCP phenomena along a whole critical line. Our results indicate a compelling scenario for understanding the origin of the proposed proximate DQCP in recent experiments of $\rm SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$.</description>

      <title>Open/closed Correspondence and Extended LG/CY Correspondence for Quintic Threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Walcher's disk potential for the quintic threefold can be represented as a central charge of a specific Gauged Linear Sigma Model which we call the extended quintic GLSM. This representation provides an open/closed correspondence for the quintic threefold since the central charge is a generating function of closed genus-zero GLSM invariants. We also explain how open Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence and open mirror symmetry for the quintic are compatible with wall-crossing and mirror symmetry of the extended GLSM, respectively.</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from preheating with scale dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the formalism to calculate non-Gaussianity of primordial curvature perturbations produced by preheating in the presence of a light scalar field. The calculation is carried out in the separate universe approximation using the non-perturbative delta N formalism and lattice field theory simulations. Initial conditions for simulations are drawn from a statistical ensemble determined by modes that left the horizon during inflation, with the time-dependence of Hubble rate during inflation taken into account. Our results show that cosmic variance, i.e., the contribution from modes with wavelength longer than the size of the observable universe today, plays a key role in determining the dominant contribution. We illustrate our formalism by applying it to an observationally-viable preheating model motivated by non-minimal coupling to gravity, and study its full parameter dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear extensions of classical Maxwell's electromagnetism are among the prominent candidates for theories admitting regular black hole solutions. A quest for such examples has been fruitful, but mostly unsystematic and littered by the introduction of physically unrealistic Lagrangians. We provide a procedure which admits the reconstruction of a nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian, consistent with the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian in the weak-field limit, from a given metric representing a regular, magnetically charged black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove analytic bounds on the equation of state of a cosmological fluid composed of an arbitrary number of canonical scalars evolving in a negative multi-exponential potential. Because of the negative energy, the universe is contracting and eventually undergoes a big crunch. A contracting universe is a fundamental feature of models of ekpyrosis and cyclic universes, which are a proposed alternative to cosmic inflation to solve the flatness and horizon problems. Our analytic bounds set quantitative constraints on general effective theories of ekpyrosis. When applied to specific top-down constructions, our bounds can be used to determine whether ekpyrosis could in principle be realized. We point out some possible sources of tension in realizing the ekpyrotic universe in controlled constructions of string theory.</description>

      <title>Extended Baxter relations and QQ-systems for quantum affine algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Baxter's TQ-relations and the QQ-system are systems of algebraic relations in the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of the quantum affine algebra U_q(g^), which we established in our earlier works arXiv:1308.3444 and arXiv:1606.05301. In the present paper, we conjecture a family of analogous relations labeled by elements of the Weyl group W of g, so that the original relations correspond to the identity element. These relations are closely connected to the W-symmetry of q-characters established in arXiv:2211.09779. We prove these relations for all w in W if g has rank two, and we prove the extended TQ-relations if w is a simple reflection. We also generalize our results and conjectures to the shifted quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Black Hole Quasinormal Ringdown Formalism for Higher Overtones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parametrized black hole quasinormal ringdown formalism, which is a robust framework used to analyze quasinormal modes in systems that closely resemble general relativity, paying particular attention to the higher overtones. We find that larger deviations from the general relativity case typically appear in the quasinormal frequencies for the higher overtones. This growing tendency for higher overtones can be understood using an analytical method, and its relations to previous works are briefly discussed. Our findings indicate that we can impose a strong constraint on gravity theories by considering the overtones of quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Well-defined $f(Q)$ Gravity, Reconstruction of FLRW Spacetime and Unification of Inflation with Dark Energy Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the convenient and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravities in terms of the metric and four scalar fields with the $Q$ being the non-metricity scalar. As a result, it is shown that the obtained field equations are well-defined. By using the field equations, we show how the $f(Q)$ models which realise any given FLRW spacetime may be reconstructed. We construct convenient $f(Q)$ gravity and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravity, which describe the inflation and dark energy epochs and even unify the inflation and dark energy. Moreover, a radiation-dominated epoch and early dark energy may be easily included in the above theories as is explicitly shown. It is shown that the inflationary spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with Planck data for some models of $f(Q)$ gravity. Corresponding asymptotic forms of $f(Q)$ and mimetic $f(Q)$ are given. Finally, some remarks on possible reconstruction for spherically symmetric spacetime are given.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: exact analysis through theory of block Toeplitz determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are usually significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$ block) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. As a result, the constants $E(a)$ and $E(\tilde a)$ for the large $n$ asymptotics still allow explicit representations that generalize the strong Szeg\"o's theorem for scalar symbols. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, ``logarithmic divergences'' in the Wiener-Hopf factors generate certain ``anomalous terms'' in the exponential form factor expansions of the re-scaled correlators. Since our boundaries in the naive scaling limits can be formulated as certain integrable boundaries/defects in 2D massive QFTs, the results of this work facilitate detailed comparisons with bootstrap approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toric Ricci--flat metrics in dimension four correspond to certain holomorphic vector bundles over a twistor space. We construct these bundles explicitly, by exhibiting and characterising their patching matrices, for the five--parameter family of Riemannian ALF metrics constructed by Chen and Teo. The Chen--Teo family contains a two--parameter family of asymptotically flat gravitational instantons. The patching matrices for these instantons take a simple rational form.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in magnetized black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Comisso-Asenjo mechanism is a novel mechanism proposed recently to extract energy from black holes through magnetic reconnection of the surrounding charged plasma, in which the magnetic field plays a crucial role. In this work, we revisit this process by taking into account the backreaction of the magnetic field on the black hole's geometry. We employ the Kerr-Melvin metric to describe the local near-horizon geometry of the magnetized black hole. By analyzing the circular orbits in the equatorial plane, energy extraction conditions, power and efficiency of the energy extraction, we found that while a stronger magnetic field can enhance plasma magnetization and aid energy extraction, its backreaction on the spacetime may hinder the process, with a larger magnetic field posing a greater obstacle. Balancing these effects, an optimal moderate magnetic field strength is found to be most conducive to energy extraction. Moreover, there is a maximum limit to the magnetic field strength associated with the black hole's spin, beyond which circular orbits in the equatorial plane are prohibited, thereby impeding energy extraction in the current scenario.</description>
