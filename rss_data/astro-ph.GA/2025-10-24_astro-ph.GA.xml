      <title>The long-term effects of gas removal from hydrodynamic simulations of star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The removal of gas left over from star formation has long been thought to dominate the dynamical evolution, and dissolution of star-forming regions. Feedback from massive stars from their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernovae is postulated to expel significant amounts of gas, altering the gravitational potential energy of the star-forming region and causing a supervirial expansion, which disperses the stars into the Galaxy on rapid timescales (&lt;10Myr). The majority of previous work has utilised N-body simulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal. Here, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback from massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also scale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or faster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We find that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink particles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a simulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we would expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the dynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities directly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with (sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback processes does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the expansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>The Synthetic Absorption Line Spectral Almanac (SALSA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We create the first large-scale mock spectroscopic survey of gas absorption sightlines traversing the interstellar medium (ISM), circumgalactic medium (CGM), and intergalactic medium (IGM) surrounding galaxies of virtual Universes. That is, we create mock, or synthetic, absorption spectra by drawing lines-of-sight through cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, using a new mesh-free Voronoi ray-tracing algorithm. The result is the Synthetic Absorption Line Spectral Almanac (SALSA), which is publicly released on a feature-rich online science platform (www.tng-project.org/spectra). It spans a range of ions, transitions, instruments, observational characteristics, assumptions, redshifts, and simulations. These include, but are not limited to: (ions) HI, OI, CI, MgI, MgII, FeII, SiII, CaII, ZnII, SiIII, SiIV, NV, CII, CIV, OVI; (instruments) SDSS-BOSS, KECK-HIRES, UVES, COS, DESI, 4MOST, WEAVE, XSHOOTER; (model choices) with/without dust depletion, noise, quasar continua, foregrounds; (redshift) from z=0 to z~6; (ancillary data) integrated equivalent widths, column densities, distances and properties of nearby galaxies; (simulations) IllustrisTNG including TNG50, TNG-Cluster, EAGLE, and SIMBA. This scope is not fixed, and will grow and evolve with community interest and requests over time -- suggestions are welcome. The resulting dataset is generic and broadly applicable, enabling diverse science goals such as: (i) studies of the underlying physical gas structures giving rise to particular absorption signatures, (ii) galaxy-absorber and halo-absorber correlations, (iii) virtual surveys and survey strategy optimization, (iv) stacking experiments and the identification of faint absorption features, (v) assessment of data reduction methods and completeness calculations, (vi) inference of physical properties from observables, and (vii) apples-to-apples comparisons between simulations and data.</description>

      <title>The role of galactic winds fueling central starbursts and quasars in the FIRE cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central starbursts and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to be fueled by either galaxy interactions or secular processes in gravitationally unstable discs. We employ cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project to propose a new nuclear fueling scenario based on the transition that galaxies undergo from bursty to smooth star formation and from prominent global galactic winds to inefficient stellar feedback as they grow above $M_{\star}\sim 10^{10-10.5}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$: the last major galactic wind event shuts down star formation, evacuates gas from the galaxy, and slows down gas accretion from the circumgalactic medium (CGM), creating a $\sim$$10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ pileup of gas in the inner CGM which later accretes coherently onto the galaxy, achieving a tenfold increase in inflow rate over pre-outflow conditions. We explicitly track the accumulation of gas along the outflow pathway owing to hydrodynamic interactions and show that $\sim$50% of gas fueling the central $\sim$10-100$\,{\rm pc}$ over the subsequent $\sim$15$\,{\rm Myr}$ can be traced back to pileup gas having experienced $&gt;$50% change in infall velocity owing to the wind interaction. This galactic wind pileup effect may thus represent a significant fueling mode for compact starbursts and luminous AGN. Galactic winds at earlier times or AGN-driven outflows can have qualitatively similar effects, but the pileup of gas driven by the last major galactic wind event refuels the galaxy precisely when the deepening stellar potential prevents further gas evacuation by stellar feedback, providing the ideal conditions for quasar fueling at the time when AGN feedback is most needed to regulate central star formation in massive galaxies at their peak of activity.</description>

      <title>The Sagittarius C Complex in the Mid-Infrared with SOFIA/FORCAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-resolution mid-infrared observations at 25 and 37 $\mu m$ of the Sagittarius C Complex (Sgr C) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), based on data from the SOFIA/FORCAST Galactic Center Legacy Survey. Enabled by the high bright-source limit of the FORCAST instrument, we perform a map-level dust temperature and optical depth analysis with a focus on the Sgr C HII region, which has an average dust temperature of 61 K and an average 37 $\mu m$ optical depth of 0.05. We find that the Sgr C HII region contains several high-density dust emission ridges, with lengths of up to several parsecs. Noting prior evidence for nonthermal radio emission from these density ridges, we postulate that there is an enhancement of relativistic electrons within them, possibly attributable to diffusive shock acceleration induced by the wind of a known nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) star impacting the density ridges and the ambient gas in the surrounding photo-dissociation region. Additionally, the tangential magnetic field in the outskirts of the Sgr C HII region may serve to confine the electrons within this region. We examined the heating effect of the WR star by calculating its heating profile and performing a spectral energy distribution modelling of the HII region. We found an integrated MIR luminosity of $(1.40\pm0.19)\times10^{6} L_\odot$, which implies that presently unidentified massive stars must be present in the HII region in addition to the WR star. We also present a brief analysis of adjacent regions, such as a mid-infrared/radio source denoted "Source C" and the G359.43+0.02 young stellar object cluster near the northern end of the prominent Sgr C non-thermal filament (NTF).</description>

      <title>Introducing RAFIKI: Refining AGN Feedback in Kinetic Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cosmological simulations have now matured to the point of reproducing the evolution of realistic galaxy populations across cosmic time. These simulations rely on feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to quench massive galaxies, yet the details of this process remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we introduce RAFIKI (Refining AGN Feedback In Kinetic Implementations), a novel suite of simulations built upon SIMBA-C that vary the mass loading of AGN-driven winds. Unlike the fiducial SIMBA-C simulation, RAFIKI separates the efficiencies of the two kinetic feedback modes, enabling a detailed study of their impact on galaxies, black holes, and the circumgalactic medium. We explore a range of galaxy and baryon properties in the RAFIKI runs and find that even with enhanced mass loading, the lower-velocity, quasar-type mode cannot quench massive galaxies. However, it plays a significant role in regulating black hole growth and star formation in intermediate-mass galaxies. We also uncover degeneracies in the parameter space that highlight the limited current constraints on AGN feedback. RAFIKI provides a controlled framework to disentangle these degeneracies using current and upcoming observations.</description>

      <title>An accurate measure of the size of dark matter halos using the size of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physically motivated definition of galaxy size proposed recently, linked to the farther location of the in-situ star formation, considerably reduces the scatter of the galaxy mass-size relation, and provide a viable method to infer the galaxy stellar mass from its size. We provide a similar relation correlating the size of galaxies with the size of their dark matter haloes by leveraging the small scatter of the aforementioned relation. We analysed the simulated galaxies of the two main cosmological volumes of the EAGLE simulations, and computed the size of galaxies and their mass mimicking the observational analysis. For central galaxies, we computed the relation between galaxy size and halo size. We show that the simulated galaxies reproduce the observed stellar mass-size relation's normalisation and slope. The scatter of this relation, 0.06 dex, matches the intrinsic scatter measured in observation. We then computed the correlation between galaxy size and halo size, and found that the relation is steeper than when using the half-mass radius as measure of size, with the scatter (0.1 dex) a factor of two smaller than the observed relation. As well, the galaxy-to-halo mass relation derived from simulations provides a factor of two better scatter than observed. This opens the possibility of measuring the size of dark matter haloes with great accuracy (less than fifty percent, i.e. around six times better than using the effective radius) by using only deep imaging data.</description>

      <title>Tidally-induced radial migration waves in LMC-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar radial migration has predominantly been examined in isolated disc galaxies where non-axisymmetric structures drive the process. By contrast, while tidal interactions are known for having an influence, their contribution remains comparatively under explored. The LMC, the nearest disc galaxy to the Milky Way (MW) and currently interacting with the SMC, provides a unique laboratory to investigate this interplay. We aim to quantify the impact of tidal interactions on radial migration and metallicity distribution in high-resolution simulations of LMC-like disc galaxies. We leverage a subsample of KRATOS, a suite of 28 pure $N$-body simulations of the LMC-SMC-MW system. Specifically, we use 6 simulations of both isolated and interacting LMC-like galaxies, exploring different values of the Toomre stellar parameter $Q$. These simulations allow to map the evolution of the stars' guiding radii $R_g(t)$ and compute radial migration fluxes in interacting systems and compare with their isolated counterparts, allowing to quantify the link between tidal interactions, radial migration, non-axisymmetric patterns, disc internal stability, and radial metallicity distribution. We present tidally-triggered wave-like radial migration fluxes reaching up to $\sim40\%$ of disc stellar mass per Gyr. This wave-like migration appears during the satellite's pericentre passages, almost independently of $Q$ and induces a metallicity drop of $\sim$3-5\% of the isolated galaxy's maximum metallicity in the inner disc. Additionally, in the isolated simulations, the extent of variation in the bar's resonance region coincides with the mixing zones in the metallicity distribution. We propose a novel description of a wave-like radial migration flux as a dynamical response of a galaxy undergoing tidal interactions and sketch its impact on the galaxy's metallicity distribution.</description>

      <title>Targeting cluster galaxies for the 4MOST CHANCES Low-z sub-survey with photometric redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of galaxies is shaped by both internal processes and their external environments. Galaxy clusters and their surroundings provide ideal laboratories to study these effects, particularly mechanisms such as quenching and morphological transformation. The Chilean Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES) Low-z sub-survey is part of the CHileAN Cluster galaxy Evolution Survey, a 4MOST community survey designed to uncover the relationship between the formation and evolution of galaxies and hierarchical structure formation as it happens, through deep and wide multi-object spectroscopy. We present the target selection strategy followed to select galaxy cluster candidate members for the CHANCES low-z sub-survey, in and around 50 clusters and two superclusters at z&lt;0.07, out to (5XR200) and down to mr= 20.4. Combining public photometric redshift estimates from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey and T80S/S-PLUS iDR5, with custom photometric redshifts, we identify likely galaxy cluster candidate members whose photometric redshifts are consistent with being at the known redshift of the cluster and measure the average deviations of their photometric redshifts with respect to the spectroscopic redshift measurements {\sigma}NMAD. We have successfully compiled our CHANCES-low-redshift catalogues, split into three different sub-surveys: low-z bright (mr&lt;18.5), low-z faint (18.5&lt;=mr&lt;20.4) and low-z faint supplementary, by selecting&gt;= 500,000 galaxy cluster candidate members and including confirmed spectroscopic galaxy cluster members, from which we expect to obtain 4MOST low-resolution (R~6500) spectra for ~320,000 galaxies. The CHANCES Low-z target catalogues form a statistically robust sample for spectroscopic follow-up, allowing studies of galaxy evolution and environmental effects in nearby cluster and supercluster environments.</description>

      <title>Rapid, out of equilibrium metal enrichment indicated by a flat mass-metallicity relation at z~6 from NIRCam grism spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at $5&lt;z&lt;7$. Using $\sim800$ [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities ($0.1$-$0.2\,\rm Z_\odot$ for M$_\star$ $\approx5\times10^{7-9}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Understanding Interstellar Metals during Reionization with Radiative SPH Simulation: Metallicity and Emission Lines from the ISM at $10 \geq z \geq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the \texttt{Technicolor Dawn} cosmological simulations with recent observations of galactic nebular line emission during the Epoch of Reionization, providing stringent tests of the predicted ionization and metal enrichment levels. We validate the simulated population with the UVLF and $M_{\mathrm{UV}}-M_*$ relation and see that the simulated results are consistent with observations at lower masses. We extract local gas volumetric grids of density and mass-weighted metallicity, then we use \texttt{Cloudy} to produce synthetic emission spectra of \species{H}{ii} regions. The mass-metallicity relation does not evolve, which is also consistent with observations. The predicted oxygen abundance exceeds observational inferences by about 0.5 dex, suggesting either overly efficient enrichment or weak feedback. However, applying the O32 diagnostic directly to our synthetic spectra shows an offset of 1 dex from the correct outputted gas-phase metallicity. This suggests that O32 is biased high at a level that is more than sufficient to account for the simulation-observation offset. The simulated galaxies' line diagnostics show mostly weaker [\species{O}{iii}] lines and lower diagnostic values of O3 and Ne3O2 compared to observations. This suggests higher ionization parameters within the simulated galactic population in general.</description>

      <title>Photometrically Selected Protocluster Candidates at z~9-10 in the JWST COSMOS-Web field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift protoclusters are crucial for understanding the formation of galaxy clusters and the evolution of galaxies in dense environments. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity, enables the first exploration of protoclusters beyond $z&gt;$10. Among JWST surveys, COSMOS-Web Data Release 0.5 offers the largest area $\sim$0.27 deg$^2$, making it an optimal field for protocluster searches. In this study, we searched for protoclusters at $z\sim$9-10 using 366 F115W dropout galaxies. We evaluated the reliability of our photometric redshift by validation tests with the JADES DR3 spectroscopic sample, obtaining the likelihood of falsely identifying interlopers as $\sim25\%$. Overdensities ($\delta$) are computed by weighting galaxy positions with their photometric redshift probability density functions (PDF), using a 2.5 cMpc aperture and a redshift slice of $\pm$0.5. We selected the most promising core galaxies of protocluster candidate galaxies with an overdensity greater than the 95th percentile of the distribution of 366 F115W dropout galaxies. The member galaxies are then linked within an angular separation of 7.5 cMpc to the core galaxies, finding seven protocluster candidates. These seven protocluster candidates have inferred halo masses of $M_{\text{halo}} \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. The detection of such overdensities at these redshifts provides a critical test for current cosmological simulations. However, confirming these candidates and distinguishing them from low-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies or Balmer-break galaxies will require follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>The chemodynamical memory of a major merger in a NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue II: Were Splash stars heated or already born hot?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most debated consequences of the Milky Way's last major merger is the so-called $Splash$: stars with disc-like chemistry but halo-like kinematics, often interpreted as evidence for the violent heating of an early protodisc. Using the same high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological simulation analysed in Buder et al. (2025b, hereafter Paper I), we test whether, and if so how, a Splash-like population arises in the Milky Way analogue. By tracing stellar birth positions, ages, and present-day orbits, we find that protodisc stars were already born on dynamically hot orbits, with no evidence for significant additional dynamical $splashing$ of these particular in-situ stars despite a 1:5 stellar mass merger. The observed Splash may therefore reflect the already turbulent early disc, subsequently intermixed with accreted stars and those formed from merger-driven gas inflows, rather than a distinct merger-heated population. When selecting stars with similar chemistry and age as the Splash-like ones, we find their azimuthal velocity distribution to be broad and positively skewed, with $V_\varphi = 73_{-59}^{+74}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The transition to a rotation-supported disc with large azimuthal velocities occurs only during or after the merger. Our results suggest an alternative to the proposed splashing scenario and highlight the need to disentangle the relative contributions of merger-induced heating and intrinsically hot disc formation to clarify the nature of Splash-like stars and their role in shaping the early Milky Way.</description>

      <title>FAST-SBF: an automatic procedure for the measurement of Surface Brightness Fluctuations for large sky surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Surface Brightness Fluctuation method is one of the most reliable and efficient ways of measuring distances to galaxies within 100 Mpc. While recent implementations have increasingly relied on space-based observations, SBF remains effective when applied to ground-based data. In particular, deep, wide-field imaging surveys with sub-arcsecond seeing conditions allows us for accurate SBF measurements across large samples of galaxies. With the upcoming next generation wide-area imaging surveys, the thousands of galaxies suitable for SBF measurements will give us the opportunity to constrain the 3D structure of the local universe. We present FAST-SBF, a new Python-based pipeline for measuring SBF, developed to support the analysis of large datasets from upcoming wide-field imaging surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman. The procedure, still in the testing and development stage, is designed for automation and minimal user intervention, offering a fast and flexible approach to SBF distance estimation. We validate the performance of the procedure on high-quality imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), a precursor to LSST, analyzing a sample of both luminous early-type galaxies and fainter dwarfs. Our measurements are also compared with recent results from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) and with the SPoT stellar population synthesis models. The results show excellent agreement with published distances, with the capability of measuring the SBF signal also for faint dwarf galaxies. The pipeline allows the user to completely analyze a galaxy in relatively short time ($\approx$ minutes) and significantly reduces the need for user intervention. reduces at minimum the user intervention. The FAST-SBF tool is planned for public release to support the community in using SBF as a distance indicator in next-generation surveys.</description>

      <title>The effect of triaxiality on the dynamics of triple supermassive black holes in a cosmological context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hierarchical nature of galaxy formation in the {\Lambda}CDM framework often leads to multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the galactic nuclei. The timescale over which galaxies merge, plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamical evolution and the merger dynamics of their central SMBHs. While binary SMBH evolution is well studied, the long-term dynamics of triple SMBH systems, particularly in non-spherical potentials, remain less understood. We investigate the role of triaxiality in the evolution and dynamics of triple SMBHs with initial conditions drawn from the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation, using high-resolution gravitodynamical N-body simulations. We explore different orbital configurations and host shapes, tracking the evolution from galactic inspiral to hard binary formation at sub-parsec scales. In all cases, the two most massive SMBHs form a rapidly hardening binary that coalesces within a fraction of a Hubble time, while the third forms a stable hierarchical triple system with the heavier binary, or remains on a wide orbit.</description>

      <title>Strong Lensing Model and Dust Extinction Maps of the Host Galaxy of Type Ia Supernova H0pe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters offers particularly rare opportunities to observe multiple images of distant ($z\gtrsim2$) Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and resolve the properties of their host galaxies. A recent outstanding example is the Type Ia SN "H0pe" ($z=1.78$), discovered in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam images when it was still triply imaged by the galaxy cluster PLCK G165.7+67.0 (G165, $z=0.35$). In this work we build a new strong lensing model of G165, first by using only the position of multiple images of background galaxies. We then increase significantly the number of constraints around the position of SN H0pe by modeling the extended surface brightness of the SN host galaxy. The average uncertainty on mass model parameters is reduced by more than an order of magnitude. We also study the spatial distribution of dust in the arc to estimate the dust extinction at the position of SN H0pe. We find good statistical agreement of the extinction estimate at $\lesssim1\sigma$ with three fully independent methods based on spectral energy distribution fitting. Moreover, our extended-image lens model of G165 allows us to map the dust distribution of the host galaxy from the image plane to the source plane. Supernova H0pe exploded in a region with a relatively high extinction of $A_V \approx 0.9\ {\rm mag}$ at around $\sim 1\ {\rm kpc}$ from its host center. This work shows that extended image modeling in lensing clusters simultaneously reduces the uncertainty on lens model parameters and enables spatially resolved analyses of lensed transients host galaxies. Such modeling advances are expected to play an important role in future cosmological analyses using strongly lensed SNe.</description>

      <title>After 54 years of bar instability studies: a fresh surprise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known bar instability of rotationally-supported disk galaxy models has been studied extensively since its first discovery over half a century ago. We were therefore very surprised to find cases of disks embedded in rigid halos, which on the basis of widely-cited criteria should be unstable, that appeared to be robustly stable. Here we show that the unstable bar mode in such simulations was being suppressed by changes to the disk caused by other instabilities having higher angular symmetry that were the first to saturate. Although this may seem like a promising solution to the long-standing puzzle presented by the apparent stability of real disk galaxies, we also show that instability is restored in the same models when the rigid halo is replaced by a live population of particles, where the usual stability conditions apply. Our study has been confined to a narrow range of models, and we cannot therefore exclude the possibility that mode interference may be able to prevent bar formation in other models having live halos.</description>

      <title>Observationally derived change in star-formation rate as mergers progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers can change the rate at which stars are formed. We can trace when these changes occur in simulations of galaxy mergers. However, for observed galaxies we do not know how the star-formation rate (SFR) evolves along the merger sequence as it is difficult to probe the time before or after coalescence. We aim to derive how SFR changes in observed mergers throughout the merger sequence, from a statistical perspective. Merger times were estimated for observed galaxy mergers in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on mock KiDS images created using IllustrisTNG data. The SFRs were derived from spectral energy density fitting to KiDS and VIKINGs data. To determine the change in SFR for the merging galaxies, each merging galaxy was matched and compared to ten comparable non-merging galaxies; matching redshift, stellar mass, and local density. Mergers see an increase in SFR for galaxies from 300~Myr before the merger until coalescence, continuing until at least 200~Myr after the merger event. After this, there is a possibility that SFR activity in the mergers begins to decrease, but we need more data to better constrain our merger times and SFRs to confirm this. We find that more galaxies with larger stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) have greater SFR enhancement as they merge compared to lower M$_{\star}$ galaxies. There is no clear trend of changing SFR enhancement as local density changes, but the least dense environments have the least SFR enhancement. The increasing SFR enhancement is likely due to closer proximity of galaxies and the presence of more close passes as the time before merger approaches 0~Myr, with SFR slowing 200~Myr after the merger event.</description>

      <title>Black Hole-Host Galaxy Correlations with Machine Learning: A Comparative Study of Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are known to correlate with many properties of their host galaxies, but we do not fully understand these correlations. The strengths (tightness) of these correlations have also been widely debated. In this work, we explore SMBH-host relations in three state-of-the-art cosmological simulations: Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE. Using a variety of machine learning regressors, we measure the scaling relations between black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and galaxy properties including stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), dark matter halo mass ($M_{\rm Halo}$), and the Sersic index. We find that machine learning regressors provide predictive capabilities superior to linear regression in many scaling relations in simulations, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor has the strongest performance. SMBH-host relations have different strengths in different simulations as a result of their sub-grid models. Similar to the observations, the $M_{\rm BH} $-$\sigma$ relation is a strong correlation in all simulations, but in TNG, the $M_{\rm BH} $-$M_{\star}$ relation is even tighter than $M_{\rm BH} $-$\sigma$. EAGLE produces the weakest SMBH-host correlations among all simulations. Low mass SMBHs tend to be poorly correlated with their host galaxies, but including them can still help machines better grasp the correlations in Illustris and TNG. Combining galaxy properties that strongly correlate with $M_{\rm BH} $ but poorly correlate with each other can improve MLP's performance. $M_{\rm BH} $ is most accurately predicted when all galaxy properties are included in the training, suggesting that SMBH-host correlations are fundamentally multi-dimensional in these simulations.</description>

      <title>Testing the AGN Paradigm, Part I: a generic SED for Seyfert 1 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the first part of a study aimed at testing the unification paradigm for AGN (UPAGN) using the SED reconstruction code X-CIGALE. Our method consists in obtaining a generic SED for a large sample of Seyfert 1 (Sy1; part 1), then applying this SED to Seyfert 2 (Sy2; Part~II), expecting that the only difference will be the line-of-sight (LOS) angle, $i$, relative to the polar axis of the torus of gas and dust obscuring the broad line regions (BLRs). Our sample is composed of 3,896 Type 1, Sy1 at low redshifts, $ z&lt;0.4$, separated into four spectral subgroups depending on the presence or absence in their spectra of narrow emission lines, Sy1N/Sy1B, and AGN wind, Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw. The generic SED produced by X-CIGALE applies to 90\% of the Sy1 in our sample. It includes a clumpy torus with an AGN engine seen face-on ($i \sim 10^\circ \pm 5^\circ$). Our analysis not only supports the existence of a torus in Sy1, in good agreement with UPAGN, but also reveals new facts about the accretion of matter and AGN wind: 1- a sudden accretion of matter from the BLR to the accretion disk triggered the wind, 2- matter from the wind replenishes the torus, consistent with a gradual formation of this structure by recurrent AGN winds, and 3- Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw eventually evolve as AGN without wind, leaving behind a torus as evidence of a higher AGN activity in their past.</description>

      <title>Limits on Stellar Flybys in the Solar Birth Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbits of small bodies in the outer solar system are particularly sensitive to gravitational perturbations, including stellar flybys. Stellar clusters, with low velocity dispersions and high number densities, can be the source of strong and frequent flybys. As a result, we can infer what properties of the solar birth environment would be incompatible with the structure of the outer solar system observed today. Here, we explore with $n-$body simulations the implications of the low inclinations ($i &lt; 20^{\circ}$) of the distant sednoids (objects with perihelia $q &gt; 40 \mathrm{\; AU}$ and semimajor axes $a &gt; 400 \mathrm{\; AU}$) for the properties of the solar birth cluster. We find that the existence of these orbits, if they were in place in the Sun's birth cluster phase, would limit the product of the stellar number density and the Sun's residence time in the birth cluster to $\lesssim 5 \times 10^3 \mathrm{\; Myr \; pc^{-3}}$, as compared to the weaker limit $\lesssim 5 \times 10^4 \mathrm{\; Myr \; pc^{-3}}$ implied by the low inclinations of the cold classical Kuiper belt.</description>

      <title>On the Evolution of Disk-Embedded Binaries: Framing Local Models in Global Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have in recent years been recognized as possible sites for gravitational wave sources, leading to a series of numerical studies on the evolution of disk-embedded black hole binaries. The majority of these works have been carried out so far using the shearing box, a local Cartesian domain co-rotating with the binary center-of-mass around the supermassive black hole. The local nature of this framework allows for focusing computational power close to the binary at the expense of detaching the gas flow around the binary from the global dynamics. In this paper, we provide a framework to assess the applicability of the shearing box for studying the long-term evolution of the orbital elements of the embedded binary in viscous hydrodynamic disks. We accomplish this by identifying the conditions under which relevant global timescales are longer than the gas-induced evolution timescale of the embedded binary across various AGN disk models. For black hole masses of interest, we report the existence of radii beyond which the global influence of the disk may be reasonably neglected, supporting the use of the shearing box. More generally, we introduce a systematic approach to link local simulations with the global problem they aim to approximate while providing a way to gauge their accuracy. This will prove to be essential as we seek to add additional physics, such as magnetic fields and radiative transport, to develop more realistic models for black hole binary mergers and their potential electromagnetic signatures in AGN disks.</description>

      <title>Eppur non si trovano: Comments on the Primordial Black Hole Limits in the Galactic Halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent arXiv post, Hawkins &amp; Garcia-Bellido raised doubts on the results of 20-yr long OGLE photometric monitoring, which did not find a large number of gravitational microlensing events in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds. These results implied that primordial black holes and other compact objects with masses from 10^{-8} to 10^3 M_solar cannot comprise a substantial fraction of the Milky Way dark matter halo. Unfortunately, the Hawkins &amp; Garcia-Bellido post contained a number of scientific misrepresentations of our work. Here, we demonstrate that their arguments lack a solid basis or are simply incorrect. As we show below, "and yet they are not found" - compact objects (including primordial black holes) in the dark halo of the Milky Way remain undetected, despite extensive searches.</description>

      <title>XRISM/Resolve Spectroscopy of the Central Engine in the Seyfert-1 AGN Mrk 279</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM gives an unprecedented view of the ``central engine'' in active galactic nuclei, providing unique insights into black hole accretion and feedback. We present an analysis of the first XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Mrk 279, known for its complex line profiles and variability. The data reveal velocity components within the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ emission line that can be associated with the inner face of the molecular torus ($r \geq 10^{4}~GM/c^{2})$, the broad line region (BLR; $r = 1650^{+5780}_{-1480}~GM/c^{2}$), and the inner accretion disk ($r = 81^{+280}_{-75}~GM/c^{2}$). We find evidence of low-velocity, highly ionized gas that contributes an H-like Fe XXVI emission line at 6.97 keV, confirming suggestions from prior low-resolution spectra. The data do not show slow winds in absorption, but two pairs of lines - consistent with He-like and H-like Fe shifted by $v\simeq 0.22c$ and $v\simeq 0.33c$ - improve the fit, and could represent an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). Their addition to the model only reduces the Akaike Information Criterion by 3.6 and 3.5, respectively, signaling modest support. Additional observations are needed to definitively test for the presence of fast X-ray winds in Mrk 279. We discuss these results in the context of the geometry of the central engine in AGN, emerging trends in XRISM studies of AGN, and the nature of the potential UFOs.</description>

      <title>On the observation of cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing</title>

Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger constraints on LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave binary black holes merging in AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) detectors have detected over 300 binary black hole (BBH) mergers to date, the first confirmation of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to such an event remains elusive. Previous works have performed searches for counterpart candidates in transient catalogs and have identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares coincident with GW events; existing theory predicts that such flares may arise from the interaction of the merger remnant with the embedding accretion disk environment. We apply a statistical formalism to measure the significance of coincidence for the catalog as a whole, measuring that less than 3\% (90\% credible interval) of LVK BBH mergers give rise to observable AGN flares. This result still allows up to $\sim 40\%$ of BBH mergers to originate in AGN disks. We also examine the individual coincidences of each merger/flare pairing, determining that in all cases the flares are more likely to belong to a background population of flares not associated with GW events. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions accounting for the observability of EM counterparts in AGN disks, as well as based on the fact that the most massive AGNs (such as those included in the search) are not expected to harbor the majority of the BBHs. We emphasize that developing both the means to distinguish BBH counterpart flares from background AGN flares and an understanding of which BBHs are most likely to produce AGN flares as counterparts is critical to optimize the use of follow-up resources.</description>

      <title>Simulation-calibrated Bayesian inference for progenitor properties of the microquasar SS 433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SS\,433 is one of the most extreme Galactic X-ray binaries, exhibiting semi-relativistic jets and super-critical accretion, and harboring a compact object, likely a black hole. Despite decades of observation and modeling, the precise nature of its progenitor binary remains uncertain. To estimate the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) properties of binaries that evolve into SS\,433-like systems, we apply simulation-based calibration to Bayesian inference and convolve a multivariate Gaussian likelihood constructed from six measured binary parameters of SS\,433 with the isolated binary evolution model \textsc{COSMIC}. Employing the dynamic nested sampler of \texttt{dynesty}, we perform posterior inference over a ten-dimensional progenitor parameter space defined by the masses, orbital parameters, mass transfer possibilities, and natal kick velocity. We find that SS\,433-like systems arise from specific regions of binary evolution parameter space depending on key assumptions, such as the mass transfer rate and uncertainty taken from observations. Our simulation-based calibration framework, implemented with a suite of machine learning algorithms and scored by a heuristic reliability metric, allows us to iteratively build posterior distributions of the progenitors of SS\,433-like systems. This analysis reveals 90\% confidence intervals for the ZAMS primary mass $(8, 11)$ M$_\odot$, secondary mass $(32, 40)$ M$_\odot $, orbital period $(136, 2259)$ days, eccentricity $(0.26, 0.6)$, common envelope evolution efficiency $(0.44, 0.76)$, accreted fraction in stable mass transfer $(0.22, 0.6)$, and black hole natal kick velocity magnitude $(5, 68)$ km/s. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct probabilistic inference of X-ray binary progenitors to offer new insights into the evolution of high-accretion-rate systems such as SS\,433.</description>

      <title>Pushing JWST to the extremes: search and scrutiny of bright galaxy candidates at z$\simeq$15-30</title>

Abstract: We designed customized Lyman-break color selection techniques to identify galaxy candidates in the redshift ranges $15 \leq z \leq 20$ and $20 \leq z \leq 28$. The selection was performed on the ASTRODEEP-JWST multi-band catalogs of the CEERS, Abell-2744, JADES, NGDEEP, and PRIMER survey fields, covering a total area of $\sim0.2$ sq. deg. We identify five candidates at $15 \leq z \leq 20$, while no objects are found based on the $z\gtrsim20$ color selection criteria. Despite exhibiting a $&gt;$1.5 mag break, all the objects display multimodal redshift probability distributions across different SED-fitting codes and methodologies. The alternative solutions correspond to poorly understood populations of low-mass quiescent or dusty galaxies at z$\sim$3-7. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of five F200W-dropout objects that we find to be interlopers on the basis of NIRSpec PRISM spectra: four dusty star-forming galaxies at z$\sim$2.2-6.6, and a passive galaxy at z=4.91 with log$(M_{\rm star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) \lesssim$ 9. We measured the UV luminosity function under different assumptions on the contamination level within our sample. We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed at $z\gtrsim15$, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared to estimates at $z&lt;15$, implying a significant tension with existing theoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright ($M_{\text{UV}}&lt;-21$) candidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In turn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude that future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select $M_{\text{UV}}\lesssim-20$ galaxies at $z&gt;15$. Observations in the F150W and F200W filters at depths comparable to those in the NIRCam LW bands are also required to mitigate contamination from rare red objects at z$\lesssim$8.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a JWST and ALMA detailed study of the ISM properties of high-redshift galaxies. Our JWST/NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy targeting three galaxies at $z=6-7$ detects key rest-frame optical emission lines, allowing us to derive [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729-based electron densities of $n_\mathrm{e,optical}\sim1000$ cm$^{-3}$ on average and [OIII]$\lambda$4363-based metallicities of $\mathrm{12+log(O/H)}=8.0-8.2$ in two galaxies. New ALMA Band 9/10 observations detect the [OIII]52$\mu$m line in one galaxy but do not in the others, resulting in FIR-based densities of $n_\mathrm{e,FIR}\lesssim500$ cm$^{-3}$ from the [OIII]52$\mu$m/[OIII]88$\mu$m ratios, systematically lower than the optical [OII]-based measurements. These low FIR-based densities are comparable to those at both $z\sim0$ and $z&gt;6$ in the literature, including JADES-GS-z14-0 at $z=14.18$, suggesting little evolution up to $z\sim14$, in contrast to the increasing trend of optical-based densities with redshift. By conducting a JWST and ALMA joint analysis using emission lines detected with both telescopes, we find that the observed FIR [OIII]52,88$\mu$m luminosities are too high to be explained by the optical-based densities at which they would be significantly collisionally de-excited. Instead, a 2-zone model with distinct high- and low-density regions is required to reproduce all observed lines, indicating that FIR [OIII] emission arises predominantly from low-density gas, while optical [OIII] and [OII] lines trace both regions. We further demonstrate that the direct-$T_\mathrm{e}$ method can sometimes significantly underestimate metallicities up to 0.8 dex due to the presence of the low-density gas not fully traced by optical lines alone, highlighting the importance of combining optical and FIR lines to accurately determine gas-phase metallicities in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Fading in the Flow: Suppression of cold gas growth in expanding galactic outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiphase outflows, revealed by multi-wavelength observations, are crucial in redistributing gas and metals within and around galaxies. These outflows are often modelled theoretically using wind tunnel simulations of a cold ($\sim 10^4$ K) cloud interacting with a uniform hot ($\sim 10^6$ K) wind. However, real outflows expand downstream, a feature overlooked in most idealised simulations. We study how an expanding wind affects the survival, morphology, and dynamics of a cloud. We conduct idealised hydrodynamic simulations with optically thin radiative cooling of a cloud in an expanding wind, modelled using the adiabatic Chevalier &amp; Clegg (1985) solution. We find that clouds remain locally isobaric with the wind, leading to a steep decline in their density contrast and eventual dissolution downstream. Compared to a plane-parallel wind, this suppresses cold gas mass growth because as clouds travel downstream, the surrounding mixed boundary layer becomes diffuse and less radiative. Our analytical scaling arguments show that cloud expansion and local pressure equilibrium are the key regulators of cold mass growth. Unlike traditional simulations, our model accounts for the differential expansion experienced by the long cometary tails of clouds in wind tunnels. This creates a strong head-to-tail emission gradient in the filamentary cold gas, which is more consistent with observations. We also demonstrate that the dynamics of individual clouds can substantially alter the radial properties of their host multiphase outflows.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth, event rate, and limits on compact objects in dark matter based on 20 yr of OGLE observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Unusually High Gas-to-Dust Ratios Observed in High-Redshift Quiescent Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracking the cold molecular gas contents of galaxies is critical to understand the interplay between star formation and galaxy growth across cosmic time. Observations of the long-wavelength dust continuum, a proxy for the cold gas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and efficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular gas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich systems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent galaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly weak dust emission, falling a factor of &gt;~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical correlation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust deficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we calculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other observations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from the SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in quiescent galaxies. Ultimately, we conclude that the dust continuum is a highly unreliable tracer of the molecular gas in high-redshift quiescent galaxies. As a consequence we may know much less about the cold gas contents of this population than previously thought.</description>

      <title>GATOS. VIII. On the physical origin of the extended MIR emission in AGN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polar mid-infrared (MIR) emission detected within 10-100s pcs in some active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been associated with dusty winds driven away by radiation pressure. The physical characterization of this extended polar emission remains uncertain. Here we combine 10-21 $\mu$m JWST/MIRI imaging observations with 7-25 $\mu$m JWST/MRS integral field spectroscopic observations of 6 nearby, $\bar{D}=35.4\pm4.6$ Mpc, AGN from the GATOS Survey to quantify the nature of the extended MIR emission at ~75 pc resolution at 21 $\mu$m. These AGN have similar bolometric luminosities, $\log_{10}(\bar{L}_{bol}\,[erg\,s^{-1}])=44.0\pm0.3$, span a wide range of optical outflow rates, $\dot{M}=0.003-0.21$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, column densities, $\log_{10}(N_{H}^{X-ray}[cm^{-2}])=22.2-24.3$, and Eddington ratios, $\lambda_{Edd}=0.005-0.06$. We cross-correlate the line-only and continuum-only images and find a poor correlation, which indicates that the extended MIR continuum emission is spatially uncorrelated with the warm outflows associated with narrow emission lines within 10-15 $\mu$m. Line emission is resolved along the jet axis, while dust emission is perpendicular to it. The 75-450 pc continuum emission has a fairly constant dust temperature, $T_{d}=132^{+7}_{-7}$ K, and mass, $M_{d}=728^{+29}_{-27}$ M$_{\odot}$. Using the conditions of energy balance between radiation-pressure and gravity ($\lambda_{Edd}$ vs. N$_{H}$), we find that our AGN sample is in the gravitationally bounded regime consistent with no detection of dusty winds. At 10 $\mu$m, the level of extended line emission contribution is correlated with the outflow kinetic energy and mass outflow rates. We find no correlation with the AGN properties. These results indicate that the radio jet may be triggering the gas outflow and line emission, while the extended dust emission is distributed in molecular clouds and/or shocked regions.</description>

      <title>RIGEL: Feedback-regulated cloud-scale star formation efficiency in a simulated dwarf galaxy merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Major mergers of galaxies are likely to trigger bursty star formation activities. The accumulation of dense gas and the boost of star formation efficiency (SFE) are considered to be the two main drivers of starbursts. However, it remains unclear how each process operates on the scale of individual star-forming clouds. Here, we present a high-resolution (2 Msun) RHD simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger using the RIGEL model to investigate how mergers affect the properties of the structure of dense star-forming gas and the cloud-scale SFE. We tracked the evolution of sub-virial dense clouds in the simulation by mapping them across successive snapshots taken at intervals of 0.2 Myr. We find that the merger triggers a 130 fold increase in the SFR and shortens the galaxy-wide gas-depletion time by two orders of magnitude compared to those in two isolated galaxies. However, the depletion time of individual clouds and their lifetime distribution remained unchanged over the simulation period. The cloud life cycles and cloud-scale SFE are determined by the local stellar feedback rather than such environmental factors as tidal fields regardless of the merger process, and the integrated SFE ($\epsilon_{\rm int}$) of clouds in complex environments remains well-described by an $\epsilon_{\rm int}-\Sigma_{\rm tot}$ relation found in idealized isolated-cloud experiments. During the peak of the starburst, the media SFE was lower by only 0.17-0.33 dex compared to the value when the galaxies were not interacting. The merger boosts the SFR through the accumulation and compression of dense gas fueling star formation. Strong tidal torques assemble $&gt;10^5$ Msun clouds, which seed massive star clusters. The average separation between star-forming clouds decreases during the merger, which in turn decreases the cloud--cluster spatial de-correlation from &gt;1 kpc to 0.1 kpc depicted in tuning fork diagrams.</description>

Abstract: All existing treatments of bimetric MOND (BIMOND) -- a class of relativistic versions of MOND -- have dealt with a rather restricted sub-class: The Lagrangian of the interaction between the gravitational degrees of freedom -- the two metrics -- is a function of a certain {\it single} scalar argument built from the difference in connections of the two metrics. I show that the scope of BIMOND is much richer: The two metrics can couple through several scalars to give theories that all have a "good" nonrelativistic (NR) limit -- one that accounts correctly, a-la MOND, for the dynamics of galactic systems, {\it including gravitational lensing}. This extended-BIMOND framework exhibits a qualitative departure from the way we think of MOND at present, as encapsulated, in all its aspects, by one "interpolating function" of one acceleration variable. After deriving the general field equations, I pinpoint the subclass of theories that satisfy the pivotal requirement of a good NR limit. These involve three independent, quadratic scalar variables. In the NR limit these scalars all reduce to the same acceleration scalar, and the NR theory then does hinge on one function of a {\it a single} acceleration variable -- representing the NR MOND "interpolating function", whose form is largely dictated by the observed NR galactic dynamics. However, these scalars behave differently, in different relativistic contexts. So, the full richness of the multi-variable Lagrangian, as it enters cosmology, for example, is hardly informed by what we learn from observations of galactic dynamics. In this paper, I present the formalism, with some generic examples. I also consider some cosmological solutions where the two metrics are small departures from one Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric. This may offer a framework for describing cosmology within the extended BIMOND.</description>

      <title>New Spacetime Solutions for Spiral Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a set of spacetime solutions whose rotation curves approach a flat profile at large radii, as observed for spiral galaxies. The associated stress-energy tensor reflects a positive mass and anisotropic pressure. The spatially averaged equation of state, which parametrizes these infinity of solutions, exhibits a lower bound: $w&gt; -\frac{1}{3}$. As examples, we present the spacetime metrics for non-ideal `dust' and `radiation'. The Einstein clusters emerge as another special class, whose EOS parameter is predicted to be given by the limiting rotational velocity as: $w=\frac{v^2}{3c^2}$. Analyzing the gravitational deflection of a light ray penetrating a large halo, we find the correction to the Einsteinian bending angle to be $\Big(\frac{2+3w}{1+3w}\Big)\pi \frac{v^2}{c^2}$.</description>

      <title>Revealing the ages of metal-rich RR Lyrae via kinematic label transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06720</link>

Abstract: RR Lyrae stars have long been considered reliable tracers of old, metal-poor populations, primarily due to their prevalence in globular clusters and the Galactic halo. However, the discovery of a metal-rich subpopulation in the Galactic disc, kinematically colder and more rotationally supported, challenges this classical view. Understanding the age of these metal-rich RR Lyrae stars is crucial for constraining their formation pathways and assessing what Galactic populations they are tracing. In this work, we leverage the unprecedented astrometric precision of Gaia DR3 to infer the age distribution of metal-rich RR Lyrae stars through a kinematic comparison with O-rich Mira variables. Mira variables, with their well-established period-age relation, serve as a natural clock, allowing us to transfer age information to RR Lyrae stars via their phase-space properties. By applying this approach across different metallicity bins, we find that the most metal-rich RR Lyrae stars ($[\rm Fe/H] &gt; -0.5$) exhibit kinematics consistent with long-period ($\rm{period}\approx 150\,\rm{days}$), young Mira variable population; its age corresponds to $\sim 6-7$ Gyr (adopting the period-age relation in Zhang &amp; Sanders 2023) that is significantly younger than typically assumed for RR Lyrae stars. In contrast, those with $-1 &lt; [\rm Fe/H] &lt; -0.5$ show properties more aligned with older ($\approx 9-11$ Gyr) populations. Interestingly we also find evidence of a possible double age populations for the most metal-rich RR Lyrae, one younger with ages between 4 and 6 Gyr, and another one older ranging from 8 to 9 Gyr. These results provide strong evidence that metal-rich RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic field do not exclusively trace ancient populations. This finding challenges the current model of RR Lyrae formation and supports alternative formation scenarios, such as binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee: Final Report and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10574</link>

Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.</description>
