      <title>Transfer Learning and Double U-Net Empowered Wave Propagation Model in Complex Indoor Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Machine Learning (ML) network based on transfer learning and transformer networks is applied to wave propagation models for complex indoor settings. This network is designed to predict signal propagation in environments with a variety of objects, effectively simulating the diverse range of furniture typically found in indoor spaces. We propose Attention U-Net with Efficient Networks as the backbone, to process images encoded with the essential information of the indoor environment. The indoor environment is defined by its fundamental structure, such as the arrangement of walls, windows, and doorways, alongside varying configurations of furniture placement. An innovative algorithm is introduced to generate a 3D environment from a 2D floorplan, which is crucial for efficient collection of data for training. The model is evaluated by comparing the predicted signal coverage map with ray tracing (RT) simulations. The prediction results show a root mean square error of less than 6 dB across all tested scenarios, with significant improvements observed when using a Double U-Net structure compared to a single U-Net model.</description>

      <title>Universal Modem Generation with Inherent Adaptability to Variant Underwater Acoustic Channels: a Data-Driven Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In underwater acoustic (UWA) communication, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is commonly employed to mitigate the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by delay spread. However, path-specific Doppler effects in UWA channels could result in significant inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the OFDM system. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-resolution convolutional neural network (CNN) named UWAModNet in this paper, designed to optimize the modem structure, specifically modulation and demodulation matrices. Based on a trade-off between the minimum and the average equivalent sub-channel rate, we propose an optimization criterion suitable to evaluate the performance of our learned modem. Additionally, a two-stage training strategy is developed to achieve quasi-optimal results. Simulations indicate that the learned modem outperforms zero-padded OFDM (ZP-OFDM) in terms of equivalent sub-channel rate and bit error rate, even under more severe Doppler effects during testing compared to training.</description>

      <title>Signal Detection in Near-field Communication with Unknown Noise Characteristics: A Diffusion Model Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a diffusion model method for signal detection in near-field communication with unknown noise characteristics. We consider an uplink transmission of a near-filed MIMO communication system consisting of multiple mobile terminals and one base station with multiple antennas. Then, we proposed a Maximum Likelihood Estimation Diffusion Detector (MLEDD) aiming at learning the distribution of unknown noise. To this end, we define an error function via Bayes' theorem to detect the source signal. Moreover, we present an implementation of the proposed framework. The performance of the proposed method in terms of bit error rate shows that it outperforms the MLE detector, Detection Network (DetNet), and Maximum Normalizing Flow Estimate method (MANFE) across different signal-to-noise ratios and noise distributions. Especially when the noise distribution is intractable, diffusion, as a state-of-the-art probability model, has the best distribution learning ability compared to other models. These results affirm that this framework can effectively detect signals in near-field scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Modified MUSIC Algorithm for RIS-Assisted Near-Field Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a single-anchor localization system assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), where the objective is to localize multiple user equipments (UEs) placed in the radiative near-field region of the RIS by estimating their azimuth angle-of-arrival (AoA), elevation AoA, and distance to the surface. The three-dimensional (3D) locations can be accurately estimated via the conventional MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, albeit at the expense of tremendous complexity due to the 3D grid search. In this paper, capitalizing on the symmetric structure of the RIS, we propose a novel modified MUSIC algorithm that can efficiently decouple the AoA and distance estimation problems and drastically reduce the complexity compared to the standard 3D MUSIC algorithm. Additionally, we introduce a spatial smoothing method by partitioning the RIS into overlapping sub-RISs to address the rank-deficiency issue in the signal covariance matrix. We corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations and show that it can achieve the same performance as 3D MUSIC but with much lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Decision-change Informed Rejection Improves Robustness in Pattern Recognition-based Myoelectric Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-processing techniques have been shown to improve the quality of the decision stream generated by classifiers used in pattern-recognition-based myoelectric control. However, these techniques have largely been tested individually and on well-behaved, stationary data, failing to fully evaluate their trade-offs between smoothing and latency during dynamic use. Correspondingly, in this work, we survey and compare 8 different post-processing and decision stream improvement schemes in the context of continuous and dynamic class transitions: majority vote, Bayesian fusion, onset locking, outlier detection, confidence-based rejection, confidence scaling, prior adjustment, and adaptive windowing. We then propose two new temporally aware post-processing schemes that use changes in the decision and confidence streams to better reject uncertain decisions. Our decision-change informed rejection (DCIR) approach outperforms existing schemes during both steady-state and transitions based on error rates and decision stream volatility whether using conventional or deep classifiers. These results suggest that added robustness can be gained by appropriately leveraging temporal context in myoelectric control.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Class Transitions on the Design of Pattern Recognition-based Myoelectric Control Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite continued efforts to improve classification accuracy, it has been reported that offline accuracy is a poor indicator of the usability of pattern recognition-based myoelectric control. One potential source of this disparity is the existence of transitions between contraction classes that happen during regular use and are reported to be problematic for pattern recognition systems. Nevertheless, these transitions are often ignored or undefined during both the training and testing processes. In this work, we propose a set of metrics for analyzing the transitions that occur during the voluntary changes between contraction classes during continuous control. These metrics quantify the common types of errors that occur during transitions and compare them to existing metrics that apply only to the steady-state portions of the data. We then use these metrics to analyze transition characteristics of 6 commonly used classifiers on a novel dataset that includes continuous transitions between all combinations of seven different contraction classes. Results show that a linear discriminant classifier consistently outperforms other conventional classifiers during both transitions and steady-state conditions, despite having an almost identical offline performance. Results also show that, although offline training metrics correlate with steady-state performance, they do not correlate with transition performance. These insights suggest that the proposed set of metrics could provide a shift in perspective on the way pattern recognition systems are evaluated and provide a more representative picture of a classifier's performance, potentially narrowing the gap between offline performance and online usability.</description>

      <title>Enhanced DOA Estimation via Hybrid Massive MIMO Receive Array with Switches-based Sparse Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid massive arrays have been widely used in direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for it can provide larger aperture with lower hardware complexity. However, as the signals received by a hybrid array are compressed by the phase shifter network or the switch network, the degree of freedom (DOF) or spatial resolution of hybrid array is lower than fully-digital (FD) array with same number of antennas. Therefore, we develop a novel sparse hybrid array called switches-based sparse hybrid array (SW-SHA) which by combining nested array and switches-based hybrid array to achieve a huge improvement on DOF over traditional hybrid arrays. Simulations of the spatial spectrums verify that SW-SHA can accurately solve the problem of DOA estimation with the number of signal sources much larger than the number of RF chains. Finally, to further improve the accuracy of DOA estimation for SW-SHA, MMV-SW-SHA is proposed by transforming the single-snapshot co-array signal into MMV form. The simulation results also show that MMV-SW-SHA has better performance than SW-SHA when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low.</description>

      <title>Enabling Ultra-Dense, Open-RAN, Vehicular Networks with Non-Linear MIMO Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future autonomous transportation systems necessitate network infrastructure capable of accommodating massive vehicular connectivity, despite the scarce availability of frequency resources. Current approaches for achieving such required high spectral efficiency, rely on the utilization of Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology. However, conventional MIMO processing approaches, based on linear processing principles, leave much of the system's capacity heavily unexploited. They typically require a large number of power-consuming antennas and RF-chains to support a substantially smaller number of concurrently connected devices, even when the devices are transmitting at low rates. This translates to inflated operational costs that become substantial, particularly in ultra-dense, metropolitan-scale deployments. Therefore, the question is how to efficiently harness this unexploited MIMO capacity and fully leverage the available RF infrastructure to maximize device connectivity. Addressing this challenge, this work proposes an Open Radio Access Network (Open-RAN) deployment, with Massively Parallelizable Non-linear (MPNL) MIMO processing for densely deployed, and power-efficient vehicular networks. For the first time, we quantify the substantial gains of MPNL in achieving massive vehicular connectivity with significantly reduced utilized antennas, compared to conventional linear approaches, and without any throughput loss. We find that an Open-RAN-based realization exploiting the MPNL advancements can yield an increase of over 300% in terms of concurrently transmitting single-antenna vehicles in urban mobility settings and for various Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Network (V2N) use cases. In this context, we discuss how implementing MPNL allows for simpler and more densely deployed radio units, paving the way for fully autonomous and sustainable transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Preamble Design for Joint Frame Synchronization, Frequency Offset Estimation, and Channel Estimation in Upstream Burst-mode Detection of Coherent PONs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent optics has demonstrated significant potential as a viable solution for achieving 100 Gb/s and higher speeds in single-wavelength passive optical networks (PON). However, upstream burst-mode coherent detection is a major challenge when adopting coherent optics in access networks. To accelerate digital signal processing (DSP) convergence with a minimal preamble length, we propose a novel burst-mode preamble design based on a constant amplitude zero auto-correlation sequence. This design facilitates comprehensive estimation of linear channel effects in the frequency domain, including polarization state rotation, differential group delay, chromatic dispersion, and polarization-dependent loss, providing overall system response information for channel equalization pre-convergence. Additionally, this preamble utilizes the same training unit to jointly achieve three key DSP functions: frame synchronization, frequency offset estimation, and channel estimation. This integration contributes to a significant reduction in the preamble length. The feasibility of the proposed preamble with a length of 272 symbols and corresponding DSP was experimentally verified in a 15 Gbaud coherent system using dual-polarization 16 quadrature amplitude modulation. The experimental results based on this scheme showed a superior performance of the convergence acceleration.</description>

      <title>Delay Minimization for Movable Antennas-Enabled Anti-Jamming Communications With Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future 6G networks, anti-jamming will become a critical challenge, particularly with the development of intelligent jammers that can initiate malicious interference, posing a significant security threat to communication transmission. Additionally, 6G networks have introduced mobile edge computing (MEC) technology to reduce system delay for edge user equipment (UEs). Thus, one of the key challenges in wireless communications is minimizing the system delay while mitigating interference and improving the communication rate. However, the current fixed-position antenna (FPA) techniques have limited degrees of freedom (DoF) and high power consumption, making them inadequate for communication in highly interfering environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel MEC anti-jamming communication architecture supported by mobile antenna (MA) technology. The core of the MA technique lies in optimizing the position of the antennas to increase DoF. The increase in DoF enhances the system's anti-jamming capabilities and reduces system delay. In this study, our goal is to reduce system delay while ensuring communication security and computational requirements. We design the position of MAs for UEs and the base station (BS), optimize the transmit beamforming at the UEs and the receive beamforming at the BS, and adjust the offloading rates and resource allocation for computation tasks at the MEC server. Since the optimization problem is a non-convex multi-variable coupled problem, we propose an algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition (PDD) combined with successive convex approximation (SCA). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MA architecture and the corresponding schemes offer superior anti-jamming capabilities and reduce the system delay compared to FPA.</description>

Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can ensure the accuracy of sensing targets and improve the communication secrecy rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is one of the key technologies in 6G, and related research and standardization efforts are progressing vigorously. Wireless channel simulation is the cornerstone for the evaluation and optimization of wireless communication technologies. This paper proposes a design and implementation method for an ISAC channel simulation based on a Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM) simulation framework. First, we introduce the progress of 3GPP ISAC channel standardization and the key topics of discussion. Second, addressing the current lack of a standardized ISAC channel simulation framework, we propose a cascaded ISAC channel simulation framework based on GBSM, leveraging our team's related measurements, analyses, and proposal results. Based on this framework, we develop and design the ISAC channel simulator BUPTCMCC-6G-CMG+. Finally, we analyze and validate the simulation platform results, and provide some prospects for future ISAC testing research combined with channel simulators.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQR) is an emerging quantum precision sensing platform designed for receiving radio frequency (RF) signals. It relies on creation of Rydberg atoms from normal atoms by exciting one or more electrons to a very high energy level, which in turn makes the atom sensitive to RF signals. The RAQR realizes RF-to-optical conversion based on light-atom interaction relying on the so called electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Aulter-Townes splitting (ATS), so that the desired RF signal can be read out optically. The large dipole moments of Rydberg atoms associated with rich choices of Rydberg states and various modulation schemes facilitate an ultra-high sensitivity ($\sim$ nV/cm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$) and an ultra-broadband tunability (near direct-current to Terahertz). RAQRs also exhibit compelling scalability and lend themselves to the construction of innovative, compact receivers. Initial experimental studies have demonstrated their capabilities in classical wireless communications and sensing. To fully harness their potential in a wide variety of applications, we commence by outlining the underlying fundamentals of Rydberg atoms, followed by the principles, structures, and theories of RAQRs. Finally, we conceive Rydberg atomic quantum single-input single-output (RAQ-SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) schemes for facilitating the integration of RAQRs with classical wireless systems, and conclude with a set of potent research directions.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Data Collection for IoT Networks via Rainbow Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted Internet of things (IoT) systems have become an important part of future wireless communications. To achieve higher communication rate, the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation is crucial. This letter considers a scenario where a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched to simultaneously collect data from multiple ground IoT nodes (GNs) within a time interval. To improve the sum data collection (SDC) volume, i.e., the total data volume transmitted by the GNs, the UAV trajectory, the UAV receive beamforming, the scheduling of the GNs, and the transmit power of the GNs are jointly optimized. Since the problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are highly coupled, it is hard to solve using traditional optimization methods. To find a near-optimal solution, a double-loop structured optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm and a fully DRL-based algorithm are proposed to solve the problem effectively. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms outperform two benchmarks with significant improvement in SDC volumes.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Enhanced Multilayered Non-Convex Regularization with Epigraphical Relaxation for Debiased Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a precise signal recovery method with multilayered non-convex regularization, enhancing sparsity/low-rankness for high-dimensional signals including images and videos. In optimization-based signal recovery, multilayered convex regularization functions based on the L1 and nuclear-norms not only guarantee a global optimal solution but also offer more accurate estimation than single-layered ones, thanks to their faithful modeling of structured sparsity and low-rankness in high-dimensional signals. However, these functions are known to yield biased solutions (estimated with smaller amplitude values than the true ones). To address this issue, multilayered non-convex regularization functions have been considered, although they face their own challenges: 1) their closed-form proximity operators are unavailable, and 2) convergence may result in a local optimal solution. In this paper, we resolve the two issues with an approach based on epigraphical relaxation (ER). First, ER decomposes a multilayered non-convex regularization function into the outermost function and epigraph constraints for the inner functions, facilitating the computation of proximity operators. Second, the relaxed regularization functions by ER are integrated into a non-convexly regularized convex optimization model to estimate a global optimal solution with less bias. Numerical experiments demonstrate the bias reduction achieved by the proposed method in image recovery and principal component analysis.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC Systems with Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence integrated next-generation communication networks, mobile users (MUs) are increasingly demanding the efficient processing of computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks. However, existing mobile computing networks struggle to support the rapidly growing computational needs of the MUs. Fortunately, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) supported mobile edge computing (MEC) is regarded as an effective solution, offering the MUs multi-tier and efficient computing services. In this paper, we consider an SAGIN supported MEC system, where a low Earth orbit satellite and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to provide computing services for MUs. An energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, with the joint optimization of the MU-UAV association, the UAV trajectory, the task offloading decision, the computing frequency, and the transmission power control. Since the problem is non-convex, we decompose it into four subproblems, and propose an alternating optimization based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming and Waveform Design for Over-the-air Integrated Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future wireless communications are expected to provide new use scenarios with emerging techniques. This paper focuses on vehicle to everything (V2X) network, where vehicles should cooperatively implement information obtaining, data sharing, and information postprocessing. Conventionally, the above three operations are considered in different layers or separated waveforms, leading to unavoidable interference and inefficient resource management when the number of devices becomes large. In this paper, we exploit the hybrid beamforming to design a cost-effective over-the-air integrated framework, and further consider the integrated waveform design problem with the constant-modulus constrain (CMC) and similarity constraint (SC). To solve these non-convex problems, an alternating optimization (AO) approach is proposed to jointly optimize the digital precoder as well as the hybrid combiner, using the successive convex approximation (SCA) and Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm. Additionally, we use the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method to handle the practical waveform design problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid beamforming and waveform design.</description>

      <title>A Cupola-Shaped Multimode Multiport Antenna for Aerial Direction Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multimode multiport antenna (M$^3$PA), constisting of a single conducting structure, is proposed for use with the airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS). Its cupola-shaped surface is selected from a set of aerodynamically suitable and symmetric structures. The selection is based on a presented statistical evaluation procedure for direction-finding (DF) antennas and algorithms, which predicts the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimation using characteristic modes (CMs). A demonstrator antenna and feed network is manufactured and its three ports are measured in an anechoic chamber. The results match the intended far-fields of an electric monopole and two magnetic dipoles. The presented flight test results show that the antenna is capable of unambiguous DF across the desired angular range in a real world environment.</description>

      <title>Energy Saving in 6G O-RAN Using DQN-based xApp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (RAN) is a transformative paradigm that supports openness, interoperability, and intelligence, with the O-RAN architecture being the most recognized framework in academia and industry. In the context of Open RAN, the importance of Energy Saving (ES) is heightened, especially with the current direction of network densification in sixth generation of mobile networks (6G). Traditional energy-saving methods in RAN struggle with the increasing dynamics of the network. This paper proposes using Reinforcement Learning (RL), a subset of Machine Learning (ML), to improve ES. We present a novel deep RL method for ES in 6G O-RAN, implemented as xApp (ES-xApp). We developed two Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based ES-xApps. ES-xApp-1 uses RSS and User Equipment (UE) geolocations, while ES-xApp-2 uses only RSS. The proposed models significantly outperformed heuristic and baseline xApps, especially with over 20 UEs. With 50 UEs, 50% of Radio Cards (RCs) were switched off, compared to 17% with the heuristic algorithm. We have observed that more informative inputs may lead to more stable training and results. This paper highlights the necessity of energy conservation in wireless networks and offers practical strategies and evidence for future research and industry practices.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware and Routing-Flexible Network Slicing for Service-Oriented Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the network slicing (NS) problem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests (also called services) to a common shared network infrastructure and manage network resources to meet diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation for the considered NS problem that can flexibly route the traffic flow of the services on multiple paths and provide end-to-end delay and reliability guarantees for all services. To overcome the computational difficulty due to the intrinsic nonlinearity in the MINLP formulation, we transform the MINLP formulation into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and further show that their continuous relaxations are equivalent. In sharp contrast to the continuous relaxation of the MINLP formulation which is a nonconvex nonlinear programming problem, the continuous relaxation of the MILP formulation is a polynomial-time solvable linear programming problem, which significantly facilitates the algorithmic design. Based on the newly proposed MILP formulation, we develop a customized column generation (cCG) algorithm for solving the NS problem. The proposed cCG algorithm is a decomposition-based algorithm and is particularly suitable for solving large-scale NS problems. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulations and the proposed cCG algorithm.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided Multiuser Communication: Co-design of Transmit Diversity and Active/Passive Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has become a cost-effective solution for constructing a smart and adaptive radio environment. Most previous works on IRS have jointly designed the active and passive precoding based on perfectly or partially known channel state information (CSI). However, in delay-sensitive or high-mobility communications, it is imperative to explore more effective methods for leveraging IRS to enhance communication reliability without the need for any CSI. In this paper, we investigate an innovative IRS-aided multiuser communication system, which integrates an IRS with its aided multi-antenna base station (BS) to simultaneously serve multiple high-mobility users through transmit diversity and multiple low-mobility users through active/passive precoding. In specific, we first reveal that when dynamically tuning the IRS's common phase-shift shared with all reflecting elements, its passive precoding gain to any low-mobility user remains unchanged. Inspired by this property, we utilize the design of common phase-shift at the IRS for achieving transmit diversity to serve high-mobility users, yet without requiring any CSI at the BS. Meanwhile, the active/passive precoding design is incorporated into the IRS-integrated BS to serve low-mobility users (assuming the CSI is known). Then, taking into account the interference among different users, we formulate and solve a joint optimization problem of the IRS's reflect precoding and the BS's transmit precoding, with the aim of minimizing the total transmit power at the BS.</description>

      <title>ESDS: AI-Powered Early Stunting Detection and Monitoring System using Edited Radius-SMOTE Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stunting detection is a significant issue in Indonesian healthcare, causing lower cognitive function, lower productivity, a weakened immunity, delayed neuro-development, and degenerative diseases. In regions with a high prevalence of stunting and limited welfare resources, identifying children in need of treatment is critical. The diagnostic process often raises challenges, such as the lack of experience in medical workers, incompatible anthropometric equipment, and inefficient medical bureaucracy. To counteract the issues, the use of load cell sensor and ultrasonic sensor can provide suitable anthropometric equipment and streamline the medical bureaucracy for stunting detection. This paper also employs machine learning for stunting detection based on sensor readings. The experiment results show that the sensitivity of the load cell sensor and the ultrasonic sensor is 0.9919 and 0.9986, respectively. Also, the machine learning test results have three classification classes, which are normal, stunted, and stunting with an accuracy rate of 98\%.</description>

      <title>Sparse Low-Ranked Self-Attention Transformer for Remaining Useful Lifetime Prediction of Optical Fiber Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical fiber amplifiers are key elements in present optical networks. Failures of these components result in high financial loss of income of the network operator as the communication traffic over an affected link is interrupted. Applying Remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction in the context of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) to optical fiber amplifiers to predict upcoming system failures at an early stage, so that network outages can be minimized through planning of targeted maintenance actions, ensures reliability and safety. Optical fiber amplifier are complex systems, that work under various operating conditions, which makes correct forecasting a difficult task. Increased monitoring capabilities of systems results in datasets that facilitate the application of data-driven RUL prediction methods. Deep learning models in particular have shown good performance, but generalization based on comparatively small datasets for RUL prediction is difficult. In this paper, we propose Sparse Low-ranked self-Attention Transformer (SLAT) as a novel RUL prediction method. SLAT is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, wherein two parallel working encoders extract features for sensors and time steps. By utilizing the self-attention mechanism, long-term dependencies can be learned from long sequences. The implementation of sparsity in the attention matrix and a low-rank parametrization reduce overfitting and increase generalization. Experimental application to optical fiber amplifiers exemplified on EDFA, as well as a reference dataset from turbofan engines, shows that SLAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Low-Complexity Digital Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel low-complexity digital backpropagation (DBP) method, with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between backpropagation accuracy and complexity. The method combines a split step Fourier method (SSFM)-like structure with a simplifed logarithmic perturbation method to obtain a high accuracy with a small number of DBP steps. Subband processing and asymmetric steps with optimized splitting ratio are also employed to further reduce the number of steps. The first part of the manuscript is dedicated to the derivation of a simplified logaritmic-perturbation model for the propagation of a dual-polarization multiband signal in a fiber, which serves as a theoretical background for the development of the proposed coupled-band enhanced SSFM (CBESSFM). Next, the manuscript presents a digital signal processing algorithm for the implementation of DBP based on a discrete-time version of the model and an overlap-and-save processing strategy. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm is also presented. Finally, the performance and complexity of the proposed DBP method are investigated through numerical simulations. In a wavelength division multiplexing system over a 15 x 80km single mode fiber link, the proposed CB-ESSFM achieves a gain of about 1 dB over simple dispersion compensation with only 15 steps (corresponding to about 680 real multiplications per 2D symbol), with an improvement of 0.9 dB w.r.t. conventional SSFM and almost 0.4 dB w.r.t. our previously proposed ESSFM. Significant gains are obtained also at lower complexity. For instance, the gain reduces to a still significant value of 0.34 dB when a single DBP step is employed, requiring just 75 real multiplications per 2D symbol. A similar analysis is performed also for longer links, confirming the good performance of the proposed method w.r.t. the others.</description>

Abstract: We derive a minimax distributionally robust inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm to reconstruct the utility functions of a multi-agent sensing system. Specifically, we construct utility estimators which minimize the worst-case prediction error over a Wasserstein ambiguity set centered at noisy signal observations. We prove the equivalence between this robust estimation and a semi-infinite optimization reformulation, and we propose a consistent algorithm to compute solutions. We illustrate the efficacy of this robust IRL scheme in numerical studies to reconstruct the utility functions of a cognitive radar network from observed tracking signals.</description>

      <title>Near-field Beam Focusing under Discrete Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising technology for enabling near-field communications in future wireless systems. However, the huge number of antennas pose demanding challenges on the hardware cost and energy consumption, especially when the antennas employ high-resolution phase shifters (PSs). To address this issue, in this paper, we consider discrete PSs at the XL-array which are practically more energy efficient, and investigate the impact of PS resolution on the near-field beam-focusing effect. To this end, we propose a new Fourier series expansion method to efficiently tackle the difficulty in characterising the beam pattern properties under phase quantization. Interestingly, we analytically show, for the first time, that 1) discrete PSs introduce additional grating lobes; 2) the main lobe still exhibits the beam-focusing effect with its beam power increasing with PS resolution; and 3) there are two types of grating lobes, featured by the beam-focusing and beam-steering effects, respectively. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the grating lobes generally degrade the communication performance. However, a low-resolution of 3-bit PSs can achieve similar beam pattern and rate performance with the continuous PS counterpart, while it attains much higher energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting for Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Performance Analysis and Generative AI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) provides a ubiquitous coverage to user equipments (UEs) but it is also susceptible to interference. Ratesplitting (RS) effectively extracts data by decoding interference, yet its effectiveness is limited by the weakest UE. In this paper, we investigate an RS-based CF massive MIMO system, which combines strengths and mitigates weaknesses of both approaches. Considering imperfect channel state information (CSI) resulting from both pilot contamination and noise, we derive a closed-form expression for the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system under a spatially correlated Rician channel. Moreover, we propose low-complexity heuristic algorithms based on statistical CSI for power-splitting of common messages and power-control of private messages, and genetic algorithm is adopted as a solution for upper bound performance. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem, aiming to maximize the sum SE of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system by optimizing the power-splitting factor and power-control coefficient. Importantly, we improve a generative AI (GAI) algorithm to address this complex and nonconvexity problem by using a diffusion model to obtain solutions. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in mitigating interference, especially in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication Enabled 6G-NTN Framework: A Novel Denoising and Gateway Hop Integration Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are crucial for real-time monitoring in critical applications like disaster relief. However, limited bandwidth, latency, rain attenuation, long propagation delays, and co-channel interference pose challenges to efficient satellite communication. Therefore, semantic communication (SC) has emerged as a promising solution to improve transmission efficiency and address these issues. In this paper, we explore the potential of SC as a bandwidth-efficient, latency-minimizing strategy specifically suited to 6G satellite communications. While existing SC methods have demonstrated efficacy in direct satellite-terrestrial transmissions, they encounter limitations in satellite networks due to distortion accumulation across gateway hop-relays. Additionally, certain ground users (GUs) experience poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), making direct satellite communication challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that optimizes gateway hop-relay selection for GUs with low SNR and integrates gateway-based denoising mechanisms to ensure high-quality-of-service (QoS) in satellite-based SC networks. This approach directly mitigates distortion, leading to significant improvements in satellite service performance by delivering customized services tailored to the unique signal conditions of each GU. Our findings represent a critical advancement in reliable and efficient data transmission from the Earth observation satellites, thereby enabling fast and effective responses to urgent events.

      <title>Energy-Aware Federated Learning in Satellite Constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning in satellite constellations, where the satellites collaboratively train a machine learning model, is a promising technology towards enabling globally connected intelligence and the integration of space networks into terrestrial mobile networks. The energy required for this computationally intensive task is provided either by solar panels or by an internal battery if the satellite is in Earth's shadow. Careful management of this battery and system's available energy resources is not only necessary for reliable satellite operation, but also to avoid premature battery aging. We propose a novel energy-aware computation time scheduler for satellite FL, which aims to minimize battery usage without any impact on the convergence speed. Numerical results indicate an increase of more than 3x in battery lifetime can be achieved over energy-agnostic task scheduling.</description>

      <title>Novel Gradient Sparsification Algorithm via Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error accumulation is an essential component of the Top-$k$ sparsification method in distributed gradient descent. It implicitly scales the learning rate and prevents the slow-down of lateral movement, but it can also deteriorate convergence. This paper proposes a novel sparsification algorithm called regularized Top-$k$ (RegTop-$k$) that controls the learning rate scaling of error accumulation. The algorithm is developed by looking at the gradient sparsification as an inference problem and determining a Bayesian optimal sparsification mask via maximum-a-posteriori estimation. It utilizes past aggregated gradients to evaluate posterior statistics, based on which it prioritizes the local gradient entries. Numerical experiments with ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 show that at $0.1\%$ sparsification, RegTop-$k$ achieves about $8\%$ higher accuracy than standard Top-$k$.</description>

      <title>Risk Estimate under a Nonstationary Autoregressive Model for Data-Driven Reproduction Number Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore epidemiological models which, though describing a rich variety of behaviors, have previously received little attention in the signal processing literature. During the pandemic, several works successfully leveraged state-of-the-art signal processing strategies to robustly infer epidemiological indicators despite the low quality of COVID-19 data. In the present work, a novel nonstationary autoregressive model is introduced, encompassing, but not reducing to, one of the most popular models for the propagation of viral epidemics. Using a variational framework, penalized likelihood estimators of the parameters of this new model are designed. In practice, the main bottleneck is that the estimation accuracy strongly depends on hyperparameters tuning. Without available ground truth, hyperparameters are selected by minimizing specifically designed data-driven oracles, used as proxy for the estimation error. Focusing on the nonstationary autoregressive Poisson model, the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate formalism is generalized to construct asymptotically unbiased risk estimators based on the derivation of an original autoregressive counterpart of Stein's lemma. The accuracy of these oracles and of the resulting estimates are assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data. Then, elaborating on recent epidemiological models, a novel weekly scaled Poisson model is proposed, enabling to better account for intrinsic variability of the contamination while being robust to reporting errors. Finally, the overall data-driven procedure is particularized to the estimation of COVID-19 reproduction number and exemplified on real COVID-19 infection counts in different countries and at different stages of the pandemic, demonstrating its ability to yield consistent estimates.</description>

      <title>End-User-Centric Collaborative MIMO: Performance Analysis and Proof of Concept</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trend toward using increasingly large arrays of antenna elements continues. However, fitting more antennas into the limited space available on user equipment (UE) within the currently popular Frequency Range 1 spectrum presents a significant challenge. This limitation constrains the capacity scaling gains for end users, even when networks can support a higher number of antennas. To address this issue, we explore a user-centric collaborative MIMO approach, termed UE-CoMIMO, which leverages several fixed or portable devices within a personal area to form a virtually expanded antenna array. This paper develops a comprehensive mathematical framework to analyze the performance of UE-CoMIMO. Our analytical results demonstrate that UE-CoMIMO can significantly enhance the system's effective channel response within the current communication system without requiring extensive modifications. Further performance improvements can be realized by optimizing the phase shifters on the expanded antenna arrays at the collaborative devices. These findings are corroborated by ray-tracing simulations. Beyond the simulations, we implemented these collaborative devices and successfully conducted over-the-air validation in a real 5G environment, showcasing the practical potential of UE-CoMIMO. Several practical perspectives are discussed, highlighting the feasibility and benefits of this approach in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reliable and Secure Communications Through Compact Ultra-Massive Antenna Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact Ultramassive Antenna Array (CUMA) is a pioneering paradigm that leverages the flexibility of the Fluid Antenna System (FAS) to enable a simple multiple access scheme for massive connectivity without the need for precoding, power control at the base station or interference mitigation in each user's equipment. In order to overcome the mathematical intricacy required to analyze their performance, we use an asymptotic matching approach to relax such complexity with a remarkable accuracy. First, we analyze the performance of the CUMA network in terms of the outage probability (OP) and the ergodic rate (ER), deriving simple and highly accurate closed-form approximations to the channel statistics. Then, we evaluate the potential of the CUMA scheme to provide secure multi-user communications from a physical layer security perspective. Leveraging a tight approximation to the signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) distribution, we derive closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP). We observe that the baseline CUMA (without side information processing) exhibits limited performance when eavesdroppers are equipped with a CUMA of the same type. To improve their secure performance, we suggest that a simple imperfect interference cancellation mechanism at the legitimate receiver may substantially increase the secrecy performance. Monte Carlo simulations validate our approximations and demonstrate their accuracy under different CUMA-based scenarios.</description>

      <title>Chattronics: using GPTs to assist in the design of data acquisition systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The usefulness of Large Language Models (LLM) is being continuously tested in various fields. However, their intrinsic linguistic characteristic is still one of the limiting factors when applying these models to exact sciences. In this article, a novel approach to use General Pre-Trained Transformers to assist in the design phase of data acquisition systems will be presented. The solution is packaged in the form of an application that retains the conversational aspects of LLMs, in such a manner that the user must provide details on the desired project in order for the model to draft both a system-level architectural diagram and the block-level specifications, following a Top-Down methodology based on restrictions. To test this tool, two distinct user emulations were used, one of which uses an additional GPT model. In total, 4 different data acquisition projects were used in the testing phase, each with its own measurement requirements: angular position, temperature, acceleration and a fourth project with both pressure and superficial temperature measurements. After 160 test iterations, the study concludes that there is potential for these models to serve adequately as synthesis/assistant tools for data acquisition systems, but there are still technological limitations. The results show coherent architectures and topologies, but that GPTs have difficulties in simultaneously considering all requirements and many times commits theoretical mistakes.</description>

      <title>Joint Discrete Precoding and RIS Optimization for RIS-Assisted MU-MIMO Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system where the downlink communication between a base station (BS) and multiple user equipments (UEs) is aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). We study the sum rate maximization problem with the objective of finding the optimal precoding vectors and RIS configuration. Due to fronthaul limitation, each entry of the precoding vectors must be picked from a finite set of quantization labels. Furthermore, two scenarios for the RIS are investigated, one with continuous infinite-resolution reflection coefficients and another with discrete finite-resolution reflection coefficients. A novel framework is developed which, in contrast to the common literature that only offers sub-optimal solutions for optimization of discrete variables, is able to find the optimal solution to problems involving discrete constraints. Based on the classical weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), we transform the original problem into an equivalent weighted sum mean square error (MSE) minimization problem and solve it iteratively. We compute the optimal precoding vectors via an efficient algorithm inspired by sphere decoding (SD). For optimizing the discrete RIS configuration, two solutions based on the SD algorithm are developed: An optimal SD-based algorithm and a low-complexity heuristic method that can efficiently obtain RIS configuration without much loss in optimality. The effectiveness of the presented algorithms is corroborated via numerical simulations where it is shown that the proposed designs are remarkably superior to the commonly used benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Radio Channel Representation for 5G and 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A site-specific radio channel representation (SSCR) takes the surroundings of the communication system into account by considering the environment geometry, including buildings, vegetation, and mobile objects with their material and surface properties. We present methods for an SSCR that is spatially consistent, such that mobile transmitter and receiver cause a correlated time-varying channel impulse response and closely spaced antennas are correctly correlated. An SSCR is composed of a dynamically varying number of multipath components (MPCs) solely defined by the environment geometry and the material of the environmental objects. Hence, the environment geometry is the only natural scenario parameterization and specific calibration procedures shall be avoided. 5G and 6G physical layer technologies are increasingly able to exploit the properties of a wide range of environments from dense urban areas to railways, road transportation, industrial automation, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The channel impulse response in this wide range of scenarios has generally non-stationary statistical properties, i.e., the Doppler spectrum, power delay profile, K-factor and spatial correlation are all spatially variant (or time-variant for mobile receivers). SSCRs will enable research and development of emerging 5G and 6G technologies such as distributed multiple-input multiple-output systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, multi-band communication, and joint communication and sensing. We highlight the state of the art and summarize research directions for future work towards an SSCR.</description>

      <title>SPEED: Scalable Preprocessing of EEG Data for Self-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) research typically focuses on tasks with narrowly defined objectives, but recent studies are expanding into the use of unlabeled data within larger models, aiming for a broader range of applications. This addresses a critical challenge in EEG research. For example, Kostas et al. (2021) show that self-supervised learning (SSL) outperforms traditional supervised methods. Given the high noise levels in EEG data, we argue that further improvements are possible with additional preprocessing. Current preprocessing methods often fail to efficiently manage the large data volumes required for SSL, due to their lack of optimization, reliance on subjective manual corrections, and validation processes or inflexible protocols that limit SSL. We propose a Python-based EEG preprocessing pipeline optimized for self-supervised learning, designed to efficiently process large-scale data. This optimization not only stabilizes self-supervised training but also enhances performance on downstream tasks compared to training with raw data.</description>

      <title>Transfer-based Adversarial Poisoning Attacks for Online (MIMO-)Deep Receviers</title>

Abstract: Recently, the design of wireless receivers using deep neural networks (DNNs), known as deep receivers, has attracted extensive attention for ensuring reliable communication in complex channel environments. To adapt quickly to dynamic channels, online learning has been adopted to update the weights of deep receivers with over-the-air data (e.g., pilots). However, the fragility of neural models and the openness of wireless channels expose these systems to malicious attacks. To this end, understanding these attack methods is essential for robust receiver design. In this paper, we propose a transfer-based adversarial poisoning attack method for online receivers. Without knowledge of the attack target, adversarial perturbations are injected to the pilots, poisoning the online deep receiver and impairing its ability to adapt to dynamic channels and nonlinear effects. In particular, our attack method targets Deep Soft Interference Cancellation (DeepSIC)[1] using online meta-learning. As a classical model-driven deep receiver, DeepSIC incorporates wireless domain knowledge into its architecture. This integration allows it to adapt efficiently to time-varying channels with only a small number of pilots, achieving optimal performance in a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) scenario. The deep receiver in this scenario has a number of applications in the field of wireless communication, which motivates our study of the attack methods targeting it. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack in simulations on synthetic linear, synthetic nonlinear, static, and COST 2100 channels. Simulation results indicate that the proposed poisoning attack significantly reduces the performance of online receivers in rapidly changing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Train-On-Request: An On-Device Continual Learning Workflow for Adaptive Real-World Brain Machine Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are expanding beyond clinical settings thanks to advances in hardware and algorithms. However, they still face challenges in user-friendliness and signal variability. Classification models need periodic adaptation for real-life use, making an optimal re-training strategy essential to maximize user acceptance and maintain high performance. We propose TOR, a train-on-request workflow that enables user-specific model adaptation to novel conditions, addressing signal variability over time. Using continual learning, TOR preserves knowledge across sessions and mitigates inter-session variability. With TOR, users can refine, on demand, the model through on-device learning (ODL) to enhance accuracy adapting to changing conditions. We evaluate the proposed methodology on a motor-movement dataset recorded with a non-stigmatizing wearable BMI headband, achieving up to 92% accuracy and a re-calibration time as low as 1.6 minutes, a 46% reduction compared to a naive transfer learning workflow. We additionally demonstrate that TOR is suitable for ODL in extreme edge settings by deploying the training procedure on a RISC-V ultra-low-power SoC (GAP9), resulting in 21.6 ms of latency and 1 mJ of energy consumption per training step. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first demonstration of an online, energy-efficient, dynamic adaptation of a BMI model to the intrinsic variability of EEG signals in real-time settings.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning via VICReg Enables Training of EMG Pattern Recognition Using Continuous Data with Unclear Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the application of self-supervised learning via pre-trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for training surface electromyography pattern recognition models (sEMG-PR) using dynamic data with transitions. While labeling such data poses challenges due to the absence of ground-truth labels during transitions between classes, self-supervised pre-training offers a way to circumvent this issue. We compare the performance of LSTMs trained with either fully-supervised or self-supervised loss to a conventional non-temporal model (LDA) on two data types: segmented ramp data (lacking transition information) and continuous dynamic data inclusive of class transitions. Statistical analysis reveals that the temporal models outperform non-temporal models when trained with continuous dynamic data. Additionally, the proposed VICReg pre-trained temporal model with continuous dynamic data significantly outperformed all other models. Interestingly, when using only ramp data, the LSTM performed worse than the LDA, suggesting potential overfitting due to the absence of sufficient dynamics. This highlights the interplay between data type and model choice. Overall, this work highlights the importance of representative dynamics in training data and the potential for leveraging self-supervised approaches to enhance sEMG-PR models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical communication is the standard for high-bandwidth information transfer in today's digital age. The increasing demand for bandwidth has led to the maturation of coherent transceivers that use phase- and amplitude-modulated optical signals to encode more bits of information per transmitted pulse. Such encoding schemes achieve higher information density, but also require more complicated receivers to discriminate the signaling states. In fact, achieving the ultimate limit of optical communication capacity, especially in the low light regime, requires coherent joint detection of multiple pulses. Despite their superiority, such joint detection receivers are not in widespread use because of the difficulty of constructing them in the optical domain. In this work we describe how optomechanical transduction of phase information from coherent optical pulses to superconducting qubit states followed by the execution of trained short-depth variational quantum circuits can perform joint detection of communication codewords with error probabilities that surpass all classical, individual pulse detection receivers. Importantly, we utilize a model of optomechanical transduction that captures non-idealities such as thermal noise and loss in order to understand the transduction performance necessary to achieve a quantum advantage with such a scheme. We also execute the trained variational circuits on an IBM-Q device with the modeled transduced states as input to demonstrate that a quantum advantage is possible even with current levels of quantum computing hardware noise.</description>

Abstract: The novel concept of near-field velocity sensing is proposed. In contrast to far-field velocity sensing, near-field velocity sensing enables the simultaneous estimation of both radial and transverse velocities of a moving target. A maximum-likelihood-based method is proposed for jointly estimating the radial and transverse velocities from the echo signals. Assisted by near-field velocity sensing, a predictive beamforming framework is proposed for a moving communication user, which requires no channel estimation but achieves seamless data transmission. Finally, numerical examples validate the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization With Across-Task Transferable Max-Value Entropy Search</title>

Abstract: In many applications, ranging from logistics to engineering, a designer is faced with a sequence of optimization tasks for which the objectives are in the form of black-box functions that are costly to evaluate. Furthermore, higher-fidelity evaluations of the optimization objectives often entail a larger cost. Existing multi-fidelity black-box optimization strategies select candidate solutions and fidelity levels with the goal of maximizing the information about the optimal value or the optimal solution for the current task. Assuming that successive optimization tasks are related, this paper introduces a novel information-theoretic acquisition function that balances the need to acquire information about the current task with the goal of collecting information transferable to future tasks. The proposed method transfers across tasks distributions over parameters of a Gaussian process surrogate model by implementing particle-based variational Bayesian updates. Theoretical insights based on the analysis of the expected regret substantiate the benefits of acquiring transferable knowledge across tasks. Furthermore, experimental results across synthetic and real-world examples reveal that the proposed acquisition strategy that caters to future tasks can significantly improve the optimization efficiency as soon as a sufficient number of tasks is processed.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Semantic-Bit Coexisting Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11693</link>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to superior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</description>

      <title>GeNet: A Graph Neural Network-based Anti-noise Task-Oriented Semantic Communication Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic communication tasks rely on the knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to mitigate channel noise. Moreover, these methods necessitate training under specific SNR conditions, entailing considerable time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose GeNet, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based paradigm for semantic communication aimed at combating noise, thereby facilitating Task-Oriented Communication (TOC). We propose a novel approach where we first transform the input data image into graph structures. Then we leverage a GNN-based encoder to extract semantic information from the source data. This extracted semantic information is then transmitted through the channel. At the receiver's end, a GNN-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct the relevant semantic information from the source data for TOC. Through experimental evaluation, we show GeNet's effectiveness in anti-noise TOC while decoupling the SNR dependency. We further evaluate GeNet's performance by varying the number of nodes, revealing its versatility as a new paradigm for semantic communication. Additionally, we show GeNet's robustness to geometric transformations by testing it with different rotation angles, without resorting to data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Multimodal Speech Representations for the Assessment of Schizophrenia Symptoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal schizophrenia assessment systems have gained traction over the last few years. This work introduces a schizophrenia assessment system to discern between prominent symptom classes of schizophrenia and predict an overall schizophrenia severity score. We develop a Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE) based Multimodal Representation Learning (MRL) model to produce task-agnostic speech representations from vocal Tract Variables (TVs) and Facial Action Units (FAUs). These representations are then used in a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based downstream prediction model to obtain class labels and an overall severity score. The proposed framework outperforms the previous works on the multi-class classification task across all evaluation metrics (Weighted F1 score, AUC-ROC score, and Weighted Accuracy). Additionally, it estimates the schizophrenia severity score, a task not addressed by earlier approaches.</description>
