      <title>Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a transverse field: a low-dimensional quantum spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact solution of ferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a transverse field, which can be used to describe the critical phenomena in low-dimensional quantum spin systems, is derived by equivalence between the ferromagnetic 2D Ising model with a transverse field and the ferromagnetic three-dimensional (3D) Ising model. The results obtained in this work can be extended to be suitable for the antiferromagnetic 2D Ising model with a transverse field in the cases without frustration.</description>

      <title>Laws of thermodynamics for exponential families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the laws of thermodynamics in terms of general exponential families. By casting learning (log-loss minimization) problems in max-entropy and statistical mechanics terms, we translate thermodynamics results to learning scenarios. We extend the well-known way in which exponential families characterize thermodynamic and learning equilibria. Basic ideas of work and heat, and advanced concepts of thermodynamic cycles and equipartition of energy, find exact and useful counterparts in AI / statistics terms. These ideas have broad implications for quantifying and addressing distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bias of collective oscillation frequency induced by asymmetric Cauchy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the effect of nonlinear bias of the frequency of collective oscillations of sin-coupled phase oscillators subject to individual asymmetric Cauchy noises. The noise asymmetry makes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz inapplicable. We argue that, for all stable non-Gaussian noises, the tail asymmetry is not only possible (in addition to the trivial shift of the distribution median) but also generic in many physical and biophysical set-ups. For the theoretical description of the effect, we develop a mathematical formalism based on the circular cumulants. The derivation of rigorous asymptotic results can be performed on this basis but seems infeasible in traditional terms of the circular moments (the Kuramoto-Daido order parameters). The effect of the entrainment of individual oscillator frequencies by the global oscillations is also reported in detail. The accuracy of theoretical results based on the low dimensional circular cumulant reductions is validated with the high-accuracy "exact" solutions calculated with the continued fraction method.</description>

      <title>Geometric Brownian Information Engine: Time evolution of extractable work, power, and efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of finite cycle period time ($\tau$) on the extractable work, power, and efficiency of the Geometric Brownian Information Engine (GBIE). The GBIE consists of overdamped Brownian particles confined within a monolobal geometry. It incorporates an error-free feedback controller that converts the information obtained about the state of the trapped Brownian particles into extractable work. The engine transitions from a high non-equilibrium steady state to a completely relaxed state. The performance of the information engine depends on the cycle period $(\tau)$, measurement distance $(x_m)$, and feedback location $(x_f)$ of the confinement.
  When $\tau$ is shorter than the characteristic relaxation time, it has been observed that the maximum power is achieved when the value of $\tilde{x}_f$ is less than 2. In contrast, when cycle period times are longer than the characteristic relaxation time, the maximum power is achieved when the scaled feedback location $\tilde{x}_f$ is exactly at 2. As the $\tau$ increases, the maximum average power decreases. We found that the average extractable work and efficiency of the GBIE increases as the feedback location increases up to a certain point, after which it decreases. In the limit of a long $\tau$, the highest efficiency as well extractable work is attained when $\tilde{x}_f$ is located at 2, regardless of the level of entropic control. As the dominance of entropic control increases, the extractable work and efficiency in the fully relaxed state decrease due to higher information loss during relaxation.</description>

      <title>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in a Quantum Point Contact Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the long-range quantum entanglement exhibited in free fermion systems is sufficient to "thermalize" a small subsystem in that the subsystem reduced density matrix computed from a typical excited eigenstate of the combined system is approximately thermal. Remarkably, fermions without any interactions are thus thought to satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). We explore this hypothesis when the fermion subsystem is only minimally coupled to a quantum reservoir (in the form of another fermion system) through a quantum point contact (QPC). The entanglement entropy of two 2-d free fermion systems connected by one or more quantum point contacts (QPC) is examined at finite energy and in the ground state. When the combined system is in a typical excited state, it is shown that the entanglement entropy of a subsystem connected by a small number of QPCs is sub-extensive, scaling as the linear size of the subsystem ($L_A$). For sufficiently low energies ($E$) and small subsystems, it is demonstrated numerically that the entanglement entropy $S_A \sim L_A E$, what one would expect for the thermodynamics of a one-dimensional system. In this limit, we suggest that the entropy carried by each additional QPC is quantized using the one-dimensional finite size/temperature conformal scaling: $\Delta S_A = \alpha \log{(1/E)\sinh{(L_AE)}}$. The sub-extensive entropy in the case of a small number of QPCs should be contrasted with the expectation for both classical, ergodic systems and quantum chaotic systems wherein a restricted geometry might affect the equilibrium relaxation times, but not the equilibrium properties themselves, such as extensive entropy and heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of density in the non-equilibrium steady state of boundary-driven diffusive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diffusive system coupled to unequal boundary reservoirs eventually reaches a non-equilibrium steady state. While the full-counting-statistics of current in these non-equilibrium states are well understood for generic systems, results for steady-state density fluctuations remain limited to a few integrable models. By employing an exact solution of the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, we characterize steady-state density fluctuations in terms of large deviations for a class of systems. Additionally, we quantitatively describe the development of these rare fluctuations. For generic diffusive systems in arbitrary dimensions, we use a perturbation around the equilibrium state to solve for the large deviation functional and the corresponding path to fluctuations, up to non-trivial orders where the non-locality of fluctuations unveils.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of populations of weakly-coupled low-temperature-differential Stirling engines with synchronous and asynchronous transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study developed the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for populations of low-temperature-differential (LTD) Stirling engines weakly-coupled in a general class of networks to clarify the effects of synchronous and asynchronous transitions on the power and thermal efficiency. We first show that synchronous (asynchronous) transitions increase (decrease) the power and thermal efficiency of weakly-coupled LTD Stirling engines based on quasilinear response relations between formally defined thermodynamic fluxes and forces. After that, we construct a conceptual model satisfying the quasilinear response relations to give a physical interpretation of the changes in power and thermal efficiency due to synchronous and asynchronous transitions, and justify the use of this conceptual model. We then show that the conceptual model, rather than the quasilinear response relations, preserves the irreversible nature in the relative motion of the original model and thus shows more accurate results than the analysis using the quasilinear response relations. Finally, we compare the dynamics between the original and the conceptual models for two-engine systems and show that the conceptual model roughly preserves the dynamical characteristics leading up to the synchronous transitions, while some detailed dynamical structures are lost.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and transport in molten chloride salts and their mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molten salts are important in a number of energy applications, but the fundamental mechanisms operating in ionic liquids are poorly understood, particularly at higher temperatures. This is despite their candidacy for deployment in solar cells, next-generation nuclear reactors, and nuclear pyroprocessing. We perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations over a variety of molten chloride salt compositions at varying temperature and pressures to calculate the thermodynamic and transport properties of these liquids. Using recent developments in the theory of liquid thermophysical properties, we interpret our results on the basis of collective atomistic dynamics (phonons). We find that the properties of ionic liquids well explained by their collective dynamics, as in simple liquids. In particular, we relate the decrease of heat capacity, viscosity, and thermal conductivity to the loss of transverse phonons from the liquid spectrum. We observe the singular dependence of the isochoric heat capacity on the mean free path of phonons, and the obeyance of the Stokes-Einstein equation relating the viscosity to the mass diffusion. The transport properties of mixtures are more complicated compared to simple liquids, however viscosity and thermal conductivity are well guided by fundamental bounds proposed recently. The kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity lie very close to one another and obey the theoretical fundamental bounds determined solely by fundamental physical constants. Our results show that recent advances in the theoretical physics of liquids are applicable to molten salts mixtures, and therefore that the evolution and interplay of properties common to all liquids may act as a guide to a deeper understanding of these mixtures.</description>

      <title>Distribution of regularized three-body phase-volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The micro-canonical phase-space volume for the three-body problem is a topic of intrinsic interest. Within the flux-based statistical theory, it provides a means to predict the scale of disintegration times for non-hierarchical systems. While the bare phase-volume diverges, arXiv:2205.04294 (Paper I) showed that a regularized version can be defined. Building on Paper I, which determined the regularized phase-volume for a given energy $\bar\sigma(E)$, this paper extends the analysis to its distribution over angular momentum, $\bar\sigma(E,L)$. Through analytical integrations, we reduce the problem to a 3d numerical integration, a step up in complexity from the 2d integration required for $\bar\sigma(E)$. We provide regularized phase-volume values for several mass sets across a range of $E$ and $L$, validated through an $L$-integration test. Notably, the values remain positive for all tested parameters, lending further support to the validity of the chosen regularization procedure. For high values of $L$ at fixed masses and $E$, we observe a strong suppression of $\bar\sigma(E,L)$.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-assisted reverse annealing on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing has garnered significant attention as meta-heuristics inspired by quantum physics for combinatorial optimization problems. Among its many applications, nonnegative/binary matrix factorization stands out for its complexity and relevance in unsupervised machine learning. The use of reverse annealing, a derivative procedure of quantum annealing to prioritize the search in a vicinity under a given initial state, helps improve its optimization performance in matrix factorization. This study proposes an improved strategy that integrates reverse annealing with a linear programming relaxation technique. Using relaxed solutions as the initial configuration for reverse annealing, we demonstrate improvements in optimization performance comparable to the exact optimization methods. Our experiments on facial image datasets show that our method provides better convergence than known reverse annealing methods. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of relaxation-based initialization methods on randomized datasets, demonstrating a relationship between the relaxed solution and the optimal solution. This research underscores the potential of combining reverse annealing and classical optimization strategies to enhance optimization performance.</description>

      <title>Jamming transition and normal modes of polydispersed soft particle packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of soft particles characterized by narrow size distributions has been well studied by physicists. However, polydispersed systems are more relevant to engineering, and the influence of polydispersity on jamming phenomena is still unexplored. Here, we numerically investigate jamming transitions of polydispersed soft particles in two dimensions. We find that polydispersity strongly influences contact forces, local coordination, and the jamming transition density. In contrast, the critical scaling of pressure and elastic moduli is not affected by the particle size distribution. Consistent with this observation, we find that the vibrational density of states is also insensitive to the polydispersity. Our results suggest that, regardless of particle size distributions, both mechanical and vibrational properties of soft particle packings near jamming are governed by the distance to jamming.</description>

      <title>Decoding active force fluctuations from spatial trajectories of active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesoscopic active systems exhibit various unique behaviours - absent in passive systems - due to the forces generated by the corresponding constituents by converting their available free energies. However, finding out these forces - which are also stochastic and remain intertwined with the thermal noise - is especially non-trivial. Here, we introduce a technique to extract such fluctuating active forces, with statistical accuracy, acting on a passive particle immersed in an active bath by filtering out the related thermal noise. First, we test the efficacy of our method under numerical scenarios and then apply it to the experimental trajectories of a microscopic particle (optically) trapped inside an active bath consisting of motile E.Coli. bacteria. We believe that our approach would be rather effective in the actual measurement of unknown active forces, which are a crucial component in processes involving living matter.</description>

      <title>Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass: role of non-affine flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effect reflects a system's ability to encode, retain and retrieve information about its past. Such effects are essentially an out-of-equilibrium phenomenon providing insight into the complex structural and dynamical behavior of the system. Kovacs effect is one such memory effect that is traditionally associated with thermal history. Although studies on the Kovacs-like memory effect have been extended to mechanical perturbations such as compression-decompression, whether such effects can also be observed under volume-conserving perturbations like shear, remains unclear. Combining experiments, simulations and linear response theory we demonstrate Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass. Moreover, we explore the influence of non-linear perturbations and establish a correlation between the deviation from linear response prediction and microscopic non-affine flows generated due to such large deformations in affecting the memory effect. Our study not only extends Kovacs-like memory effect in the domain of volume-conserving mechanical perturbations, it also highlights the importance of the nature of underlying microscopic flows in controlling the memory effect in amorphous matter.</description>

Abstract: We study the classification problem of mixed states in two-dimensional quantum spin systems in the operator algebraic framework of quantum statistical mechanics. We associate a braided $C^*$-tensor category to each state satisfying a mixed-state version of the approximate Haag duality. We study how this category behaves under decoherence: suppose the state is acted by a finite depth quantum channel. We prove that the braided $C^*$-tensor category of the final state is a braided $C^*$-tensor subcategory of the initial state.</description>

Abstract: Surfacic networks are structures built upon a two-dimensional manifold. Many systems, including transportation networks and various urban networks, fall into this category. The fluctuations of node elevations imply significant deviations from typical plane networks and require specific tools to understand their impact. Here, we present such tools, including lazy paths that minimize elevation differences, graph arduousness which measures the tiring nature of shortest paths, and the excess effort, which characterizes positive elevation variations along shortest paths. We illustrate these measures using toy models of surfacic networks and empirically examine pedestrian networks in selected cities. Specifically, we examine how changes in elevation affect the spatial distribution of betweenness centrality. We also demonstrate that the excess effort follows a non-trivial power law distribution, with an exponent that is not universal, which illustrates that there is a significant probability of encountering steep slopes along shortest paths, regardless of the elevation difference between the starting point and the destination. These findings highlight the significance of elevation fluctuations in shaping network characteristics. Surfacic networks offer a promising framework for comprehensively analyzing and modeling complex systems that are situated on or constrained to a surface environment.</description>

      <title>Limiting distributions of generalized money exchange models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "Money Exchange Model" is a type of agent-based simulation model used to study how wealth distribution and inequality evolve through monetary exchanges between individuals. The primary focus of this model is to identify the limiting wealth distributions that emerge at the macroscopic level, given the microscopic rules governing the exchanges among agents. In this paper, we formulate generalized versions of the immediate exchange model and the uniform saving model both of which are types of money exchange models, as discrete-time interacting particle systems and characterize their stationary distributions. Furthermore, we prove that under appropriate scaling, the asymptotic wealth distribution converges to a Gamma distribution or an exponential distribution for both models. The limiting distribution depends on the weight function that affects the probability distribution of the number of coins exchanged by each agent. In particular, our results provide a mathematically rigorous formulation and generalization of the assertions previously predicted in studies based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical self-assembly for high-yield addressable complexity at fixed conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is evidence that the self-assembly of complex molecular systems often proceeds hierarchically, by first building subunits that later assemble in larger entities, in a process that can repeat multiple times. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon and its performance is limited. Here we introduce a simple model for hierarchical addressable self-assembly, where interactions between particles can be optimised to maximise the fraction of a well-formed target structure, or yield. We find that a hierarchical strategy leads to an impressive yield up to at least five generations of the hierarchy, and does not require a cycle of temperatures as used in previous methods. High yield is obtained when the microscopic interaction decreases with the scale of units considered, such that the total interaction between intermediate structures remains identical at all scales. We provide thermodynamic and dynamical arguments constraining the interaction strengths where this strategy is effective. Overall, our work characterizes an alternative strategy for addressable self-assembly at a fixed temperature, and provides insight into the mechanisms sustaining hierarchical assembly in biology.</description>

      <title>Visualizing quantum entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates without state vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ring polymer self-consistent field theory is used to calculate the critical temperatures and heat capacities of an ideal Bose gas for an order of magnitude more particles than previously reported. A lambda-transition indicative of Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as expected. Using a known proof of spatial mode entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates, a relationship between boson exchange and quantum entanglement is established. This is done without the use of state vectors, since ring polymer quantum theory uses instead a thermal degree of freedom, sometimes called the "imaginary time", to map classical statistical mechanics onto non-relativistic quantum mechanics through the theorems of density functional theory. It is shown that quantum phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, boson exchange, entanglement and contextuality, can be visualized in terms of merging and separating ring polymer threads in thermal-space. A possible extension to fermions is mentioned.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>

      <title>Polarised crowd in motion: insights into statistical and dynamical behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collection of active agents often exhibits intriguing statistical and dynamical properties, particularly when considering human crowds. In this study, we have developed a computational model to simulate the recent experiment on real marathon races by Bain et al. Our primary goal is to investigate the impact of race staff on crowd dynamics. By comparing simulated races with and without the presence of race staff, our study reveals that the local velocity and density of participants display a wave pattern akin to real races for both the cases. The observed traveling wave in the crowd consistently propagates at a constant speed, regardless of the system size under consideration. The participants dynamics in the longitudinal direction primarily contribute to velocity fluctuations, while fluctuations in the transverse direction are suppressed. In the absence of race staff, density and velocity fluctuations weaken without significantly affecting other statistical and dynamic characteristics of the crowd. Through this research, we aim to deepen our understanding of crowd motion, providing insights that can inform the development of effective crowd management strategies and contribute to the successful control of such events.</description>

      <title>Restart uncertainty relation for monitored quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel time-energy uncertainty relation within the context of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Initially, we investigate the concept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum computer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a $2d$-conservative lattice gas exhibiting a dynamical active-absorbing phase transition with critical density $\rho_c$. We derive the hydrodynamic equation for this model, showing that all critical exponents governing the large scale behavior near criticality can be obtained from two independent ones. We show that as the supercritical density approaches criticality, distinct length scales naturally appear. Remarkably, this behavior is different from the subcritical one. Numerical simulations support the critical relations and the scale separation.</description>

      <title>The statistical mechanics and machine learning of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the so-called $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in mean-field theory in different regimes of the R\'enyi index $\alpha$. Next, we re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions, presenting analytical arguments for the former and devising a Monte Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi free energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with the use of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

Abstract: The potential applications of boundary functionals of random processes, such as the extreme values of these processes, the moment of first reaching a fixed level, the value of the process at the moment of reaching the level, the moment of reaching extreme values, the time the process stays above a fixed level, and other functionals, are considered for the description of physical, chemical, and biological problems. Definitions of these functionals are provided, and characteristic functions are presented for the model with an exponential distribution of incoming demands. A generalization of these limitations is also considered. The potential uses of boundary functionals are demonstrated through examples such as a unicyclic network with affinity A, an asymmetric random walk, nonlinear diffusion, two-level model, Brownian motion, and multiple diffusing particles with reversible target-binding kinetics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three types of cycles are identified in the quantum jump trajectories of the Scovil--Schulz-DuBois (SSDB) machine: an R-cycle as refrigeration, an H-cycle as a heat engine, and an N-cycle in which the machine is neutral. The statistics of these cycles are investigated via a semi-Markov process method. We find that in the large time limit, whether the machine operates as a heat engine or refrigerator depends on the ratio between the numbers of R-cycles and H-cycles per unit time. Further increasing the hot bath temperature above a certain threshold does not increase the machine's power output. The cause is that, in this situation, the N-cycle has a greater probability than the H-cycle and R-cycle. Although the SSDB machine operates by randomly switching between these three cycles, at the level of a single quantum jump trajectory, its heat engine efficiency and the refrigerator's coefficient of performance remain constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive physical phenomenon where a hot system cools faster than a warm one. In recent years, theoretical analyses of the Mpemba effect have been developed for microscopic systems and experimentally verified. However, the conventional theory relies on a specific choice of distance measure to quantify relaxation speed, leading to several theoretical ambiguities. In this Letter, we derive a rigorous quantification of the Mpemba effect based on thermomajorization theory, referred to as the thermomajorization Mpemba effect. This approach resolves all existing ambiguities and provides a unification of the conventional Mpemba effect across all monotone measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the thermomajorization Mpemba effect for Markovian dynamics, rigorously proving that it can occur in any temperature regime with fixed energy levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range correlations manifested as power spectral density scaling $1/f^\beta$ for frequency $f$ and a range of exponents $\beta$ are investigated for a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with distributed durations $\tau$. Closed-form expressions for the frequency power spectral density are derived for a one-sided exponential pulse function and several variants of bounded and unbounded power-law distributions of pulse durations ${P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^\alpha}$ with abrupt and smooth cutoffs. The asymptotic scaling relation $\beta=3-\alpha$ is demonstrated for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3$ in the limit of an infinitely broad distribution $P_\tau(\tau)$. Logarithmic corrections to the frequency scaling are exposed at the boundaries of the long-range dependence regime, $\beta=0$ and $\beta=2$. Analytically demonstrated finite-size effects associated with distribution truncations are shown to reduce the frequency ranges of scale invariance by several decades. The regimes of validity of the $\beta=3-\alpha$ relation are clarified.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive Characterization of Quantum Many-Body Scars using Commutant Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) in the language of commutant algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large "thermal" subspace and the small "non-thermal" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS, which demonstrates that QMBS survive under large classes of local perturbations. We illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic $\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these QMBS.Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to recover results of previous "brute-force" numerical searches for such Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we discuss its implications to dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hyperballistic transport in dense systems of charged particles under ac electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Langevin equation is ubiquitously employed to numerically simulate plasmas, colloids and electrolytes. However, the usual assumption of white noise becomes untenable when the system is subject to an external AC electric field. This is because the charged particles in the system, which provide the thermal bath for the particle transport, become themselves responsive to the AC field and the thermal noise is field-dependent and non-Markovian. We theoretically study the particle diffusivity in a Langevin transport model for a tagged charged particle immersed in a dense system of charged particles (plus also, possibly, other neutral particles) that act as the thermal bath, under an external AC electric field. This is done by properly accounting for the effects of the AC field on the thermal bath statistics. We analytically derive the time-dependent generalized diffusivity $D(t)$ for different initial conditions. The generalized diffusivity exhibits damped oscillatory-like behaviour with initial very large peaks, where the generalized diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the infinite-time steady-state value. The latter coincides with the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity in the absence of external field. For initial conditions where the external field is already on at $t=0$ and the system is thermalized under DC conditions for $t \leq 0$, the short-time behaviour is hyperballistic, $MSD \sim t^4$ (where MSD is the mean-squared displacement), leading to giant enhancement of the particle transport. Finally, the theory elucidates the role of medium polarization on the local Lorentz field, and allows for estimates of the effective electric charge due to polarization by the surrounding charges.</description>

      <title>A minimal scenario for the origin of non-equilibrium order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Life uses non-equilibrium mechanisms to create ordered structures not attainable at equilibrium; the resulting order is assumed to provide functional benefits that outweigh costs of time and energy needed by these mechanisms. Here, we show that models of DNA replication and self-assembly, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve error correcting mechanisms like kinetic proofreading and dynamic instability through selection for fast replication alone. We abstract these results into a general framework that predicts a counterintuitive ''order through speed'' effect if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. We test our results against recent mutational screens of proofreading polymerases. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can evolve even before that order is directly functional, with consequences for the evolution of mutation rates, viral capsid assembly, and the origin of life.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping frustrated magnets: the fate of the chiral ${\rm O}(N)\times {\rm O}(2)$ universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic modeling of the LiCl-KCl-LaCl$_3$ system with Bayesian model selection and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chloride molten salts are increasingly used in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding thermodynamic properties of these salts is essential to predict their critical characteristics and optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), have been utilized in the literature to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor is used to guide the model selection process for thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl3 system and provide statistical comparison of various models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable one based on available data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl3 system has been further modelled with uncertainty quantification (UQ) using MQMQA with the thermodynamic properties of compounds in KCl-LaCl3 predicted by the quasiharmonic approach in terms of first-principles phonon calculations as a function of temperature. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate thermodynamic model is important for accurately predicting critical characteristics of complex molten salts.</description>

      <title>On inequalities of shear modulus contributions in disordered elastic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate generic inequalities of various contributions to the shear modulus $\mu$ in ensembles of amorphous elastic bodies. We focus first on a simple elastic network model with connectivity matrices (CMs) which are either annealed or quenched, at or out of equilibrium. The stress-fluctuation formalism relation for $\mu$ is rewritten as $\mu = \mu_1 + \mu_a$ with $\mu_1 \ge 0$ characterizing the variance of the quenched shear stresses and $\mu_a$ being a simple average over all states and CMs. For equilibrium CM-distributions $\mu_a$ becomes equivalent to the shear modulus of annealed systems, i.e. $\mu_a \ge 0$, while more generally $\mu_a$ may become strongly negative as shown by considering a temperature quench and a scalar active two-temperature model. Consistent relations are also found for glass-forming colloids where $\mu-\mu_1=\mu_a=0$ for equilibrium ensembles, i.e. $\mu$ is set by the quenched shear stresses, while $\mu_a$ becomes again negative otherwise.</description>

      <title>Boundary Criticality in the 2d Random Quantum Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The edge of a quantum critical system can exhibit multiple distinct types of boundary criticality. We use a numerical real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to study the boundary criticality of a 2d quantum Ising model with random exchange couplings and transverse fields, whose bulk exhibits an infinite randomness critical point. This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.</description>

      <title>The orientational structure of a model patchy particle fluid: simulations, integral equations, density functional theory and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern--Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.</description>

      <title>Parisi-Sourlas Supertranslation and Scale without Conformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of 2 and 3 mutually intersecting conformal defects forming wedges and corners in general dimension. For 2 defects we derive the beta function of the edge interactions for infinite and semi-infinite wedges and study them in the tricritical model in $d=3-\epsilon$ as an example. We discuss the dependency of the edge anomalous dimension on the intersection angle, connecting to an old issue known in the literature. Additionally, we study trihedral corners formed by 3 planes and compute the corner anomalous dimension, which can be considered as a higher-dimensional analog of the cusp anomalous dimension. We also study 3-line corners related to the three-body potential of point-like impurities.</description>

      <title>All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

Abstract: We carefully review the hierarchical construction by Bouch [Bouch2015] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ denotes the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C&gt;1$ is a constant. (As discussed in Section IV.A of [ParkerCaoAvdoshkinScaffidiAltman2019] and Appendix A.3 of [ShiraishiTasaki2024], this result has an implication on the operator growth in quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions.)</description>
