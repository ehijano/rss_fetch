      <title>Modified Delayed Acceptance MCMC for Quasi-Bayesian Inference with Linear Moment Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a computationally efficient framework for quasi-Bayesian inference based on linear moment conditions. The approach employs a delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC) algorithm that uses a surrogate target kernel and a proposal distribution derived from an approximate conditional posterior, thereby exploiting the structure of the quasi-likelihood. Two implementations are introduced. DA-MCMC-Exact fully incorporates prior information into the proposal distribution and maximizes per-iteration efficiency, whereas DA-MCMC-Approx omits the prior in the proposal to reduce matrix inversions, improving numerical stability and computational speed in higher dimensions. Simulation studies on heteroskedastic linear regressions show substantial gains over standard MCMC and conventional DA-MCMC baselines, measured by multivariate effective sample size per iteration and per second. The Approx variant yields the best overall throughput, while the Exact variant attains the highest per-iteration efficiency. Applications to two empirical instrumental variable regressions corroborate these findings: the Approx implementation scales to larger designs where other methods become impractical, while still delivering precise inference. Although developed for moment-based quasi-posteriors, the proposed approach also extends to risk-based quasi-Bayesian formulations when first-order conditions are linear and can be transformed analogously. Overall, the proposed algorithms provide a practical and robust tool for quasi-Bayesian analysis in statistical applications.</description>

      <title>Trust-Aware Multimodal Data Fusion for Yield Estimation: A Case Study of the 2020 Beirut Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of explosive yield from heterogeneous observational data presents fundamental challenges in inverse problems, particularly when combining traditional physical measurements with modern artificial intelligence-interpreted modalities. We present a novel Bayesian fractional posterior framework that fuses seismic waves, crater dimensions, synthetic aperture radar imagery, and vision-language model interpreted ground-level images to estimate the yield of the 2020 Beirut explosion. Unlike conventional approaches that may treat data sources equally, our method learns trust weights for each modality through a Dirichlet prior, automatically calibrating the relative information content of disparate observations. Applied to the Beirut explosion, the framework yields an estimate of 0.34--0.48 kt TNT equivalent, representing 12 to 17 percent detonation efficiency relative to the 2.75 kt theoretical maximum from the blast's stored ammonium nitrate. The fractional posterior approach demonstrates superior uncertainty quantification compared to single-modality estimates while providing robustness against systematic biases. This work establishes a principled framework for integrating qualitative assessments with quantitative physical measurements, with applications to explosion monitoring, disaster response, and forensic analysis.</description>

      <title>Effects of Distance Metrics and Scaling on the Perturbation Discrimination Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Perturbation Discrimination Score (PDS) is increasingly used to evaluate whether predicted perturbation effects remain distinguishable, including in Systema and the Virtual Cell Challenge. However, its behavior in high-dimensional gene-expression settings has not been examined in detail. We show that PDS is highly sensitive to the choice of similarity or distance measure and to the scale of predicted effects. Analysis of observed perturbation responses reveals that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$-based PDS behave very differently from cosine-based measures, even after norm matching. We provide geometric insight and discuss implications for future discrimination-based evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Covariate Connectivity Combined Clustering for Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a central task in network analysis, with applications in social, biological, and technological systems. Traditional algorithms rely primarily on network topology, which can fail when community signals are partly encoded in node-specific attributes. Existing covariate-assisted methods often assume the number of clusters is known, involve computationally intensive inference, or are not designed for weighted networks. We propose $\text{C}^4$: Covariate Connectivity Combined Clustering, an adaptive spectral clustering algorithm that integrates network connectivity and node-level covariates into a unified similarity representation. $\text{C}^4$ balances the two sources of information through a data-driven tuning parameter, estimates the number of communities via an eigengap heuristic, and avoids reliance on costly sampling-based procedures. Simulation studies show that $\text{C}^4$ achieves higher accuracy and robustness than competing approaches across diverse scenarios. Application to an airport reachability network demonstrates the method's scalability, interpretability, and practical utility for real-world weighted networks.</description>

      <title>Iterating marginalized Bayes maps for likelihood maximization with application to nonlinear panel models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamic systems can be investigated by fitting mechanistic stochastic dynamic models to time series data. In this context, commonly used Monte Carlo inference procedures for model selection and parameter estimation quickly become computationally unfeasible as the system dimension grows. The increasing prevalence of panel data, characterized by multiple related time series, therefore necessitates the development of inference algorithms that are effective for this class of high-dimensional mechanistic models. Nonlinear, non-Gaussian mechanistic models are routinely fitted to time series data but seldom to panel data, despite its widespread availability, suggesting that the practical difficulties for existing procedures are prohibitive. We investigate the use of iterated filtering algorithms for this purpose. We introduce a novel algorithm that contains a marginalization step that mitigates issues arising from particle filtering in high dimensions. Our approach enables likelihood-based inference for models that were previously considered intractable, thus broadening the scope of dynamic models available for panel data analysis.</description>

      <title>Divide, Interact, Sample: The Two-System Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean-field, ensemble-chain, and adaptive samplers have historically been viewed as distinct approaches to Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we present a unifying {two-system} framework that brings all three under one roof. In our approach, an ensemble of particles is split into two interacting subsystems that propose updates for each other in a symmetric, alternating fashion. This cross-system interaction ensures that the overall ensemble has $\rho(x)$ as its invariant distribution in both the finite-particle setting and the mean-field limit. The two-system construction reveals that ensemble-chain samplers can be interpreted as finite-$N$ approximations of an ideal mean-field sampler; conversely, it provides a principled recipe to discretize mean-field Langevin dynamics into tractable parallel MCMC algorithms. The framework also connects naturally to adaptive single-chain methods: by replacing particle-based statistics with time-averaged statistics from a single chain, one recovers analogous adaptive dynamics in the long-time limit without requiring a large ensemble. We derive novel two-system versions of both overdamped and underdamped Langevin MCMC samplers within this paradigm. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world posterior inference tasks, these two-system samplers exhibit significant performance gains over the popular No-U-Turn Sampler, achieving an order of magnitude higher effective sample sizes per gradient evaluation.</description>
