      <title>Discrete functional inequalities on lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study problems at the interface of analysis and discrete mathematics. We discuss analogues of well known Hardy-type inequalities and Rearrangement inequalities on the lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, with a particular focus on behaviour of sharp constants and optimizers.In the first half of the thesis, we analyse Hardy inequalities on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, first for $d=1$ and then for $d \geq 3$. We prove a sharp weighted Hardy inequality on integers with power weights of the form $n^\alpha$. This is done via two different methods, namely super-solution and Fourier method. We also use Fourier method to prove a weighted Hardy type inequality for higher order operators. After discussing the one dimensional case, we study the Hardy inequality in higher dimensions ($d \geq 3$). In particular, we compute the asymptotic behaviour of the sharp constant in the discrete Hardy inequality, as $d \rightarrow \infty$. This is done by converting the inequality into a continuous Hardy-type inequality on a torus for functions having zero average. These continuous inequalities are new and interesting in themselves.
  In the second half, we focus our attention on analogues of Rearrangement inequalities on lattice graphs. We begin by analysing the situation in dimension one. We define various notions of rearrangements and prove the corresponding Polya-Szeg\H{o} inequality. These inequalities are also applied to prove some weighted Hardy inequalities on integers. Finally, we study Rearrangement inequalities (Polya-Szeg\H{o}) on general graphs, with a particular focus on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d \geq 2$. We develop a framework to study these inequalities, using which we derive concrete results in dimension two. In particular, these results develop connections between Polya-Szeg\H{o} inequality and various isoperimetric inequalities on graphs.</description>

      <title>On a Nonlocal Integral Operator Commuting with the Laplacian and the Sturm-Liouville Problem I: Low Rank Perturbations of the Operator</title>

Abstract: We reformulate all general real coupled self-adjoint boundary value problems as integral operators and show that they are all finite rank perturbations of the free space Green's function on the real line. This free space Green's function corresponds to the nonlocal boundary value problem proposed earlier by Saito [N. Saito, Appl. Comput. Harmonic Anal., 25, 68--97 (2008)]. We prove these perturbations to be polynomials of rank up to 4. They encapsulate in a fundamental way the corresponding boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Connecting topological strings and spectral theory via non-autonomous Toda equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Topological String/Spectral theory duality on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from the resolution of the cone over the $Y^{N,0}$ singularity. Assuming Kyiv formula, we demonstrate this duality in a special regime thanks to an underlying connection between spectral determinants of quantum mirror curves and the non-autonomous (q)-Toda system. We further exploit this link to connect small and large time expansions in Toda equations. In particular we provide an explicit expression for their tau functions at large time in terms of a strong coupling version of irregular $W_N$ conformal blocks at $c=N-1$. These are related to a special class of multi-cut matrix models which describe the strong coupling regime of four dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills.</description>
