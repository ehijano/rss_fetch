      <title>Tuning electrochemical properties and thermal stability of YSZ mesoporous thin films for SOFC applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense and mesoporous 4% mol Yttria-stabilized zirconia thin films were deposited on amorphous silica substrates. The effects of the temperature on the mesostructure were analyzed, by applying different thermal treatments to the samples within the range of SOFC operation conditions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements rendered evidence of a single mechanism, consistent with grain boundary/surface oxide ion conduction. Our results show that the presence of the highly accessible porosity improves the superficial ionic conductivity, reducing the activation energy of the overall process. Density functional theory calculations on the (110) surface were performed to estimate the associated energy barriers. Our results suggest that ionic transport along the surface of accessible pores connected to the atmosphere could account for the observed reduction in activation energy.</description>

      <title>Designing Flat Bands, Localized and Itinerant States in TaS2 Trilayer Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking and twisting van der Waals materials provide a powerful tool to design quantum matter and engineer electron correlation. For instance, monolayers of 1T- and 1H-TaS2 are Mott insulating and metallic (also superconducting), respectively, and thus, the T/H bilayer systems have been extensively investigated in the context of heavy fermions and unconventional superconductivity, which are expected phases from localized spins (1T) coexisting with itinerant electrons (1H). However, recent studies revealed that significant charge transfer from the 1T to 1H layers removes the 1T Mottness and renders the above scenario elusive. In this work, we propose a T/T/H trilayer heterostructure by combining a T/T bilayer -- which is a band insulator with flat dispersion -- with a 1H layer. After charge redistribution, this trilayer heterostructure shows localized spins in the Mott flat band of the T/T bilayer and weak spin polarization in the metallic H layer. We argue that by varying the stacking configurations of the T/T bilayer in the T/T/H trilayer, a crossover from a doped Mott insulator to a Kondo insulator can be achieved. The T/T/H trilayer provides therefore a rich novel heterostructure platform to study strong correlation phenomena and unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>A Map of the Zintl AM2Pn2 Compounds: Influence of Chemistry on Stability and Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AM2Pn2 (A= Ca, Sr, Ba, Yb, Mg; M= Mn, Zn, Cd, Mg; and Pn=N, P, As, Sb, Bi) family of Zintl phases has been known as thermoelectric materials and has recently gained much attention for highly promising materials for solar absorbers in single junction and tandem solar cells. In this paper we will, from first-principles, explore the entire family of AM2Pn2 compounds in terms of their ground state structure, thermodynamic stability, and electronic structure. We also perform photoluminescence spectroscopy on bulk powder and thin film samples to verify our results, including the first measurements of the bandgaps of SrCd2P2 and CaCd2P2. The AM2Pn2 compounds exhibit broad stability, are mostly isostructural in the CaAl2Si2-type structure (P3m1), and cover a wide range of bandgaps from 0 to beyond 3 eV. This could make them useful for a variety of purposes, for which we propose several candidates, such as CaZn2N2 for tandem top cell solar absorbers and SrCd2Sb2 and CaZn2Sb2 for infrared detectors. By examining the band structures of the AM2Pn2, we find that Mg3Sb2 has the most promise as a thermoelectric material due to several off-{\Gamma} valence band pockets which are unique to it among the compositions studied here.</description>

      <title>Effects of altermagnetic order, strain and doping on the optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RuO$_2$, one of the most widely studied transition metal oxides, was recently predicted to host a novel form of collinear magnetic order referred to as altermagnetism. In this study we combine experiment (reflectance, transmittance, ellipsometry and Raman measurements) and first-principles calculations to elucidate the potential role of altermagnetic order, strain and doping on the optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$ grown on TiO$_2$ (001), (101) and (110) substrates. The combination of experiment and theory in this study surprisingly indicates RuO$_2$ is in fact best described if one assumes the nonmagnetic state. Calculations of the altermagnetic state leads to poor agreement with the measured optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Strain Relaxation-Induced Directional Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics in RuO2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast light-matter interactions inspire potential functionalities in picosecond optoelectronic applications. However, achieving directional carrier dynamics in metals remains challenging due to strong carrier scattering within a multiband environment, typically expected to isotropic carrier relaxation. In this study, we demonstrate epitaxial RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy to engineer polarization-selectivity of ultrafast light-matter interactions via anisotropic strain engineering. Combining spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we revealed the strong anisotropic transient optoelectronic response of strain-engineered RuO2/TiO2 (110) heterostructures along both in-plane [001] and [1-10] crystallographic directions. Theoretical analysis identifies strain-induced modifications in band nesting as the underlying mechanism for enhanced anisotropic carrier relaxation. These findings establish epitaxial strain engineering as a powerful tool for tuning anisotropic optoelectronic responses in metallic systems, paving the way for next-generation polarization-sensitive ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Recent Progress in Studies of Cobalt-based Quasi-1-dimensional Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of crystal electric field, temperature, and spin-orbit coupling can yield a Kramers ion and thus an effective S = 1/2 ground state for Co2+ ions (3d7), which is often the case for low dimensional materials. This is because a highly anisotropic structural motif can force the spins to point either up or down, hence becoming a system where spins communicate via Ising interactions. Cobalt-based quasi-1-dimensional materials have been studied in this context since the latter half of the 20th century, but due to the development of modern characterization techniques and advances in sample preparation, the exotic physical phenomena that have generated the most interest have only emerged in the most recent three to four decades. This topical review mainly summarizes progress in cobalt-based quasi-1-dimensional quantum magnets, and comments on a few research directions of potential future interest.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Zeolites as High-Performance Electrode Protective Layers for Alkali-Metal Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrode-electrolyte interfaces play pivotal roles in alkali-metal batteries, necessitating superior electrochemical stability, excellent electrical insulation, and high ionic conductivity. This study proposes using zeolites as interfacial protective layers owing to their inherently high stability with both alkali metals and high-voltage cathodes, as well as exceptionally wide bandgaps that minimize electron transport. To further pinpoint zeolites with rapid ionic diffusivity among their versatile structures, we devise a universal approach to explore diffusion dynamics in arbitrary structures. Through first-principles calculations, we identify the diffusion networks of Li+, Na+, and K+ in twenty-two, seventeen, and four zeolites, respectively. Eventually, we predict five, seven, and three zeolites as suitable interfacial protective layer for lithium-, sodium-, and potassium-metal batteries, respectively, each characterized by a diffusion barrier below 0.3 eV. This research automates the exploration of diffusion dynamics in complex materials and underscores the significant potential of zeolites as interfacial protective layers in alkali-metal batteries.</description>

      <title>Eliminating nanometer-scale asperities on metallic thin films through plasma modification processes studied by molecular dynamics and AFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the effects of reducing surface asperity size at the nanometer scale on metallic surfaces by plasma-assisted surface modification processes using simulations and experiments. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted by irradiating various inert gas ions (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) onto a cobalt slab with nanoscale asperities on the surface. The MD simulations showed that as the atomic number of the inert gas increased the surface asperity size was reduced more efficiently, while the etching rate decreased. The dependencies of the scattering behaviors on the inert gas ions originated from the mass exchange between the working gas ions and the slab atoms. Atomic force microscopy and x-ray fluorescence measurements were performed on hard disk media subjected to the surface modification processes. These measurements experimentally demonstrated that the density of nanoscale asperities was reduced with a lower etching rate as the atomic number of the inert gas increased, consistent with the simulation results. Through this study, we clarified that heavier working gases were more effective in reducing surface asperity size without significantly reducing the thickness of the material, which can contribute to better control of surface morphologies at the nanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Polarization Switching in Al0.92Sc0.08N/GaN Heterostructures Grown by Sputter Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectric nitride thin films such as Al1-xScxN onto GaN templates could enable enhanced functionality in novel high-power transistors and memory devices. This requires a detailed understanding of the ferroelectric domain structures and their impact on the electric properties. In this contribution, the sputter epitaxy of highly coherent Al0.92Sc0.08N thin films grown on GaN approaching lattice-matching conditions is demonstrated. Scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations reveal the formation of polar domains and the mechanism of domain propagation upon ferroelectric switching. Atomic resolution imaging suggests that polarization inversion is initiated by an interfacial switching process in which already the first atomic layer of Al1-xScxN changes its polarization from the as-grown M- to N-polarity. An atomically sharp planar polarization discontinuity is identified at the Al0.92Sc0.08N/GaN interface and described by atomic modeling and chemical structure analysis using electron energy loss spectroscopy, considering local lattice spacings. Moreover, residual domains with M-polarity are identified at the top Pt electrode interface. These insights on the location and the atomic structure of ferroelectric inversion domains in sputter deposited Al1-xScxN/GaN heterostructures will support the development of future non-volatile memory devices and novel HEMT structures based on ferroelectric nitride thin films via interface engineering.</description>

      <title>Modelling spin-orbitronics effects at interfaces and chiral molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using orbital angular momentum (OAM) currents in nanoelectronics, for example, for magnetization manipulation via spin-orbit torque (SOT), represents a growing field known as "spin-orbitronics". Here, using the density functional theory (DFT) and the real-time dynamics of electronic wave packets, we explore a possibility of generation and propagation of orbital currents in two representative systems: an oxidized Cu surface (where large OAMs are known to form at the Cu/O interface) and a model molecular junction made of two carbon chains connected by a chiral molecule. In the Cu/O system, the orbital polarization of an incident wave packet from the Cu lead is strongly enhanced at the Cu/O interface but then rapidly decays in the bulk Cu due to orbital quenching of asymptotic bulk states. Interestingly, if a finite transmission across the oxygen layer is allowed (in a tunnel junction geometry, for example), a significant spin-polarization of transmitted (or reflected) currents is instead predicted which persists at a much longer distance and can be further tuned by an applied in-plane voltage. For the molecular junction, the mixing of the carbon $p_x$ and $p_y$ (degenerate) channels by the chiral molecular orbital gives rise not only to an efficient generation of orbital current but also to its long-range propagation along the carbon chain.</description>

      <title>The quest for new materials: the network theory and machine learning perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the emergence of novel materials is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, materials science and technology. With the rapid growth of materials databases in both size and reliability, the challenge shifts from data collection to efficient exploration of this vast and complex space. A key strategy lies in a smart use of descriptors at multiple scales, ranging from atomic arrangements to macroscopic properties, to represent materials in high-dimensional abstract spaces. Network theory provides a powerful framework to structure and analyze these relationships, capturing hidden patterns and guiding discovery. Machine Learning complements this approach by enabling predictive modeling, dimensionality reduction, and the identification of promising material candidates. By integrating network-based methods with Machine Learning techniques, researchers can construct, analyze, and efficiently navigate the material space, uncovering novel materials with tailored properties. This review explores the synergy between network theory and ML, highlighting their role in accelerating materials discovery through a systematic and interpretable approach.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the matrix effect on a compositionally graded oxide thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A heterostructure of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$/La$_{1.1}$Sr$_{0.9}$NiO$_3$ /SrTiO$_3$ has been analysed by magnetic sector secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The stoichiometry parameter $x$ of the top layer was made varying continuously from 0 to 1 along the width of the sample by combinatorial pulsed laser deposition. Prior to SIMS analysis, the composition gradient of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$ was quantitatively characterized by chemical characterizations including wavelength and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopies. Even if the Ti content is constant into Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3${}, its ionic yield exhibits an increasing trend as Ba is substituted by Sr. Such a phenomenon can be explained by the variation of the neighbouring atoms chemistry which affects the ionization probability of titanium during the sputtering process. In addition to the continuously varying composition, the oxide multilayer sample features sharp interfaces hence the in-depth resolution under our analysing conditions has been investigated too. The modelling of the interface crossing profiles reveals that the instrumental contribution to the profile broadening is as low as 5 nm.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Enhanced Variational Autoencoder for Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure forms the foundation for understanding the physical and chemical properties of materials. Generative models have emerged as a new paradigm in crystal structure prediction(CSP), however, accurately capturing key characteristics of crystal structures, such as periodicity and symmetry, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-Enhanced Variational Autoencoder for Crystal Structure Prediction (TransVAE-CSP), who learns the characteristic distribution space of stable materials, enabling both the reconstruction and generation of crystal structures. TransVAE-CSP integrates adaptive distance expansion with irreducible representation to effectively capture the periodicity and symmetry of crystal structures, and the encoder is a transformer network based on an equivariant dot product attention mechanism. Experimental results on the carbon_24, perov_5, and mp_20 datasets demonstrate that TransVAE-CSP outperforms existing methods in structure reconstruction and generation tasks under various modeling metrics, offering a powerful tool for crystal structure design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Broadband photoresponse enhancement by band engineering in Sb-doped MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials have attracted considerable attention for their potential in broadband and fast photoresponse, particularly in the infrared regime. However, the high carrier concentration in these systems often leads to rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers, limiting the photoresponsivity. Here, we demonstrate that Sb doping in MnBi2Te4 effectively reduces carrier concentration and suppresses electron-hole recombination, thereby significantly improving the optoelectronic performance across the visible to mid-infrared spectra. The optimally doped Mn(Bi0.82Sb0.18)2Te4 photodetector achieves a responsivity of 3.02 mA W-1 with a response time of 18.5 {\mu}s at 1550 nm, and 0.795 mA W-1 with a response time of 9.0 {\mu}s at 4 {\mu}m. These values represent nearly two orders of magnitude improvement compared to undoped MnBi2Te4. Our results highlight band engineering as an effective strategy to enhance the infrared performance of topological material-based photodetectors, opening new avenues for high-sensitivity infrared detection.</description>

      <title>Unexpected large electrostatic gating by pyroelectric charge accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyroelectricity refers to the accumulation of charges due to changes in the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials when subjected to temperature variations. Typically, these pyroelectric charges are considered unstable and dissipate quickly through interactions with the external environment. Consequently, the pyroelectric effect has been largely overlooked in ferroelectric field-effect transistors. In this work, we leverage the van der Waals interface of hBN to achieve a substantial and long-term electrostatic gating effect in graphene devices via the pyroelectric properties of a ferroelectric LiNbO3 substrate. Upon cooling, the polarization change in LiNbO3 induces high doping concentrations up to 1013 cm-2 in the adjacent graphene. Through a combination of transport measurements and non-contact techniques, we demonstrate that the pyroelectric charge accumulation, as well as its enhancement in electric fields, are responsible for this unexpectedly high doping level. Our findings introduce a novel mechanism for voltage-free electrostatic gating control with long retention.</description>

      <title>Excess energy and countercurrents after a quantum kick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum system of interacting particles under the effect of a static external potential is hereby described as kicked when that potential suddenly starts moving with a constant velocity v. If initially in a stationary state, the excess energy at any time after the kick equals $v \langle P \rangle (t)$, with P being the total momentum of the system. If the system is finite and remains bound, the long time average of the excess energy tends to $Mv^2$, with M the system's total mass, or a related expression if there is particle emission. $Mv^2$ is twice what expected from an infinitely smooth onset of motion, and any monotonic onset is expected to increase the average energy to a value within both limits. In a macroscopic system, a particle flow emerges countering the potential's motion when electrons stay partially behind. For charged particles the described kinetic kick is equivalent to the kick given by the infinitely short electric-field pulse $E = \frac{m}{q} v \delta (t)$ to the system at rest, useful as a formal limit in ultrafast phenomena. A linear-response analysis of low-v countercurrents in kicked metals shows that the coefficient of the linear term in v is the Drude weight. Non-linear in v countercurrents are expected for insulators through the electron-hole excitations induced by the kick, going as $v^3$ at low v for centrosymmetric ones. First-principles calculations for simple solids are used to ratify those predictions, although the findings apply more generally to systems such as Mott insulators or cold lattices of bosons or fermions.</description>

      <title>DiffRenderGAN: Addressing Training Data Scarcity in Deep Segmentation Networks for Quantitative Nanomaterial Analysis through Differentiable Rendering and Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomaterials exhibit distinctive properties governed by parameters such as size, shape, and surface characteristics, which critically influence their applications and interactions across technological, biological, and environmental contexts. Accurate quantification and understanding of these materials are essential for advancing research and innovation. In this regard, deep learning segmentation networks have emerged as powerful tools that enable automated insights and replace subjective methods with precise quantitative analysis. However, their efficacy depends on representative annotated datasets, which are challenging to obtain due to the costly imaging of nanoparticles and the labor-intensive nature of manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffRenderGAN, a novel generative model designed to produce annotated synthetic data. By integrating a differentiable renderer into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, DiffRenderGAN optimizes textural rendering parameters to generate realistic, annotated nanoparticle images from non-annotated real microscopy images. This approach reduces the need for manual intervention and enhances segmentation performance compared to existing synthetic data methods by generating diverse and realistic data. Tested on multiple ion and electron microscopy cases, including titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$), silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$)), and silver nanowires (AgNW), DiffRenderGAN bridges the gap between synthetic and real data, advancing the quantification and understanding of complex nanomaterial systems.</description>

      <title>Spin Pumping in Magnetostrictive Galfenol Interfaced with Ta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of their advantages for memory and storage applications, the quest to find suitable magnetic thin film heterostructures that can exhibit strong spin pumping effect persists in the scientific community. Here, we investigate the spin pumping phenomenon in Galfenol (FeGa) thin films by systematically varying the thickness of heavy metallic Ta underlayer (UL). Films exhibit soft magnetic properties with a bcc-phase and a notably low Gilbert damping is obtained for FeGa on Si (100). Further, we explore magnetic precessional dynamics of Ta/FeGa films using the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect technique, revealing the presence of a resonant Kittel mode and additional strain-induced modes. The lowest value of effective Gilbert damping is obtained as $\sim$ 0.015, which rises by $\sim$65\% as the thickness of UL increases. Spin pumping and two-magnon scattering mechanisms are validated using a ballistic spin transport model. We find an overall effective spin mixing conductance value of $\sim$5.48 $\times$ $10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is the highest value ever reported in magnetostrictive films. Additionally, we performed micromagnetic simulations to understand the effect of tilted magnetic anisotropy on the formation of magnetic modes in these films. These findings in FeGa films establish it as an effective spin source material and offer innovative ideas to control spin-wave propagation and diverse applications in straintronics.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Tuned Magnetism and Bandgap Modulation in Layered Fe-Doped CrCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the structural, magnetic, vibrational and optical band gap properties under varying pressures. By integrating first-principles calculations with experimental techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), uniaxial pressure studies (thermal expansion), and magnetization measurements, we unveil the intricate pressure-induced transformations in Fe-doped CrCl3, shedding light on its structural, electronic, and magnetic evolution. At ambient pressure, Raman spectra confirm all expected Raman-active modes, which exhibit blue shifts with increasing pressure. The PL measurements demonstrate an optical bandgap of 1.48 eV at ~0.6 GPa, with a progressive increase in the bandgap under pressure, transitioning slower above 6 GPa due to an isostructural phase transition. Magnetization results under pressure shows two competing magnetic components (FM and AFM) at ambient conditions, where at the lowest temperature and applied field, the FM component dominates. The presence of competing FM and AFM energy scales is confirmed by Grueneisen analysis of the thermal expansion and their uniaxial pressure dependence is determined. The experimental findings agree with theoretical results based on Density functional theory (DFT). In the experiments, we observe a pressure-enhanced ferromagnetic interlayer coupling that is followed by the stabilization of antiferromagnetic ordering, due to weakened direct interlayer interactions. Above 1.2 GPa the FM component of the magnetism is gone in the experimental observations, which is also in good agreement with DFT based theory. The findings reported here underscore the potential of CrCl3 for use in pressure-tunable magnetic and optoelectronic applications, where, e.g., the delicate balance between FM and AFM configurations could have potential for sensor applications.</description>

      <title>All-optical and ultrafast control of high-order exciton-polariton orbital modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons flows within closed quantum circuits can spontaneously form phase-locked modes that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). With its infinite set of angular momentum quantum numbers, high-order OAM represents a transformative solution to the bandwidth bottleneck in multiplexed optical communication. However, its practical application is hindered by the limited choice of materials which in general requires cryogenic temperatures and the reliance on mechanical switching. In this work, we achieve stable and high-order (up to order of 33) OAM modes by constructing a closed quantum circuit using the halide perovskite microcavities at room temperature. By controlling the spatial and temporal symmetry of the closed quantum circuits using another laser pulse, we achieve significant tuning OAM of EP flows from 8 to 12. Our work demonstrate all-optical and ultrafast control of high-order OAM using exciton-polariton condensates in perovskite microcavities that would have important applications in high-throughput optical communications.</description>

      <title>Apparent nonreciprocal transport in FeSe bulk crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed low-frequency ac first- and second-harmonic resistance measurements and dc $I-V$ measurements on bulk FeSe crystals in a temperature range between 1.8 and 150 K and in magnetic field up to 14 T. We observed considerable second-harmonic resistance, indicative of nonreciprocal charge transport, in some samples. By examining correlation between contact resistances and second-harmonic signals, we concluded that the second-harmonic resistance was not due to the genuine nonreciprocal transport effect but was caused by joule heating at a current contact through the thermoelectric effect. Our conclusion is consistent with a recent preprint (Nagata \textit{et al.}, arXiv:2409.01715), in which the authors reported a zero-field superconducting diode effect in devices fabricated with FeSe flakes and attributed it to the thermoelectric effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive understanding of the interactions that can occur at the interface between liquids and materials. It describes the phenomena of sorption (adsorption and absorption), permeation and leaching from a physicochemical perspective. In addition to examining these interactions, the historical context, detailing how these phenomena have been studied and demonstrated over time, it provides an understanding of the evolution of research in this field and the methodologies used to study these interactions, with a specific focus on polymer materials. The mechanisms underlying these interactions are presented as well as the equations that describe the processes involved, thus providing a scientific basis for understanding the complexities of container-content interactions.</description>

      <title>Computational discovery of high-refractive-index van der Waals materials: The case of HfS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New high-refractive-index dielectric materials may enhance many optical technologies by enabling efficient manipulation of light in waveguides, metasurfaces, and nanoscale resonators. Van der Waals materials are particularly promising due to their excitonic response and strong in-plane polarizability. Here we combine ab initio calculations and experiments to discover new high-refractive-index materials. Our screening highlights both known and new promising optical materials, including hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), which shows an in-plane refractive index above 3 and large anisotropy in the visible range. We confirm these theoretical predictions through ellipsometry measurements and investigate the photonic potential of HfS$_2$ by fabricating nanodisk resonators, observing optical Mie resonances in the visible spectrum. Over the course of seven days, we observe a structural change in HfS$_2$, which we show can be mitigated by storage in either argon-rich or humidity-reduced environments. This work provides a comparative overview of high-index van der Waals materials and showcases the potential of HfS$_2$ for photonic applications in the visible spectrum.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Theory of Current-Induced Motion of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topological spin textures that appear in magnets with broken spatial inversion symmetry via competition between the (anti)ferromagnetic exchange interactions and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a magnetic field. Their current-driven dynamics have been extensively studied aiming at spintronic applications. However, current-induced skyrmion motion exhibits diverse behaviors depending on various factors and conditions such as the type of skyrmion, driving mechanism, system geometry, direction of applied current, and type of the magnet. While this variety attracts enormous research interest of fundamental science and enriches their possibilities of technical applications, it is, at the same time, a source of difficulty and complexity that hinders their comprehensive understandings. In this article, we discuss fundamental and systematic theoretical descriptions of current-induced motion of skyrmions driven by the spin-transfer torque and the spin-orbit torque. Specifically, we theoretically describe the behaviors of current-driven skyrmions depending on the factors and conditions mentioned above by means of analyses using the Thiele equation. Furthermore, the results of the analytical theory are visually demonstrated and quantitatively confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. In particular, we discuss dependence of the direction and velocity of motion on the type of skyrmion (Bloch type and Neel type) and its helicity, the system geometry (thin plate and nanotrack), the direction of applied current (length and width direction of the nanotrack) and its spin-polarization orientation, and the type of magnet (ferromagnet and antiferromagnet). The comprehensive theory provided by this article is expected to contribute significantly to research on the manipulation and control of magnetic skyrmions by electric currents for future spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Physics of Multiferroic Perovskite Manganites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new type of multiferroicity was experimentally discovered in 2003 in a perovskite manganite TbMnO$_3$ where its ferroelectricity is induced by cycloidally ordered Mn spins. Susequently, such spin-cycloid multiferroic phase was also discovered in $R$MnO$_3$ with other rare-earth ions $R$=Dy, Eu$_{1-x}$Y$_x$, Tb$_{1-x}$Gd$_x$, etc. In this class of materials, the magnetism and ferroelectricity are inseparably coupled, and resulting strong magnetoelectric coupling enables us to control/manipulate the electricity (magnetism) by magnetic (electric) fields. Moreover, many interesting magnetoelectric phenomena due to their cross correlation have been discovered. In this article, we discuss a microscopic theoretical model for $R$MnO$_3$ constructed by taking into account their precise electronic and lattice structures and overview the theoretical works based on this model which elucidated rich magnetoelectric phenomena of $R$MnO$_3$. The perovskite manganites are not only the first-discovered spin-spiral multiferroic materials but also a typical class of materials that exhibits most of the magnetoelectric phenomena manifested in many other multiferroics. Therefore, the comprehensive understanding of $R$MnO$_3$ directly leads to the clarification of universal physics of magnetoelectric phenomena in multiferroic materials.</description>

      <title>Coherent detection of the oscillating acoustoelectric effect in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have emerged as a novel technique for generating quasiparticle transport and band modulation in condensed matter systems. SAWs interact with adjacent materials through piezoelectric and strain fields, dragging carriers in the direction of wave propagation. Most studies on the acoustoelectric effect have focused on the collective directional motion of carriers, which generates a steady electric potential difference, while the oscillating component from dynamic spatial charge modulation has remained challenging to probe. In this work, we report the coherent detection of oscillating acoustoelectric effect in graphene. This is achieved through the coherent rectification of spatial-temporal charge oscillation with electromagnetic waves emitted by interdigital transducers. We systematically investigate the frequency and gate dependence of rectified signals and quantitatively probe the carrier redistribution dynamics driven by SAWs. The observation of oscillating acoustoelectric effect provides direct access to the dynamic spatial charge modulation induced by SAWs through transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Shadow Molecular Dynamics for a Charge-Potential Equilibration Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a shadow molecular dynamics (MD) approach based on the Atom-Condensed Kohn-Sham second-order (ACKS2) charge-potential equilibration model. In contrast to regular flexible charge models, the ACKS2 model includes both flexible atomic charges and potential fluctuation parameters that allow for physically correct charge fragmentation and scaling of the polarizability. Our shadow MD scheme is based on an approximation of the ACKS2's flexible charge-potential energy function, in combination with extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer MD. Utilizing this shadow charge-potential equilibration approach mitigates the costly overhead and stability problems associated with finding well-converged iterative solutions to the charges and potential fluctuations of the ACKS2 model in an MD simulation. Our work provides a robust and versatile framework for efficient, high-fidelity MD simulations of diverse physical phenomena and applications.</description>

Abstract: Ferrimagnets in which half the spins are disordered and half ordered, so-called half-fire, half-ice state, have been advanced theoretically as a route towards realizing exotic magnetic ground states. Here we demonstrate novel single-spin resonance in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$, a 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice material. Using ac-susceptibility in the frequency range 0.1 Hz - 1 kHz we find a Debye-like resonance with Orbach relaxation temperature dependence, yielding an energy barrier $E_B \approx 840$ $k_B$ and attempt frequencies in the THz range. These quantities strongly suggest single-spin relaxation among paramagnetic Sm spins where the flipping field is provided by the FM-ordered Mn spins at domain boundaries, a direct outcome of the 1/3-fire, 2/3-ice state.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Tracking of Local and Collective Defects Dynamics in Metals Under Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metals owe their unique mechanical properties to how defects emerge and propagate within their crystal structure under stress. However, the mechanisms leading from the early emerging (local) defects to the amplification of dislocations (collective plastic events) are not easy to track. Here, using tensile-stress atomistic simulations of a Copper lattice as a case study, we revisit this classical problem under a new perspective based on local dynamics rather than on purely structural arguments. We use a data-driven approach that allows tracking how local fluctuations emerge and accumulate in the atomic lattice in space and time, anticipating/determining the emergence of local or collective structural defects during deformation. Building solely on the general concepts of local fluctuations and spatiotemporal fluctuation correlations, this approach allows characterizing in a unique way the evolution through the elastic, plastic, and fracture phases, describing metals as complex systems where collective phenomena originate from local dynamical triggering events.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Multiferroicity and Magnetoelectric coupling in Ca/Mn modified BaTiO3</title>

Abstract: Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are emerging field in modern technology and physics. BaTiO3 is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping has led to MEC. In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, {\alpha}ME ~88 mVcm-1Oe-1 was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.</description>

      <title>Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</description>

      <title>The balance between paraelectricity and ferroelectricity in non-chiral smectic homologs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption and luminescence of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter equation. We find a very strong optical absorption band related to transitions between the filled V-$d_{xy}$ like states to the empty ones with strong polarization along the $a$-direction. We relate this to recent experimental observations of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a supression of the CL was observed upon addition of Li.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization and Force Error Correction of Neuroevolution Potential for Predicting Thermal Conductivity of Wurtzite GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a representative of wide-bandgap semiconductors, wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) has been widely utilized in high-power devices due to high breakdown voltage and low specific on resistance. Accurate prediction of wurtzite GaN thermal conductivity is a prerequisite for designing effective thermal management systems of electronic applications. Machine learning driven molecular dynamics simulation offers a promising approach to predicting the thermal conductivity of large-scale systems without requiring predefined parameters. However, these methods often underestimate the thermal conductivity of materials with inherently high thermal conductivity due to the large predicted force error compared with first-principle calculation, posing a critical challenge for their broader application. In this study, we successfully developed a neuroevolution potential for wurtzite GaN and accurately predicted its thermal conductivity, 259 W/m-K at room temperatue, achieving excellent agreement with reported experimental measurements. The hyperparameters of neuroevolution potential (NEP) were optimized based on systematic analysis of reproduced energy and force, structural feature, computational efficiency. Furthermore, a force prediction error correction method was implemented, effectively reducing the error caused by the additional force noise in the Langevin thermostat by extrapolating to the zero-force error limit. This study provides valuable insights and hold significant implication for advancing efficient thermal management technologies in wide bandgap semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Softening of Vibrational Modes and Anharmonicity Induced Thermal Conductivity Reduction in a-Si:H at High Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has garnered considerable attention in the semiconductor industry, particularly for its use in solar cells and passivation layers for high performance silicon solar cells, owing to its exceptional photoelectric properties and scalable manufacturing processes. A comprehensive understanding of thermal transport mechanism in a-Si:H is essential for optimizing thermal management and ensuring the reliable operation of these devices. In this study, we developed a neuroevolution machine learning potential based on first-principles calculations of energy, forces, and virial, which enables accurate modeling of interatomic interactions in both a-Si:H and a-Si systems. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method, we systematically investigated the thermal conductivity of a-Si:H and a-Si across a temperature range of 300-1000 K and hydrogen concentrations ranging from 6 to 12 at%. Our simulation results found that thermal conductivity of a-Si:H with 12 at% hydrogen was significantly reduced by 12% compared to that of a-Si at 300 K. We analyzed the spectral thermal conductivity, vibrational density of states and lifetimes of vibrational modes, and revealed the softening of vibrational modes and anharmonicity effects contribute to the reduction of thermal conductivity as temperature and hydrogen concentration increase. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen concentration and temperature on diffuson and propagon contribution to thermal conductivity of a-Si:H was revealed. This study provides valuable insights for developing thermal management strategies in silicon-based semiconducting devices and advances the understanding of thermal transport in amorphous systems.</description>

      <title>Continuum theory of electrostatic-elastic coupling interactions in colloidal crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mobile Coulomb gas permeating a fixed background crystalline lattice of charged colloidal crystals is subject to an electrostatic-elastic coupling, which we study on the continuum level by introducing a minimal coupling between electrostatic and displacement fields. We derive linearized, Debye-H\"uckel-like mean-field equations that can be analytically solved, incorporating the minimal coupling between electrostatic and displacement fields leading to an additional effective attractive interaction between mobile charges that depends in general on the strength of the coupling between the electrostatic and displacement fields. By analyzing the Gaussian fluctuations around the mean-field solution we also identify and quantify the region of its stability in terms of the electrostatic-elastic screening length. This detailed continuum theory incorporating the standard lattice elasticity and electrostatics of mobile charges provides a baseline to investigate the electrostatic-elastic coupling for microscopic models in colloid science and materials science.</description>
