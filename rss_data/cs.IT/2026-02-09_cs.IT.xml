      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Aperiodic Doppler Resilient Complementary Sequence Sets Via Generalized Quasi-Florentine Rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doppler-resilient complementary sequence (DRCS) sets play a vital role in modern communication and sensing systems, particularly in high-mobility environments. This work makes two primary contributions. First, we refine the definition of quasi-Florentine rectangles to a more general form,termed generalized quasi-Florentine rectangles, and propose a systematic method for their construction. Second, we propose several sets of aperiodic DRCS based on generalized quasi Florentine rectangles and Butson-type Hadamard matrices. The proposed aperiodic DRCS sets are shown to be asymptotically optimal with respect to the lower bound of aperiodic DRCS sets.</description>

      <title>UAV-Mounted Aerial Relays in Military Communications: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relays are pivotal in military communication networks, expanding coverage and ensuring reliable connectivity in challenging operational environments. While traditional terrestrial relays (TR) are constrained by fixed locations and vulnerability to physical obstructions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted aerial relays (AR) offer a dynamic and flexible alternative by operating above obstacles and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AR systems in military communications, presenting a detailed comparison between AR and TR paradigms and examining two specific AR technologies: active aerial relays (AAR) and aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) relays. The survey delves into their operation, benefits, challenges, and military applications, supported by a qualitative analysis across metrics such as coverage, flexibility, security, and cost. A novel multi-dimensional metric, the mission-critical relay effectiveness score (MCRES), is introduced as a quantitative method for evaluating relay suitability based on mission-specific weights for critical attributes like mobility, jamming resilience, deployment speed, stealth, coverage, and autonomy. Furthermore, we present Algorithm 1, a decision-making framework that leverages the MCRES to guide the systematic selection of the optimal relay type, AR or TR, and subsequently AAR or ARIS, tailored to the unique demands of a given military scenario, such as dynamic battlefield operations, electronic warfare, or covert missions. Finally, the paper addresses current implementation challenges and outlines promising future research directions to advance the deployment of robust and resilient UAV-mounted relay systems in contested military environments.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolded Fractional Optimization for Maximizing Robust Throughput in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless communication networks aims to leverage artificial intelligence tools for efficient and robust network optimization. This is especially the case since traditional optimization methods often face high computational complexity, motivating the use of deep learning (DL)-based optimization frameworks. In this context, this paper considers a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving multiple users simultaneously through transmit beamforming in downlink mode. To account for robustness, this work proposes an uncertainty-injected deep unfolded fractional programming (UI-DUFP) framework for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization under imperfect channel conditions. The proposed method unfolds fractional programming (FP) iterations into trainable neural network layers refined by projected gradient descent (PGD) steps, while robustness is introduced by injecting sampled channel uncertainties during training and optimizing a quantile-based objective. Simulation results show that the proposed UI-DUFP achieves higher WSR and improved robustness compared to classical weighted minimum mean square error, FP, and DL baselines, while maintaining low inference time and good scalability. These findings highlight the potential of deep unfolding combined with uncertainty-aware training as a powerful approach for robust optimization in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Short-Packet Communication via Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework for analyzing UAV-enabled short-packet communication, leveraging fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted relaying networks. Operating in the short-packet regime and focusing on challenging urban environments, we derive novel, closed-form expressions for the block error rate (BLER). This is achieved by modeling the spatially correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading link via a tractable eigenvalue-based approach. A high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is also presented, revealing the system's fundamental diversity order. Building on this analysis, we formulate a novel energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that, unlike idealized models, uniquely incorporates the non-trivial time and energy overheads of FAS port selection. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize key system parameters. Numerical results validate our analysis, demonstrating that while FAS provides substantial power gains, the operational overhead creates a critical trade-off. This trade-off dictates an optimal number of FAS ports and a non-trivial optimal UAV deployment altitude, governed by the balance between blockage and path loss. This work provides key insights for FAS-aided UAV communications.</description>

      <title>Private Sum Computation: Trade-Offs between Communication, Randomness, and Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider multiple users and a fusion center. Each user possesses a sequence of bits and can communicate with the fusion center through a one-way public channel. The fusion center's task is to compute the sum of all the sequences under the privacy requirement that a set of colluding users, along with the fusion center, cannot gain more than a predetermined amount $\delta$ of information, measured through mutual information, about the sequences of other users. Our first contribution is to characterize the minimum amount of necessary communication between the users and the fusion center, as well as the minimum amount of necessary randomness at the users. Our second contribution is to establish a connection between private sum computation and secret sharing by showing that secret sharing is necessary to generate the local randomness needed for private sum computation, and prove that it holds true for any $\delta \geq 0$.</description>

      <title>AI-Limited Fluid Antenna-Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the fundamental limits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) when the transmitter is subject to an artificial intelligence (AI) representation bottleneck and the receiver employs a fluid antenna system (FAS). Specifically, the message is first encoded into an ideal Gaussian waveform and mapped by an AI encoder into a finite-capacity latent representation that constitutes the physical channel input, while the FAS receiver selects the port experiencing the most favorable channel conditions. We reveal that the AI bottleneck is equivalent to an additive representation noise, which reduces both the communication and sensing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the selected port. We then derive the resulting ISAC capacitydistortion region and establish tight converse and achievability bounds under general fading models, including Jakes-correlated channels. Leveraging the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) characterization of the Jakes' model, we furthermore prove that the port-selection gain is fundamentally constrained by the physical length of the FAS region: the effective diversity order equals the numerical rank of the Jakes' correlation matrix and increases only with the FAS length. Consequently, enlarging the FAS length allows the selected-port SNR to approach the AI-imposed ceiling, driving the achievable communication rate and sensing mean square error (MSE) toward their AI-limited fundamental bounds. Numerical results corroborate the analysis and scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Self-dual Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) self-dual codes are of significant theoretical and practical importance. Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are the most prominent MDS codes. Correspondingly there have been many research on constructions of Euclidean self-dual MDS codes by using GRS codes. However, the study on Hermitian self-dual GRS codes is relatively limited. Since Hermitian self-dual GRS codes do not exist for $n&gt;q+1$, this paper is devoted to an investigation of GRS codes in the case where $n\le q+1$. First, we prove that when $n\leq q+1$, there are only two classes of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes, confirming the conjecture in [13] and providing its proof simultaneously. Second, we present two explicit construction methods. Thus, the existence and construction of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes are fully solved.</description>

      <title>Joint Lossy Compression for a Vector Gaussian Source under Individual Distortion Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the joint compression problem of a vector Gaussian source, where an individual distortion constraint is imposed on each source component. It is known that the rate-distortion function (RDF) is lower-bounded by the rate derived from the Hadamard inequality, which becomes exact when the semidefinite condition (SDC) holds. However, existing works often overlook the case where the SDC is not satisfied. Moreover, even when the SDC holds, a quantitative characterization of how correlations enable more efficient compression is lacking. In this work, we refine the results when the SDC is satisfied and derive new theoretical results when the SDC is not satisfied, thereby establishing theoretical limits for practical source compression with correlations. Specifically, we examine the properties of optimal source reconstruction and provide upper bounds on its dimension, showing that lower-dimensional reconstructions are essential for efficient compression when the SDC does not hold. Within a scalable two-type correlation (2TC) covariance framework, we prove that the probability of satisfying the SDC decays exponentially with source length, emphasizing the importance of exploring theoretical limits when the SDC is not met. Additional, we determine the component-wise correlations that a vector source should possess to achieve the Hadamard compression rate, revealing the trade-off between distortion constraints and correlations. More importantly, by deriving an explicit RDF with correlations incorporated, we quantitatively characterize the gain in compression efficiency achieved by fully leveraging source correlations.</description>

      <title>Codes for Metastability-Containing Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental task of addition under uncertainty, namely, addends that are represented as intervals of numbers rather than single values. One potential source of such uncertainty can occur when obtaining discrete-valued measurements of analog values, which are prone to metastability. Naturally, unstable bits impact gate-level and, consequently, circuit-level computations. Using Binary encoding for such an addition produces a sum with an amplified imprecision. Hence, the challenge is to devise an encoding that does not amplify the imprecision caused by unstable bits. We call such codes recoverable. While this challenge is easily met for unary encoding, no suitable codes of high rates are known. In this work, we prove an upper bound on the rate of preserving and recoverable codes for a given bound on the addends' combined uncertainty. We then design an asymptotically optimal code that preserves the addends' combined uncertainty. We then discuss how to obtain adders for our code. The approach can be used with any known or future construction for containing metastability of the inputs. We conjecture that careful design based on existing techniques can lead to significant latency reduction.</description>

      <title>FDD CSI Feedback under Finite Downlink Training: A Rate-Distortion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of channel state information (CSI) feedback in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) multi-antenna orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under finite-length training with Gaussian pilots. The user employs minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation followed by asymptotically optimal uplink feedback. Specifically, we derive a general rate-distortion function (RDF) of the overall CSI feedback system. We then provide both non-asymptotic bounds and asymptotic scaling for the RDF under arbitrary downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of training symbols exceeds the antenna dimension. A key observation is that, with sufficient training, the overall RDF converges to the direct RDF corresponding to the case where the user has full access to the downlink CSI. More importantly, we demonstrate that even at a fixed downlink SNR, the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the training length. The simulation results show that our bounds are tight, and under very limited training, the deviation between the overall RDF and the direct RDF is substantial.</description>

      <title>Type-Based Unsourced Federated Learning With Client Self-Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the client-selection problem in federated learning over wireless networks under data heterogeneity. Existing client-selection methods often rely on server-side knowledge of client-specific information, thus compromising privacy. To overcome this issue, we propose a client self-selection strategy based solely on the comparison between locally computed training losses and a centrally updated selection threshold. Furthermore, to support robust aggregation of clients' updates over wireless channels, we integrate this client self-selection strategy into the recently proposed type-based unsourced multiple-access framework over distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) networks. The resulting scheme is completely unsourced: the server does not need to know the identity of the clients. Moreover, no channel state information is required, neither at the clients nor at the server side. Simulation results conducted over a D-MIMO wireless network show that the proposed self-selection strategy matches the performance of a comparable state-of-the-art server-side selection method and consistently outperforms random client selection.</description>

      <title>FaA-CAF: Modular Single-RF-Chain Near-Field mmWave Sensing via Clip-On Antenna Fabric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near field mmWave sensing is poised to play a key role in future wireless systems, enabling environment-aware, embodied, and application adaptive operation under stringent form-factor and hardware constraints. However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>The Preservation Tradeoff: A Thermodynamic Bound in the Diminishing-Returns Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic systems that preserve information against thermal fluctuations face a tradeoff distinct from transmission (Shannon) or erasure (Landauer). We establish a feasibility condition for this preservation problem within a broad class of systems exhibiting diminishing returns in error suppression. By defining the preservation stiffness S_kappa, a response function analogous to magnetic susceptibility, we derive an optimality condition linking S_kappa to the resource odds. This identity provides a substrate-agnostic diagnostic: deviations reveal thermodynamic inefficiency or operation outside the smooth reliability regime. For systems in the diminishing-returns regime -- a class we argue is typical of physically realistic error-correction -- the optimal maintenance allocation is bounded above by 50%; for the physically significant subclass exhibiting smooth saturation, it is further constrained to a 30-50% band. We derive this regime from two independent physical principles -- Shannon's channel capacity and Landauer's erasure bound -- whose convergence on the same functional form constitutes our central theoretical contribution. We validate this framework against kinetic proofreading data in E. coli and protocol overhead in TCP/IP networks, and specify conditions under which the prediction is falsifiable.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent-Driven Cognitive Secure Communications in Satellite-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs) have emerged as a promising architecture for providing seamless wireless coverage and connectivity for multiple users. However, potential malicious eavesdroppers pose a serious threat to the private information via STNs due to their non-cooperative behavior and ability to launch intelligent attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a cognitive secure communication framework driven by multiple agents that coordinates spectrum scheduling and protection through real-time sensing, thereby disrupting the judgment of eavesdroppers while preserving reliable data transmission. On this basis, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the secrecy probability of legitimate users, subject to a reliable transmission probability threshold. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-layer coordinated defense system. First, we develop a foundation layer based on multi-agent coordination schedule to determine the satellite operation matrix and the frequency slot occupation matrices, aiming to mitigate spectrum congestion and enhance transmission reliability. Then, we exploit generative adversarial networks to produce adversarial matrices, and employ learning-aided power control to set real and adversarial signal powers for protection layer, which actively degrades the inference capability of eavesdroppers.

      <title>Hybrid-Field Joint Channel and Visible Region Estimation for RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, the large-scale RIS introduces pronounced geometric effects that lead to the coexistence of far-field and near-field propagation. Furthermore, random blockages induce spatial non-stationarity across the RIS array, causing signals from different scatterers to illuminate only partial regions, referred to as visible regions (VRs). This renders conventional far-field and fully visible array-based channel models inadequate and makes channel estimation particularly challenging. In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary cascaded channel estimation problem in a hybrid-field propagation environment, where the RIS-base station (BS) link operates in the far-field, while the user-RIS link exhibits near-field characteristics with partial visibility. To address the resulting high-dimensional and coupled estimation problem, a reduced-dimensional sparse bilinear representation is developed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the cascaded channel. In particular, a dictionary compression technique is proposed to represent the high-dimensional coupled dictionary using a low-dimensional polar-domain dictionary weighted by a visibility matrix, thereby significantly reducing the problem scale. Based on this representation, a turbo-structured joint Bayesian estimation (TS-JBE) approach is proposed to simultaneously estimate the channel gains, VRs, and off-grid parameters, thereby avoiding error propagation inherent in existing sequential methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the estimation accuracy compared with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Envy-Free Allocation of Indivisible Goods via Noisy Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods (items) in which the agents' valuations cannot be observed directly, but instead can only be accessed via noisy queries. In the two-agent setting with Gaussian noise and bounded valuations, we derive upper and lower bounds on the required number of queries for finding an envy-free allocation in terms of the number of items, $m$, and the negative-envy of the optimal allocation, $\Delta$. In particular, when $\Delta$ is not too small (namely, $\Delta \gg m^{1/4}$), we establish that the optimal number of queries scales as $\frac{\sqrt m }{(\Delta / m)^2} = \frac{m^{2.5}}{\Delta^2}$ up to logarithmic factors. Our upper bound is based on non-adaptive queries and a simple thresholding-based allocation algorithm that runs in polynomial time, while our lower bound holds even under adaptive queries and arbitrary computation time.</description>

      <title>Supercharging Simulation-Based Inference for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Science-Informed Design of Deep Learning With Applications to Wireless Systems: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in computational infrastructure and large-scale data processing have accelerated the adoption of data-driven inference methods, particularly deep learning (DL), to solve problems in many scientific and engineering domains. In wireless systems, DL has been applied to problems where analytical modeling or optimization is difficult to formulate, relies on oversimplified assumptions, or becomes computationally intractable. However, conventional DL models are often regarded as non-transparent, as their internal reasoning mechanisms are difficult to interpret even when model parameters are fully accessible. This lack of transparency undermines trust and leads to three interrelated challenges: limited interpretability, weak generalization, and the absence of a principled framework for parameter tuning. Science-informed deep learning (ScIDL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these limitations by integrating scientific knowledge into deep learning pipelines. This integration enables more precise characterization of model behavior and provides clearer explanations of how and why DL models succeed or fail. Despite growing interest, the existing literature remains fragmented and lacks a unifying taxonomy. This tutorial presents a structured overview of ScIDL methods and their applications in wireless systems. We introduce a structured taxonomy that organizes the ScIDL landscape, present two representative case studies illustrating its use in challenging wireless problems, and discuss key challenges and open research directions. The pedagogical structure guides readers from foundational concepts to advanced applications, making the tutorial accessible to researchers in wireless communications without requiring prior expertise in AI.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model Driven Massive Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive random access is an important technology for achieving ultra-massive connectivity in next-generation wireless communication systems. It aims to address key challenges during the initial access phase, including active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD). This paper examines massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where deep learning is used to tackle the challenging AUD, CE, and DD functions. First, we introduce a Transformer-AUD scheme tailored for variable pilot-length access. This approach integrates pilot length information and a spatial correlation module into a Transformer-based detector, enabling a single model to generalize across various pilot lengths and antenna numbers. Next, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-driven iterative CE and DD framework. The GDM employs a score function to capture the posterior distributions of massive MIMO channels and data symbols. Part of the score function is learned from the channel dataset via neural networks, while the remaining score component is derived in a closed form by applying the symbol prior constellation distribution and known transmission model. Utilizing these posterior scores, we design an asynchronous alternating CE and DD framework that employs a predictor-corrector sampling technique to iteratively generate channel estimation and data detection results during the reverse diffusion process. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline methods with respect to AUD, CE, and DD.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing R{\'e}nyi entropy of order $2$ (equivalently, minimizing the index of coincidence) over the set of joint distributions with prescribed marginals. A closed-form optimizer is known under a feasibility condition on the marginals; we show that this condition is highly restrictive. We then provide an explicit construction of an optimal coupling for arbitrary marginals. Our approach characterizes the optimizer's structure and yields an iterative algorithm that terminates in finite time, returning an exact solution after at most $p-1$ updates, where $p$ is the number of rows.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for heralded exact one-way key distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heralded exact one-way distillable secret key is equal to the largest expected rate at which perfect secret key bits can be probabilistically distilled from a bipartite state by means of local operations and one-way classical communication. Here we define the set of super two-extendible states and prove that an arbitrary state in this set cannot be used for heralded exact one-way secret-key distillation. This broad class of states includes both erased states and all full-rank states. Comparing the heralded exact one-way distillable secret key with the more commonly studied approximate one-way distillable secret key, our results demonstrate an extreme gap between them for many states of interest, with the approximate one-way distillable secret key being much larger. Our findings naturally extend to heralded exact one-way entanglement distillation, with similar conclusions.</description>

Abstract: We identify a period-4 measurement schedule for the checks of the Bacon-Shor code that fully covers spacetime with constant-weight detectors, and is numerically observed to provide the code with a threshold. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not rely on code concatenation and instead arises as the solution to a coloring game on a square grid. Under a uniform circuit-level noise model, we observe a threshold of approximately $0.3\%$ when decoding with minimum weight perfect matching, and we conjecture that this could be improved using a more tailored decoder.</description>

      <title>Learning a distance measure from the information-estimation geometry of data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global distance metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.</description>

      <title>Trust Region Masking for Long-Horizon LLM Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods for Large Language Models optimize a policy $\pi_\theta$ via a surrogate objective computed from samples of a rollout policy $\pi_{\text{roll}}$. However, modern LLM-RL pipelines suffer from unavoidable implementation divergences, such as backend discrepancies, Mixture-of-Experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. These factors cause an off-policy mismatch ($\pi_{\text{roll}} \neq \pi_\theta$), leading to approximation errors between the surrogate and the true objective. We demonstrate that classical trust region bounds on this error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. To address this, we derive two new bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. We further derive an Adaptive bound that strictly generalizes the Pinsker-Marginal bound by combining an importance-ratio decomposition of the error with an adaptive per-position application of Pinsker's inequality on the future trajectory divergence; the minimum over all three bounds is tighter than any individual bound. Crucially, all bounds depend on $D_{\mathrm{KL}}^{\mathrm{tok,max}}$, the maximum token-level KL divergence across the sequence. As a \emph{sequence-level} term, the divergence cannot be controlled by previous token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which masks entire sequences that violate the trust region. TRM enables the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees and demonstrates empirical training stability for long-horizon LLM-RL.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Shuffling Beyond Pure Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shuffling is a powerful way to amplify privacy of a local randomizer in private distributed data analysis, but existing analyses mostly treat the local differential privacy (DP) parameter $\varepsilon_0$ as the only knob and give generic upper bounds that can be loose and do not even characterize how shuffling amplifies privacy for basic mechanisms such as the Gaussian mechanism. We revisit the privacy blanket bound of Balle et al. (the blanket divergence) and develop an asymptotic analysis that applies to a broad class of local randomizers under mild regularity assumptions, without requiring pure local DP. Our key finding is that the leading term of the blanket divergence depends on the local mechanism only through a single scalar parameter $\chi$, which we call the shuffle index. By applying this asymptotic analysis to both upper and lower bounds, we obtain a tight band for $\delta_n$ in the shuffled mechanism's $(\varepsilon_n,\delta_n)$-DP guarantee. Moreover, we derive a simple structural necessary and sufficient condition on the local randomizer under which the blanket-divergence-based upper and lower bounds coincide asymptotically. $k$-RR families with $k\ge3$ satisfy this condition, while for generalized Gaussian mechanisms the condition may not hold but the resulting band remains tight. Finally, we complement the asymptotic theory with an FFT-based algorithm for computing the blanket divergence at finite $n$, which offers rigorously controlled relative error and near-linear running time in $n$, providing a practical numerical analysis for shuffle DP.</description>

      <title>CSRv2: Unlocking Ultra-Sparse Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.</description>
