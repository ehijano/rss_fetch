      <title>On Networks and their Applications: Stability of Gene Regulatory Networks and Gene Function Prediction using Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that nested canalizing functions are the minimum-sensitivity Boolean functions for any activity ratio and we determine the functional form of this boundary which has a nontrivial fractal structure. We further observe that the majority of the gene regulatory functions found in known biological networks (submitted to the Cell Collective database) lie on the line of minimum sensitivity which paradoxically remains largely in the unstable regime. Our results provide a quantitative basis for the argument that an evolutionary preference for nested canalizing functions in gene regulation (e.g., for higher robustness) and for elasticity of gene activity are sufficient for concentration of such systems near the "edge of chaos." The original structure of gene regulatory networks is unknown due to the undiscovered functions of some genes. Most gene function discovery approaches make use of unsupervised clustering or classification methods that discover and exploit patterns in gene expression profiles. However, existing knowledge in the field derives from multiple and diverse sources. Incorporating this know-how for novel gene function prediction can, therefore, be expected to improve such predictions. We here propose a function-specific novel gene discovery tool that uses a semi-supervised autoencoder. Our method is thus able to address the needs of a modern researcher whose expertise is typically confined to a specific functional domain. Lastly, the dynamics of unorthodox learning approaches like biologically plausible learning algorithms are investigated and found to exhibit a general form of Einstein relation.</description>

      <title>Biomarker Selection for Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomarkers enable objective monitoring of a given cell or state in a biological system and are widely used in research, biomanufacturing, and clinical practice. However, identifying appropriate biomarkers that are both robustly measurable and capture a state accurately remains challenging. We present a framework for biomarker identification based upon observability guided sensor selection. Our methods, Dynamic Sensor Selection (DSS) and Structure-Guided Sensor Selection (SGSS), utilize temporal models and experimental data, offering a template for applying observability theory to data from biological systems. Unlike conventional methods that assume well-known, fixed dynamics, DSS adaptively select biomarkers or sensors that maximize observability while accounting for the time-varying nature of biological systems. Additionally, SGSS incorporates structural information and diverse data to identify sensors which are resilient against inaccuracies in our model of the underlying system. We validate our approaches by performing estimation on high dimensional systems derived from temporal gene expression data from partial observations. Our algorithms reliably identify known biomarkers and uncover new ones within our datasets. Additionally, integrating chromosome conformation and gene expression data addresses noise and uncertainty, enhancing the reliability of our biomarker selection approach for the genome.</description>
