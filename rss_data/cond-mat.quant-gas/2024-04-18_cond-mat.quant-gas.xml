      <title>Self-Ordered Supersolid in Spinor Condensates with Cavity-Mediated Spin-Momentum-Mixing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms with cavity-mediated long-range interactions offer a promising platform for investing novel quantum phenomena. Exploiting recent experimental advancements, we propose an experimental scheme to create self-ordered supersolid in spin-$1/2$ condensates confined within an optical cavity. The interplay of cavity and pump fields gives rise to supersolid square and plane wave phases, comprehensively described by the two-component Tavis-Cummings model. We show that the self-ordered supersolid phase exhibits an undamped gapless Goldstone mode over a wide parameter range. This proposal, achievable with current experimental setups utilizing identical laser configurations, is in contrast to the realization of checkerboard supersolidity, which hinges on constructing a $U(1)$ symmetry by utilizing two ${\cal Z}_2$ symmetries with precisely matched atom-cavity coupling in multimode resonators. By employing the superradiant photon-exchange process, we realize for the first time cavity-mediated spin-momentum-mixing interactions between highly correlated spin and momentum modes, analogous to that observed spin-mixing in spin-1 condensates. Our scheme provides a unique platform for realizing spin-momentum squeezing and spatially distributed multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Generalized Aubry-Andre-Harper Models in Optical Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms trapped in optical superlattices provide a simple platform for realizing the seminal Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model. However, the periodic modulations on the nearest-neighbour hoppings have been ignored in this model. In this paper, we find that optical superlattice system actually can be approximately described by a generalized AAH model in the case of $V_1\gg V_2$, with periodic modulations on both on-site energies and nearest-neighbour hoppings, supporting much richer topological properties that are absent in the standard AAH model. Specifically, by calculating Chern numbers and topological edge states, we show that the generalized AAH model possesses multifarious topological phases and topological phase transitions, as compared to the standard AAH model only supporting a single topological phase. Our findings can open up more opportunities for using optical superlattices to study topological and localization physics.</description>

      <title>Topological optical Raman superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases of ultracold atoms recently have been intensively studied both in optical superlattices and Raman lattices. However, the topological features induced by the interplay between such two lattices remain largely unexplored. Here, we present an optical Raman superlattice system that incorporates an optical superlattice and a Raman superlattice. The Raman superlattice presented here supports tunable dimerized spin-orbit couplings and staggered on-site spin flips. We find that such system respects a spin-rotation symmetry and has much richer topological properties. Specifically, we show that various topological phases could emerge in the optical Raman superlattice, such as four different chiral topological insulator phases and two different quantum spin Hall insulator phases, identified by spin winding and spin Chern numbers respectively. We also demonstrate that the spin-dependent topological invariants could be directly measured by quench dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modified mean field ansatz for charged polarons in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic Bose polarons are quantum entities emerging from the interaction between an ion and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), featuring long-ranged interactions that can compete with the gas healing length. This can result in strong interparticle correlations and enhancement of gas density around the ion. One possible approach to describe this complex system with high accuracy relies on numerical treatment such as the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques. Nevertheless, it is computationally very expensive and does not easily allow to study the system dynamics. On the other hand, a mean-field based variational ansatz in the co-moving frame can capture a sizeable change in the gas density. We apply it to the case of regularized ion-atom potential and find that it qualitatively reproduces the full numerical results. In addition, we also study the system of two pinned ions, focusing on their effective interaction induced by the bath. This approach seems to be promising for studying transport and nonequilibrium dynamics of charged (bi)polarons in condensed media.</description>

      <title>Extensive Long-Range Entanglement at Finite Temperatures from a Nonequilibrium Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal equilibrium states of local quantum many-body systems are notorious for their spatially decaying correlations, which place severe restrictions on the types of many-body entanglement structures that may be observed at finite temperatures. These restrictions may however be defied when an out-of-equilibrium steady state is considered instead. In this paper, we study the entanglement properties of free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice that contains a generic charge- and energy-conserving noninteracting impurity, and that is connected at its edges to two reservoirs with different equilibrium energy distributions. These distributions may differ in either temperature, chemical potential, or both, thereby inducing an external bias. We analytically derive exact asymptotic expressions for several quantum information measures -- the mutual information, its R\'enyi generalizations, and the fermionic negativity -- that quantify the correlation and entanglement between two subsystems located on opposite sides of the impurity. We show that all these measures scale (to a leading order) linearly with the overlap between one subsystem and the mirror image of the other (upon reflection of the latter about the impurity), independently of the distance between the subsystems. While a simple proportionality relation between the negativity and R\'enyi versions of the mutual information is observed to hold at zero temperature, it breaks down at finite temperatures, suggesting that these quantities represent strong long-range correlations of different origins. Our results generalize previous findings that were limited to the case of a chemical-potential bias at zero temperature, rigorously demonstrating that the effect of long-range volume-law entanglement is robust at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints for the insulating phases of the one-dimensional SU($N$) Kondo lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the insulating phases of the SU($N$)-generalization of the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model is investigated by means of non-perturbative approaches. By extending the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) argument to multi-component fermion systems with translation and global SU($N$) symmetries, we derive two indices which depend on the filling and the ``SU($N$)-spin'' (representation) of the local moments. These indices strongly constrain possible insulating phases; for instance, when the local moments transform in the $N$-dimensional (defining) representation of SU($N$), a featureless Kondo insulator is possible only at filling $f= 1-1/N$. To obtain further insight into the insulating phases suggested by the LSM argument, we derive low-energy effective theories by adding an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange interaction among the local moments [the SU($N$) Kondo-Heisenberg model]. A conjectured global phase diagram of the SU($N$) Kondo lattice model as a function of the filling and the Kondo coupling is then obtained by a combination of different analytical approaches.</description>

      <title>Localized dopant motion across the 2D Ising phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I investigate the motion of a single hole in 2D spin lattices with square and triangular geometries. While the spins have nearest neighbor Ising spin couplings $J$, the hole is allowed to move only in 1D along a single line in the 2D lattice with nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $t$. The non-equilibrium hole dynamics is initialized by suddenly removing a single spin from the thermal Ising spin lattice. I find that for any nonzero spin coupling and temperature, the hole is localized. This is an extension of the thermally induced localization phenomenon [arXiv:2310.11193] to the case, where there is a phase transition to a long-range ordered ferromagnetic phase. The dynamics depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the spin coupling, $k_BT / |J|$, and on the ratio of the spin coupling to the hopping $J/t$. I characterize these dependencies in great detail. In particular, I find universal behavior at high temperatures, common features for the square and triangular lattices across the Curie temperatures for ferromagnetic interactions, and highly distinct behaviors for the two geometries in the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions due geometric frustration in the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Three-body contact for fermions. I. General relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the resonant Fermi gas, that is, two-component fermions in three dimensions interacting by a short-range potential of large scattering length. We introduce a quantity, the three-body contact, that determines several observables. Within the zero-range model, the number of nearby fermion triplets, the large-momentum tail of the center-of-mass momentum distribution of nearby fermion pairs, as well as the large-momentum tail of the two-particle momentum distribution, are expressed in terms of the three-body contact. For a small finite interaction range, the formation rate of deeply bound dimers by three-body recombination, as well as the three-body contribution to the finite-range correction to the energy, are expressed in terms of the three-body contact and of a three-body parameter. This three-body parameter, which vanishes in the zero-range limit, is defined through the asymptotic behavior of the zero-energy scattering state at distances intermediate between the range and the two-body scattering length. In general, the three-body contact has different contributions labeled by spin and angular momentum indices, and the three-body parameter can depend on those indices. We also include the generalization to unequal masses for $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ particles. With respect to the relation between three-body loss rate and number of nearby triplets stated in [Petrov, Salomon and Shlyapnikov, PRL 93, 090404 (2004)], the present work adds a derivation, expresses the proportionality factor in terms of the three-body parameter, and includes the general case where there are several contributions to the three-body contact and several three-body parameters.</description>

      <title>Bogoliubov excitations driven by thermal lattice phonons in a quantum fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elementary excitations in weakly interacting quantum fluids have a non-trivial nature which is at the basis of defining quantum phenomena such as superfluidity. These excitations and the physics they lead to have been explored in closed quantum systems at thermal equilibrium both theoretically within the celebrated Bogoliubov framework, and experimentally in quantum fluids of ultracold atoms. Over the past decade, the relevance of Bogoliubov excitations has become essential to understand quantum fluids of interacting photons. Their driven-dissipative character leads to distinct properties with respect to their equilibrium counterparts. For instance, the condensate coupling to the photonic vacuum environment leads to a non-zero generation rate of elementary excitations with many striking implications. In this work, considering that quantum fluids of light are often hosted in solid-state systems, we show within a joint theory-experiment analysis that the vibrations of the crystal constitute another environment that the condensate is fundamentally coupled to. This coupling leads to a unique heat transfer mechanism, resulting in a large generation rate of elementary excitations in typical experimental conditions, and to a fundamental non-zero contribution at vanishing temperatures. Our work provides a complete framework for solid-embedded quantum fluids of light, which is invaluable in view of achieving a regime dominated by photon vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum phase transition on the kagome lattice: Distinct velocities of spinon and string excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum phase transition (DQPT) provides an extraordinary possibility of the quantum phase transition beyond the Ginzburg-Landau paradigm, which is interwoven with numerous exotic phenomena of the strongly correlated quantum many-body system, e.g. fractional excitation, emergent symmetries, and gauge field. However, various candidates of DQPT have been demonstrated to be weakly first-order, and the conformal field theory (CFT) has to be altered into a non-unitary one. Here we numerically found two linear dispersions with different velocities in one of the few survivors of DQPT -- the extended hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on the Kagome lattice. Such counterintuitive results directly lead to the negation of possible emergent Lorentz symmetry, and the breakdown of conventional theory of DQPT. Furthermore, the snapshots of boson configuration hint that these two velocities may correspond to the dynamics of the fractional excitations and quantum strings, respectively. Our work will inspire the revisit of the theory of DQPT and benefit the field of quantum materials and quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: For a translation invariant system of $N$ bosons in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, we establish a precise bound for the ground state energy $E_N$. While the leading, order $N$, contribution to $E_N$ has been known since [30,28] and the second order corrections (of order one) have been first determined in [5], our estimate also resolves the next term in the asymptotic expansion of $E_N$, which is of the order $(\log N) / N$.</description>

      <title>Structural complexity of snapshots of 2D Fermi-Hubbard systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum gas microscopy for two-dimensional optical lattices has provided an unparalleled tool to study the Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) with ultracold atoms. Spin-resolved projective measurements, or snapshots, have played a significant role in quantifying correlation functions which uncover underlying physical phenomena such as antiferromagnetism at commensurate filling on bipartite lattices, and other charge and spin correlations, as well as dynamical properties at various densities. However, in order to interpret these results and to establish temperature scales, comparison against theory is generally needed. Here, we employ a recent concept, the {\em multi-scale structural complexity}, and show that when computed for the snapshots (of either single spin species, local moments, or total density) it can provide a theory-free property, immediately accessible to experiments. Specifically, after benchmarking results for Ising and XY models, we study the structural complexity of snapshots of the repulsive FHM in the two-dimensional square lattice as a function of doping and temperature. We generate projective measurements using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and compare their complexities against those from the experiment. We demonstrate that these complexities are linked to relevant physical observables such as the entropy and double occupancy. Their behaviors capture the development of correlations and relevant length scales in the system. We provide an open-source code in Python which can be implemented into data analysis routines in experimental settings for the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Theory of parametric resonance for discrete time crystals in fully-connected spin-cavity systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pinpoint the conditions necessary for discrete time crystal (DTC) formation in fully connected spin-cavity systems from the perspective of parametric resonance by mapping these systems onto oscillator like models. We elucidate the role of nonlinearity and dissipation by mapping the periodically driven open Dicke model onto effective linear and nonlinear oscillator models, while we analyze the effect of global symmetry breaking using the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model with tunable anisotropy. We show that the system's nonlinearity restrains the dynamics from becoming unbounded when driven resonantly. On the other hand, dissipation keeps the oscillation amplitude of the period-doubling instability fixed, which is a key feature of DTCs. The presence of global symmetry breaking in the absence of driving is found to be crucial in the parametric resonant activation of period-doubling response. We provide analytic predictions for the resonant frequencies and amplitudes leading to DTC formation for both systems using their respective oscillator models.</description>
