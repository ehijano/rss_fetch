      <title>Free Energy Calculations using Smooth Basin Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of atomic simulations of materials and molecules can rapidly deteriorate when large free energy barriers exist between local minima. We propose smooth basin classification, a universal method to define reaction coordinates based on the internal feature representation of a graph neural network. We achieve high data efficiency by exploiting their built-in symmetry and adopting a transfer learning strategy. We benchmark our approach on challenging chemical and physical transformations, and show that it matches and even outperforms reaction coordinates defined based on human intuition.</description>

      <title>Photochemistry upon charge separation in triphenylamine derivatives from fs to $\mathrm{\mu}$s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemical methods and time-resolved laser spectroscopy are employed to elucidate ultrafast charge separation processes in triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives upon photoexcitation. When changing the ambient solvent from generic ones to those capable of accepting electrons, such as chloroform, a vastly extended and multifaceted photochemistry is observed. Following the initial excitation, two concurrent charge transfer processes are identified. Firstly, when the TPA derivative and solvent molecules are correctly positioned, an electron transfer to the solvent molecule with immediate charge separation takes place. Consequently, this process gives rise to the formation of the corresponding radical cation of the TPA derivative. This highly reactive species can subsequently combine with other TPA derivative molecules to yield dimeric species. Secondly, when the molecular positioning upon photoexcitation is not optimal, relaxation back to the $\mathrm{S_1}$ state occurs. From this state, an electron transfer process leads to the formation of a charge transfer complex. In this complex, the negatively charged solvent molecule remains closely associated with the positively charged TPA derivative. Within 30 picoseconds, the charges within this complex recombine, yielding a triplet state. This transition to the triplet state is driven by a lower reaction barrier for charge separation compared to the formation of the singlet state.</description>

      <title>Twins in rotational spectroscopy: Does a rotational spectrum uniquely identify a molecule?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational spectroscopy is the most accurate method for determining structures of molecules in the gas phase. It is often assumed that a rotational spectrum is a unique "fingerprint" of a molecule. The availability of large molecular databases and the development of artificial intelligence methods for spectroscopy makes the testing of this assumption timely. In this paper, we pose the determination of molecular structures from rotational spectra as an inverse problem. Within this framework, we adopt a funnel-based approach to search for molecular twins, which are two or more molecules, which have similar rotational spectra but distinctly different molecular structures. We demonstrate that there are twins within standard levels of computational accuracy by generating rotational constants for many molecules from several large molecular databases, indicating the inverse problem is ill-posed. However, some twins can be distinguished by increasing the accuracy of the theoretical methods or by performing additional experiments.</description>

      <title>Proposal on the Calculation of the Ionisation-Cluster Size Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stochastic model for the calculation of the ionisation-cluster size distribution in nanodosimetry is proposed. It is based on a canonical ensemble and derives from the well-known nuclear droplet model. It is able to describe the ionisation-cluster size distributions caused by electrons. It can easily be extented to light ions. In principle, the model has no free parameters. The model especially can be seen as a refinement to B. Grosswendts model. It is shown that it leads to a cluster-size distribution function F2 being more similar to of the yield of double-strand breaks in the DNA than the one calculated by B. Grosswendt. However, the results are still subject to major uncertainties. The focus of this work is on presenting the model and demonstrating its feasibility.</description>

      <title>Active Causal Learning for Decoding Chemical Complexities with Targeted Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and enhancing inherent properties based on molecular structures is paramount to design tasks in medicine, materials science, and environmental management. Most of the current machine learning and deep learning approaches have become standard for predictions, but they face challenges when applied across different datasets due to reliance on correlations between molecular representation and target properties. These approaches typically depend on large datasets to capture the diversity within the chemical space, facilitating a more accurate approximation, interpolation, or extrapolation of the chemical behavior of molecules. In our research, we introduce an active learning approach that discerns underlying cause-effect relationships through strategic sampling with the use of a graph loss function. This method identifies the smallest subset of the dataset capable of encoding the most information representative of a much larger chemical space. The identified causal relations are then leveraged to conduct systematic interventions, optimizing the design task within a chemical space that the models have not encountered previously. While our implementation focused on the QM9 quantum-chemical dataset for a specific design task-finding molecules with a large dipole moment-our active causal learning approach, driven by intelligent sampling and interventions, holds potential for broader applications in molecular, materials design and discovery.</description>

      <title>Intercavity polariton slows down dynamics in strongly coupled cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Band engineering stands as an efficient route to induce strongly correlated quantum many-body phenomena. Besides inspiring analogies among diverse physical fields, tuning on demand the group velocity is highly attractive in photonics because it allows unconventional flows of light. $\Lambda$-schemes offer a route to control the propagation of light in a lattice-free configurations, enabling exotic phases such as slow-light and allowing for highly optical non-linear systems. Here, we realize room-temperature intercavity Frenkel polaritons excited across two strongly coupled cavities. We demonstrate the formation of a tuneable heavy-polariton, akin to slow light, appearing in the absence of a periodic in-plane potential. Our photonic architecture based on a simple three-level scheme enables the unique spatial segregation of photons and excitons in different cavities and maintains a balanced degree of mixing between them. This unveils a dynamical competition between many-body scattering processes and the underlying polariton nature which leads to an increased fluorescence lifetime. The intercavity polariton features are further revealed under appropriate resonant pumping, where we observe suppression of the polariton fluorescence intensity.</description>

      <title>A novel molecule generative model of VAE combined with Transformer for unseen structure generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, molecule generation using deep learning has been actively investigated in drug discovery. In this field, Transformer and VAE are widely used as powerful models, but they are rarely used in combination due to structural and performance mismatch of them. This study proposes a model that combines these two models through structural and parameter optimization in handling diverse molecules. The proposed model shows comparable performance to existing models in generating molecules, and showed by far superior performance in generating molecules with unseen structures. Another advantage of this VAE model is that it generates molecules from latent representation, and therefore properties of molecules can be easily predicted or conditioned with it, and indeed, we show that the latent representation of the model successfully predicts molecular properties. Ablation study suggested the advantage of VAE over other generative models like language model in generating novel molecules. It also indicated that the latent representation can be shortened to ~32 dimensional variables without loss of reconstruction, suggesting the possibility of a much smaller molecular descriptor or model than existing ones. This study is expected to provide a virtual chemical library containing a wide variety of compounds for virtual screening and to enable efficient screening.</description>
