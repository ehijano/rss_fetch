      <title>Universal crossover in surface superconductivity: Impact of varying Debye energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, interference-induced surface superconductivity (SC) has been predicted within an attractive Hubbard model with $s$-wave pairing, prompting intensive studies of its properties. The most notable finding is that the surface critical temperature $T_{cs}$ can be significantly enhanced relative to the bulk critical temperature $T_{cb}$. In this work, considering a $1D$ attractive Hubbard model for the half-filling level, we investigate how this enhancement is affected by variations in the Debye energy $\hbar\omega_D$, which controls the number of states contributing to the pair potential and, in turn, influences the critical temperature. Our study reveals a universal crossover of the surface SC from the weak- to strong-coupling regime, regardless of the specific value of the Debye energy. The location of this crossover is marked by the maximum of $\tau = (T_{cs} - T_{cb})/T_{cb}$, which depends strongly on $\hbar\omega_D$. At its maximum, $\tau$ can increase up to nearly $70\%$. Additionally, we examine the evolution of the ratio $\Delta_{s0}/k_B T_{cs}$ along the crossover, where $\Delta_{s0}$ is the zero-temperature pair potential near the surface (the chain ends), and demonstrate that this ratio can significantly deviate from $\Delta_{b0}/k_B T_{cb}$, where $\Delta_{b0}$ is the zero-temperature bulk pair potential (in the chain center). Our findings may offer valuable insights into the search for higher critical temperatures in narrow-band superconductors.</description>

      <title>BKT phase transition in nanoporous films of superconducting NbN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in mildly disordered NbN nanoporous (NP) films. The measured superfluid stiffness, Js, is found to be much lower than that predicted by considering the reduction in the geometric area. This effect is also reproduced theoretically via Monte Carlo simulations on a 2D XY model with different nanopore geometries. For a 5 nm thick NP film, a distinct BKT transition is observed. BKT renormalization group flow equations, incorporating the broadening in Js due to the presence of inhomogeneities, are used to fit the experimental data. From this analysis we see that both Js and the vortex core energy, mu, decrease in the presence of nanopores. Our results show that nanopore geometries effectively enhance the 2D nature of the films, thereby increasing the parameter space to explore BKT physics in superconducting films.</description>

      <title>A Design of Josephson Diode Based on Magnetic Impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a mechanism to realize the superconducting diode effect (SDE): The current can generate a magnetic field, affecting the magnetic moment of magnetic impurity. When the connection region of the Josephson junction is coupled with the magnetic impurity, the supercurrents in positive and negative directions have different influences on the magnetic moment. This results in a phenomenon that the critical supercurrents in these opposite directions are unequal, which is called SDE. We model the Josephson connection region by a quantum dot. Then the critical supercurrents are investigated by the non-equilibrium Green's function method, and we carry out a detailed symmetry analysis on the supercurrent relations. The calculation results confirm that the SDE does exist in this system. Besides, the SDE is significant in a wide parameter space and can be effectively adjusted in various ways. Our design only demands a magnetic impurity and conventional superconductors. The unconventional finite-momentum Cooper pair and spin-orbit coupling are not required, and there is also no need for the existence of chirality or an external magnetic field. Our work provides a universal device structure for the development of superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of superconductivity and sliding polar metal state in HgPSe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous presence of polarity and metallicity in a material signifies an exotic polar metal state, but such materials are extremely rare, especially in bulk form, due to mutually exclusive nature of the fundamental defining properties. Here, we report experimental findings that HgPSe3 is a robust bulk polar metal at room temperature with a chiral structure stabilized by pressure and, remarkably, this polar metal hosts superconductivity with critical temperature Tc up to 11 K. Theoretical analysis reveals a two-step interlayer sliding-then-compressing mechanism for coexistence of polarity and metallicity in HgPSe3. This work unveils a new paradigm for creating the bulk polar metal state and simultaneous presence of coexisting quantum orders, raising the prospect of discovering novel emergent physics using pressure as a tuning knob.</description>

      <title>Superconducting junctions with flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of flat-band superconductor junctions that behave differently from ordinary junctions containing only metals with Fermi surfaces. In particular, we show how in the tunneling limit the critical Josephson current between flat-band superconductors is inversely proportional to the pair potential, how the quantum geometric contribution to the supercurrent contributes even in the normal state of a flat-band weak link, and how Andreev reflection is strongly affected by the presence of bound states. Our results are relevant for analyzing the superconducting properties of junctions involving magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene as well as other electronic systems with flat bands.</description>

      <title>Graphene calorimetric single-photon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photon detectors (SPDs) are essential technology in quantum science, quantum network, biology, and advanced imaging. To detect the small quantum of energy carried in a photon, conventional SPDs rely on energy excitation across either a semiconductor bandgap or superconducting gap. While the energy gap suppresses the false-positive error, it also sets an energy scale that can limit the detection efficiency of lower energy photons and spectral bandwidth of the SPD. Here, we demonstrate an orthogonal approach to detect single near-infrared photons using graphene calorimeters. By exploiting the extremely low heat capacity of the pseudo-relativistic electrons in graphene near its charge neutrality point, we observe an electron temperature rise up to ~2 K using a hybrid Josephson junction. In this proof-of-principle experiment, we achieve an intrinsic quantum efficiency of 87% (75%) with dark count &lt; 1 per second (per hour) at operation temperatures as high as 1.2 K. Our results highlight the potential of electron calorimetric SPDs for detecting lower-energy photons from the mid-IR to microwave regimes, opening pathways to study space science in far-infrared regime, to search for dark matter axions, and to advance quantum technologies across a broader electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Dispersion kinks from electronic correlations in an unconventional iron-based superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The attractive interaction in conventional BCS superconductors is provided by a bosonic mode. However, the pairing glue of most unconventional superconductors is unknown. The effect of electron-boson coupling is therefore extensively studied in these materials. A key signature are dispersion kinks that can be observed in the spectral function as abrupt changes in velocity and lifetime of quasiparticles. Here, we show the existence of two kinks in the unconventional iron-based superconductor RbFe$_2$As$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). In addition, we observe the formation of a Hubbard band multiplet due to the combination of Coulomb interaction and Hund's rule coupling in this multiorbital systems. We demonstrate that the two dispersion kinks are a consequence of these strong many-body interactions. This interpretation is in line with a growing number of theoretical predictions for kinks in various general models of correlated materials. Our results provide a unifying link between iron-based superconductors and different classes of correlated, unconventional superconductors such as cuprates and heavy-fermion materials.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of the real-time photon-instanton cross-section in a superconducting circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instantons, semi-classical trajectories of quantum tunneling in imaginary time, have long been used to study thermodynamic and transport properties in a myriad of condensed matter and high energy systems. A recent experiment in superconducting circuits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 197701, (2021)] provided first evidence for direct dynamical signatures of instantons (phase slips), manifested by order-unity inelastic decay probabilities for photons with which they interact, motivating the development of a scattering theory of instantons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 137701, (2021)]. While this framework successfully predicted the measured inelastic decay rates of the photons for several experimental devices, it is valid only if the tunneling time of the instantons is much shorter than the relaxation time of the environment in which they are embedded, and requires a closed analytical expression for the instanton trajectory. Here, we amend these issues by incorporating numerical methods that lift some of the previously applied approximations. Our results agree with the experimental measurements, also for devices with shorter relaxation times, without fitting parameters. This framework should be useful in many other quantum field theoretical contexts.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of Kane-Mele Hubbard model at small doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiment on MoTe$_2$-WTe$_2$ twisted bi-layer demonstrated physics of Kane-Mele (KM) as well as Haldane models. Although topological properties of KM model has been studied extensively, effects of interaction are still less explored beyond half filling. In this work we study the effect of Hubbard interaction in KM model at small hole doping around half filling. We use density matrix renormalization group method to characterize different phase of cylinders with width of $L_y=3$ unit cells. We identify {a possible} superconducting (SC) phase and transition at different strength of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and show the strong dependence of critical interaction for SC transition. We also calculate the single-particle Green's function, spin-spin and density-density correlations and compare with SC correlation to establish the dominance of SC correlations. Our result highlights striking behaviour of SC transition and its dependence on SOC which could be useful in understanding different ways to achieve unconventional SC.</description>

      <title>A superconducting on-chip microwave cavity for tunable hybrid systems with optically trapped Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems are highly promising platforms for addressing important challenges of quantum information science and quantum sensing. Their implementation, however, is technologically non-trivial, since each component typically has unique experimental requirements. Here, we work towards a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting on-chip microwave circuit in a dilution refrigerator and optically trapped ultra-cold atoms. Specifically, we focus on the design optimization of a suitable superconducting chip and on the corresponding challenges and limitations. We unfold detailed microwave-cavity engineering strategies for maximized and tunable coupling rates to atomic Rydberg-Rydberg transitions in $\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ atoms while respecting the boundary conditions due to the presence of a laser beam near the surface of the chip. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of the superconducting microwave chip and discuss the cavity characteristics as a function of temperature and applied dc voltage. Our results illuminate the required consideration aspects for a flexible, tunable superconductor-atom hybrid system, and lay the groundwork for realizing this exciting platform in a dilution refrigerator with vacuum Rabi frequencies approaching the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ) at equilibrium, using exact path integral techniques. Our writing of the effective action makes it clear that the superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ, cannot exist. This can be traced to translational invariances in the Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian making the junction's reduced ground state highly degenerate and actually lacking the symmetry that the transition is supposed to break. For all parameters, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted in part from ill-assuming it would not. Our results fully support and confirm the experimental invalidation of this quantum phase transition by Murani et al. in 2020.</description>

      <title>Voltage-driven dynamics of $\varphi_0$-S/F/S Josephson junctions chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions with anomalous phase shift $\varphi_0$ ($\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs) implement a coupling between the superconducting phase and the spin degrees of freedom. Here we investigate the dynamics of voltage-biased coupled chains of $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs and predict that the presence of $\varphi_0$ makes the conventional regime corresponding to the linear growth of the superconducting phase at each of the junctions and oscillating Josephson current unstable. New stable regimes are found and investigated. The changes of the dynamic behavior are clearly seen in the IV-characteristics of the system and can serve as a fingerprint of the presence of the magnetoelectric coupling $\varphi_0$. Moreover, the collective magnetic excitations of the chains of $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs, which were reported by G.A. Bobkov {\it et. al.} [JETP Lett. {\bf 119}, 251 (2024)] also manifest themselves in the IV-characteristics. This provides a method for their experimental detection and direct measurement of the constant quantifying the strength of the coupling between the superconducting phase and the spin degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: We derived a simple reduced form from the exact solution of the mixed magnetic and quadrupolar nuclear spin--lattice relaxation function at the central transition line of a quadrupole-split NMR spectrum for the nuclear spin $I$ = 3/2. The reduced form of the exact solution could be extended to include inhomogeneous relaxation effects. From the application of the reduced form to the $^{63}$Cu nuclear spin--lattice relaxation curves in the high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductors of $^{63}$Cu-enriched triple-layer HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$, we estimated the predominant magnetic relaxation rate $^{63}W_M$ and the upper limit of a weak nuclear electric quadrupole spin--lattice relaxation rate $^{63}W_Q$.</description>

Abstract: The current-phase relation for a ballistic SNS junction in a 1D wire at T = 0 was derived by Thuneberg [1] neglecting phase gradients in superconducting leads. This invalidates the derivation, since the charge conservation law is violated. The theory of Ref. [1] predicts an unphysical phase jump in the limit of zero normal-layer thickness. In this limit the SNS junction becomes an ideal uniform superconductor, in which the currentis supported by a constant phase gradient without any phase jump.</description>

Abstract: We compute the structure of flux $h/(2e)$ vortices in a d-wave superconductor which emerges from a higher temperature pseudogap metal. Such a transition is described by a continuum theory of the Higgs condensation of 2 flavors of charge $e$ bosons which are fundamentals of an emergent SU(2) gauge field. Period-2 charge order is present near the vortex center. Upon coupling the electrons to the superconducting and charge order parameters, we find that the electronic local density of states does not have a zero-bias peak, in contrast to BCS theory. But there are sub-gap peaks at positive and negative bias, and these exhibit anti-phase periodic spatial modulations, similar to observations in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments in the underdoped cuprates (K. Matsuba et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 063704 (2007)).</description>
