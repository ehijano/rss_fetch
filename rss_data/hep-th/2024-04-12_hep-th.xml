      <title>Gravity-Induced Photon Interactions and Infrared Consistency in any Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the four-photon ($F^4$) operators generated by loops of charged particles of spin $0$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $1$ in the presence of gravity and in any spacetime dimension $d$. To this end, we expand the one-loop effective action via the heat kernel coefficients, which provide both the gravity-induced renormalization of the $F^4$ operators and the low-energy Einstein-Maxwell effective field theory (EFT) produced by massive charged particles. Reduction of the operator basis is achieved using that the Gauss-Bonnet combination vanishes at quadratic order in any dimension. A standard infrared consistency argument applies to four-photon scattering in any dimension $d\geq 3$, setting a positivity bound on the $F^4$ operators. We assume that the graviton $t$-channel pole may be discarded. Surprisingly, the $d=6$ gravity-induced beta functions of $F^4$ operators from charged particles of any spin are positive. This implies that the EFT of massless charged particles is infrared-inconsistent in $d=6$. For massive charged particles in $d$ dimensions, infrared consistency implies a variety of bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio, under the condition that the Planckian $F^4$ operators are sufficiently small or negative. These bounds imply a version of the $d$-dimensional Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in most but not all dimensions. In the special case of $d=6$, the WGC-like bounds are logarithmically enhanced.</description>

      <title>Liouville gravity at the end of the world: Deformed defects in AdS/BCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study shape deformations of two-dimensional end-of-the-world (ETW) branes, such as those in bottom-up models of two-dimensional holographic boundary conformal field theories (BCFT), and derive an action for the theory of brane deformations in any bulk three-dimensional maximally symmetric spacetime. In the case of a bulk anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, at leading order in the ultraviolet cutoff, the induced theory on the brane controlling its shape is Liouville gravity coupled to quantum matter. We show in certain limits the theory reduces to semi-classical AdS, dS or flat Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, thus providing the first doubly-holographic derivation of two-dimensional models of dilaton gravity minimally coupled to a large number of conformal fields. Specializing to the AdS JT gravity limit, we discuss the dual BCFT interpretation and provide evidence that changing the boundary conditions of JT gravity on the brane is equivalent to a deformation of the dual BCFT with the displacement operator. This establishes a doubly-holographic triality between (i) brane deformations in the bulk, (ii) JT gravity in the brane description, and (iii) irrelevant deformations of the CFT boundary. Lastly, in the presence of a non-trivial dilaton profile, we prove that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for holographic BCFTs receives a contact term whenever the minimal surface ends on the brane.</description>

      <title>Planar RG Flows on Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of renormalization group flows on line defects that can be described by a generalized free field with ordered planar contractions on the line. They are realized, for example, in large $N$ gauge theories with matter in the fundamental representation and arise generically in non-relativistic CFTs. We analyze the flow exactly and compute the change in the $g$-function between the UV and IR fixed points. We relate the result to the change in the two-point function of the displacement operator and check the monotonicity of the defect entropy along the flow analytically. Finally, we give a general realization of this type of flow starting from the direct sum of the IR fixed point and a trivial line. This type of defect renormalization group flow parallels the well-studied case of double-trace flow.</description>

      <title>Unravelling AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ near the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlation functions of spectrally-flowed vertex operators in bosonic string theory on $\text{AdS}_3\times X$ in the path integral formalism. By restricting the path integral to only include worldsheets which live near the asymptotic boundary, we compute correlation functions of spectrally-flowed vertex operators and find a precise agreement with the perturbative correlators in the recently-proposed dual CFT at all orders in conformal perturbation theory. We thus provide highly nontrivial evidence for the bulk/boundary duality.</description>

      <title>Peierls Transition in Gross-Neveu Model from Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Gross-Neveu model is anticipated to undergo a crystalline phase transition at high baryon charge densities. This conclusion is drawn from the mean-field approximation, which closely resembles models of Peierls instability. We demonstrate that this transition indeed occurs when both the rank of the symmetry group and the dimension of the particle representation contributing to the baryon density are large (the large-N limit). We derive this result through the exact solution of the model, developing the large-N limit of the Bethe Ansatz. Our analytical construction of the large-N solution of the Bethe Ansatz equations aligns perfectly with the periodic (finite-gap) solution of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) of the mean-field analysis.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature renormalization of Standard Model coupled with gravity, and its implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metrics, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. Notably, this method also provides an effective tool for addressing one of the longstanding problems in QCD, the Linde problem. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Three-loop renormalization of the quantum action for a five-dimensional scalar cubic model with the usage of the background field method and a cutoff regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies the quantum action for the five-dimensional real $\phi^3$-theory in the case of a general formulation using the background field method. The three-loop renormalization is performed with the usage of a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation. The explicit form of the first three coefficients for the renormalization constants is presented. The absence of non-local singular contributions and partial results for the fourth correction are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we embark on the thermodynamic investigation concerning a family of primary charged black holes within the context of shift and parity symmetric Beyond Horndeski gravity. Employing the Euclidean approach, we derive the functional expression for the free energy and derive the first thermodynamic law, offering a methodology to address the challenge of extracting the thermal quantities in shift-symmetric scalar tensor theories characterized by linear time dependence in the scalar field. Following the formal analysis, we provide some illustrative examples focusing on the thermal evaporation of these fascinating objects.</description>

      <title>Wiener-Hopf solution of the free energy TBA problem and instanton sectors in the O(3) sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbation theory in asymptotically free quantum field theories is asymptotic. The factorially growing perturbative coefficients carry information about non-perturbative corrections, which can be related to renormalons and instantons. Using the Wiener-Hopf technique we determine the full analytic solution for the free energy density in the two dimensional $O(N)$ sigma models. For $N&gt;3$ there are no instantons, and we found that the perturbative series carries all the information about the non-perturbative corrections. However, in the $O(3)$ case, we identify several non-perturbative sectors that are not related to the asymptotics of the perturbative series. The number of sectors depends on the observables: for the ground-state energy density we identify three sectors, which we attribute to instantons. For the free energy density in the running perturbative coupling we found infinitely many sectors.</description>

      <title>Chromoelectric flux tubes within non-Abelian Proca theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux tube solutions within non-Abelian SU(3) Proca theory with external sources are obtained. It is shown that such tubes have a longitudinal chromoelectric field possessing two components (nonlinear and gradient), as well as a transverse chromomagnetic field whose force lines create concentric circles with the center on the axis of the tube. The scenario of a possible relationship between non-Abelian Proca theory and quantum chromodynamics is considered. In such scenario: (a)~the components of color fields have different behavior: those which are almost classical, and those which are purely quantum; (b)~the second components create a gluon condensate that is a source of the field for the almost classical components of the Proca field; (c)~Proca masses may appear as a result of an approximate description of the gluon condensate. It is shown that the results obtained are in good agreement with the results of lattice calculations. We make an assumption that an approximate description of a flux tube in quantum chromodynamics can be carried out using classical Proca equations but with a mandatory account of a gluon condensate.</description>

      <title>Emergent factorization of Hilbert space at large $N$ and black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent factorization of Hilbert space in the low-energy description of matrix models, addressing key aspects of the black hole information paradox. We examine the collective description for the low-energy sector of $SU(N)$ matrix model, characterized by a factorized Hilbert space composed of a finite number of boxes and anti-boxes. This factorization leads us to examine the emergence of thermofield dynamics (TFD) state in the low energy sector from a fine-tuned state. In addition, we study the collective Hamiltonian of the $U(N)$ matrix model for the semi-classical description of "particle-hole" fluctuations around a background Young tableau. Our investigation of these matrix models elucidates a concrete mechanism for constructing the truncated algebra of accessible observables, thereby facilitating an understanding of black hole complementarity. In the context of the black hole information paradox, we discuss the origin of the island appearing inside the black hole and provide a reinterpretation of the recent proposal -- the holography of information.</description>

      <title>New horizons for inhomogeneous quenches and Floquet CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fruitful avenue in investigating out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems is to abruptly change their Hamiltonian and study the subsequent evolution of their quantum state. If this is done once, the setup is called a quench, while if it is done periodically, it is called Floquet driving. We consider the solvable setup of a two-dimensional CFT driven by Hamiltonians built out of conformal symmetry generators: in this case, the quantum dynamics can be understood using two-dimensional geometry. We investigate how the dynamics is reflected in the holographic dual three-dimensional spacetime and find new horizons. We argue that bulk operators behind the new horizons are reconstructable by virtue of modular flow.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quantum gravity denounces singular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although General Relativity predicts the presence of a singularity inside of a Black Hole, it is not a complete theory of gravity. A real structure of a Black Hole interior near an expected singularity depends on the UV completion of gravity. In this paper, we establish that the question whether singular spherically symmetric solutions are absent is governed by the functional form of a non-perturbative graviton propagator. We explicitly show in a framework of a ghost-free infinite derivative gravity that for the graviton propagator of an exponential form favored by the unitarity a singularity is not possible unless an unphysical situation when the total mass of the Black Hole is infinite is considered.</description>

      <title>ISCOs and the weak gravity conjecture bound in Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study circular orbits of charged particles in spherically symmetric AdS black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity in arbitrary dimensions, and their limiting ISCOs (innermost stable circular orbits). The dual interpretation is in terms of certain conformal field theory (CFT) operators, whose anomalous dimensions can be extracted from the binding energy of charged probes in the bulk, in a large radius limit. The charge to mass ratio of particles in the black hole background is found to increase with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\widetilde{\alpha}$, consistent with the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) bound known for self-repulsive particles. The radius of the ISCOs decreases with $\widetilde{\alpha}$, existing until the limit set by the WGC bound.</description>

      <title>Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive CMB data analysis of cosmological collider physics. New heavy particles during inflation can leave imprints in the primordial correlators which are observable in today's cosmological surveys. This remarkable detection channel provides an unsurpassed opportunity to probe new physics at extremely high energies. Here we initiate the search for these relic signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck legacy release. On the theory side, guided by recent progress from the cosmological bootstrap, we first propose a family of analytic bispectrum templates that incorporate the distinctive signatures of cosmological collider physics. Our consideration includes the oscillatory signals in the squeezed limit, the angular dependence from spinning fields, and several new shapes from nontrivial sound speed effects. On the observational side, we apply the recently developed pipeline, CMB Bispectrum Estimator (CMB-BEST), to efficiently analyze the three-point statistics and search directly for these new templates in the Planck 2018 temperature and polarization data. We report stringent CMB constraints on these new templates. Furthermore, we perform parameter scans to search for the best-fit values with maximum significance. For a benchmark example of collider templates, we find $f_{NL}=-91\pm40$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the biggest adjusted significance we get is $1.8\sigma$. In general, we find no significant evidence of cosmological collider signals in the Planck data. However, this innovative analysis demonstrates the potential for discovering new heavy particles during inflation in forthcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>PolyBin3D: A Suite of Optimal and Efficient Power Spectrum and Bispectrum Estimators for Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By measuring, modeling and interpreting cosmological datasets, one can place strong constraints on models of the Universe. Central to this effort are summary statistics such as power spectra and bispectra, which condense the high-dimensional dataset into low-dimensional representations. In this work, we introduce a modern set of estimators for computing such statistics from three-dimensional clustering data, and provide a flexible Python implementation; PolyBin3D. Working in a maximum-likelihood formalism, we derive general estimators for the two- and three-point functions, which yield unbiased spectra regardless of the survey mask, weighting scheme, and presence of holes in the window function. These can be directly compared to theory without the need for mask-convolution. Furthermore, we present a numerical scheme for computing the optimal (minimum-variance) estimators for a given survey, which is shown to reduce error-bars on large-scales. Our Python package includes both general "unwindowed'' estimators and idealized equivalents (appropriate for simulations), each of which are efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms and Monte Carlo summation tricks, and additionally supports GPU acceleration. These are extensively validated in this work, with Monte Carlo convergence (relevant for masked data) achieved using only a small number of iterations (typically $&lt;10$ for bispectra). This will allow for fast and unified measurement of two- and three-point functions from current and upcoming survey data.</description>

      <title>Exact deconfined gauge structures in the higher-spin Yao-Lee model: a quantum spin-orbital liquid with spin fractionalization and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-S Kitaev model has recently been shown to definitely exhibit topological order with spin liquid ground states for half-integer spin, but could be trivially gapped insulators for integer spin. This interesting "even-odd" effect is largely due to the fermionic (bosonic) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for half-integer (integer) spin. In this Letter, we theoretically show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry) possesses exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for any spin (both integer and half integer spin), which implies a topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state regardless of the value of the spin quantum number. We further study the easy-axis limit of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model which can be solved in a controlled perturbative way and show that it exhibits a gapless QSOL ground state, which can even host a non-Abelian topological order by further considering time-reversal breaking interactions to gap out the Dirac cones of the gapless QSOL.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy Products for NUT class of Black Holes in AdS Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the entropy product rule for Taub-NUT~(Newman-Unti-Tamburino)-de~Sitter black hole~(BH) and Taub-NUT--Anti-de~Sitter BH. We show that the entropy products in terms of both the physical horizons are \emph{mass-independent}. Both \emph{perturbative} approximation and \emph{direct} method have been considered. By introducing the cosmological horizon we show that for Taub-NUT-de~Sitter BH, there exists a mass-independent entropy functional relation in terms of three horizons namely event horizon~(EH), Cauchy horizon~(CH) and cosmological horizon~(CHH) which depends on cosmological parameter~($\Lambda$) and the NUT parameter~($N$). For Taub-NUT-anti-de~Sitter BHs, we determine the mass-independent entropy functional relations in terms of two physical horizons~(namely EH and CH) which depends on only NUT parameter. Some-times some complicated functions of EH entropy and CH entropy are also strictly mass-independent. This is plausible only due to the new formalism developed in~\cite{wu}~[Phys. Rev. D 100, 101501(R)~(2019)] for NUT class of BHs. The formalism states that a generic four-dimensional Taub-NUT spacetime should be described completely in terms of three or four different types of thermodynamic hairs. They could be defined as the Komar mass~($M=m$), the angular momentum~($J_{n}=mn$), the gravitomagnetic charge ($N=n$), the dual~(magnetic) mass $(\tilde{M}=n)$. Finally, we could say that this universality is mainly due to the presence of \emph{new conserved charges $J_{N}=MN$} which is closely analogue to the Kerr-like angular momentum $J=aM$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the $(3+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory coupled with the 2-flavor Wilson-Dirac fermion as a toy model for studying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at nonzero density. We study its phase diagram in the space of the lattice gauge couplings $g^2$ and the quark chemical potentials $\mu$ and discuss the similarity and difference compared with anticipated behaviors of actual QCD. This model also provides a testing ground for various algorithms of the numerical Hamiltonian formalism as its Hilbert space is finite-dimensional in a finite box.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out an interesting connection between the mathematical framework of the Krylov basis used for quantifying quantum complexity and entanglement entropy in high-energy QCD. In particular, we observe that the cascade equation of the dipole model is equivalent to the $SL(2,R)$ Schrodinger equation in the Krylov basis. Consequently, the Krylov complexity corresponds to the average distribution of partons and Krylov entropy matches entanglement entropy computations of \cite{Kharzeev:2017qzs}. Our work not only brings new tools for exploring quantum information and complexity in QCD but also gives hope for experimental tests of some of the recent, physical probes of quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a brief overview of tensor models and group field theories, focusing on their main common features. Both frameworks arose in the context of quantum gravity research, and can be understood as higher-dimensional generalizations of matrix models. We describe the common combinatorial structure underlying such models and review some of the key mathematical results that have been obtained in this area. Of central importance is the discovery of a new family of large $N$ expansions for random tensors. It has driven applications of tensor models to random geometry and non-perturbative local quantum field theory, and has also enabled the development of rigorous renormalization methods for group field theories and other non-local quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weyl double copy builds the relation between gauge theory and gravity theory, especially the correspondence between gauge solutions and gravity solutions. In this paper, we obtain the slowly rotating charge solutions from Weyl double copy for the Kerr black hole with small Chern-Simons correction. Based on the Weyl double copy relation, for the Petrov type D solution, we find the additional correction to the electromagnetic field strength tensor of rotating charge. For the Petrov type I solution, we find that the additional electromagnetic field strength tensors have the exogenous properties, while the total sources vanish at the leading order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in Euclidean spacetime in an effective-model approach. The model incorporates two Polyakov loops along two compactified directions as dynamical variables, and is constructed to reproduce thermodynamics on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ measured on the lattice. The model analysis indicates the existence of a novel first-order phase transition on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ in the deconfined phase, which terminates at critical points that should belong to the two-dimensional $Z_2$ universality class. We argue that the interplay of the Polyakov loops induced by their cross term in the Polyakov-loop potential is responsible for the manifestation of the first-order transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal properties of quantum fields at finite temperature are crucial to understanding strongly interacting matter and recent development in quantum computing has provided an alternative and promising avenue of study. In this work, we study thermal field theories involving only fermions using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the presentations of fermion fields via qubits on digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms such as quantum imaginary time evolutions employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Specifically, we show numerical results such as the thermal distribution and the energy density of thermal field theories for Majorana fermions in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. In addition to free field theory, we also study the effects of interactions resulting from coupling with a spatially homogeneous Majorana field. In both cases, we show analytically that thermal properties of the system can be described using phase-space distributions, and the quantum simulation results agree with analytical and semiclassical expectations. Our work is an important step to understand thermal fixed points, preparing for quantum simulation of thermalization in real time.</description>

      <title>On ${\cal M}$-Theory Dual of Large-$N$ Thermal QCD-Like Theories up to ${\cal O}(R^4)$ and $G$-Structure Classification of Underlying Non-Supersymmetric Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.07259v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Construction of a top-down holographic dual of thermal QCD-like theories (equivalence class of theories which are UV-conformal, IR-confining and have fundamental quarks) {\it at intermediate 't Hooft coupling} and the $G$-structure (torsion classes) classification of the underlying geometries (in the Infra Red (IR)/non-conformal sector in particular) of the {\it non-supersymmetric} string/${\cal M}$-theory duals, have been missing in the literature. We take the first important steps in this direction by studying the ${\cal M}$ theory dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like theories at intermediate gauge and 't Hooft couplings and obtaining the ${\cal O}(l_p^6)$ corrections arising from the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ terms to the "MQGP" background (${\cal M}$-theory dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like theories at intermediate gauge/string coupling, but large 't Hooft coupling) of \cite{MQGP}. The main Physics lesson learnt is that there is a competition between non-conformal IR enhancement and Planckian and large-$N$ suppression and going to orders beyond the ${\cal O}(l_p^6)$ is necessitated if the IR enhancement wins out. The main lesson learnt in Math is in the context of the differential geometry ($G$-structure classification) of the internal manifolds relevant to the string/${\cal M}$-theory duals of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like theories, wherein we obtain for the first time inclusive of the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections in the Infra-Red (IR), the $SU(3)$-structure torsion classes of the type IIA mirror of \cite{metrics} (making contact en route with Siegel theta functions related to appropriate hyperelliptic curves, as well as the Kiepert's algorithm of solving quintics), and the $G_2/SU(4)/Spin(7)$-structure torsion classes of the seven- and eight-folds associated with its ${\cal M}$ theory uplift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the harmonic oscillator problem in non-commutative phase space (NCPS) by using the Dunkl derivative instead of the habitual one. After defining the Hamilton operator, we use the polar coordinates to derive the binding energy eigenvalue. We find eigenfunctions that correspond to these eigenvalues in terms of the Laguerre functions. We observe that the Dunkl-Harmonic Oscillator (DHO) in the NCPS differs from the ordinary one in the context of providing additional information on the even and odd parities. Therefore, we conclude that working with the Dunkl operator could be more appropriate because of its rich content.</description>

Abstract: The smeared Dp-brane is constructed by having the black Dp-brane uniformly smeared over several transverse directions. After integrating the spherical directions and the smeared directions, the smeared Dp-brane turns out to be a Chamblin-Reall model with one background scalar field. Within the framework of the fluid/gravity correspondence, we not only prove the equivalence between the smeared Dp-brane and the compactified Dp-brane by explicitly calculating the 7 dynamical second-order transport coefficients of their dual relativistic fluids, but also revisit the Correlated Stability Conjecture for the smeared Dp-brane via the fluid/gravity correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We propose a regularization procedure in the sourced Weyl double copy, a spinorial version of the classical double copy, such that it matches much more general results in the Kerr-Schild version. In the regularized Weyl double copy, the anti-de Sitter (AdS) and the Lifshitz black holes, which form the basis of the study of strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature through the AdS/CFT correspondence and its non-relativistic generalization, become treatable. We believe that this might pave the way for finding out a relation between the classical double copy and holography.</description>

      <title>Background independent tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional holographic tensor networks can be described as toy holographic maps constructed from many small linear maps acting in a spatially local way, all connected together with ``background entanglement'', i.e. links of a fixed state, often the maximally entangled state. However, these constructions fall short of modeling real holographic maps. One reason is that their ``areas'' are trivial, taking the same value for all states, unlike in gravity where the geometry is dynamical. Recently, new constructions have ameliorated this issue by adding degrees of freedom that ``live on the links''. This makes areas non-trivial, equal to the background entanglement piece plus a new positive piece that depends on the state of the link degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, this still has the downside that there is background entanglement, and hence it only models relatively limited code subspaces in which every area has a definite minimum value given by the background entanglement. In this note, we simply point out that a version of these constructions goes one step further: they can be background independent, with no background entanglement in the holographic map. This is advantageous because it allows tensor networks to model holographic maps for larger code subspaces. In addition to pointing this out, we address some subtleties involved in making it work and point out a nice connection it offers to recent discussions of random CFT data.</description>

Affine quantization leads to a completely satisfactory quantization of field theories using situations that involve scaled behavior leading to an unexpected, $\hbar^2/\varphi^2$ which arises only in the quantum aspects.</description>

Abstract: We argue that Lee-Wick's complex ghost appearing in any higher derivative theory is stable and its asymptotic field exists. It may be more appropriate to call it ``anti-unstable" in the sense that, the more the ghost `decays' into lighter ordinary particles, the larger the probability the ghost remains as itself becomes. This is explicitly shown by analyzing the two-point functions of the ghost Heisenberg field which is obtained as an exact result in the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit in a massive scalar ghost theory with light $O(N)$-vector scalar matter. The anti-instability is a consequence of the fact that the poles of the complex ghost propagator are located on the physical sheet in the complex plane of four-momentum squared. This should be contrasted to the case of the ordinary unstable particle, whose propagator has no pole on the physical sheet.</description>

      <title>Criticality and thermodynamic geometry of quantum BTZ black holes</title>

Abstract: Within the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant acts as the thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate as the thermodynamic volume, we analyze the phase structure and thermodynamic geometry of the three-dimensional quantum-corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. Our results uncover two-phase transitions in the $T-S$ plane across all pressures except at a critical value. Numerical analysis reveals continuous critical phenomena along the coexistence curve, with critical exponents of 2 and 3 for the heat capacity at constant pressure and the NTG curvature, respectively. Importantly, these values notably deviate from the well-known critical exponents observed in mean-field Van der Waals (VdW) fluids, where the NTG curvature and heat capacity demonstrate discontinuous criticality. To our knowledge, our investigation is the first exploration of critical behavior in black holes incorporating consistent semiclassical backreaction.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields, localized structures and the Starobinsky model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work deals with the presence of localized static structures in the real line, described by relativistic real scalar fields in two spacetime dimensions. We consider models featuring both standard and modified kinematics, where we employ two intriguing potentials supporting defect solutions. The first potential can transform kink into compacton in the standard framework, while the second one is based on the inflationary Starobinsky model. Interesting possibilities unseen in previous investigations are described, in particular, for the case related to the Starobinsky potential. The addressed potentials are inserted into a broader framework, and so the extended models are described by a wider set of solutions. This investigation also reveals the presence of the twinlike behavior for a specific compact configuration, which solves two distinct models.</description>

      <title>Spectral Form Factors of Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signatures of dynamical quantum phase transitions and chaos can be found in the time evolution of generalized partition functions such as spectral form factors (SFF) and Loschmidt echoes. While a lot of work has focused on the nature of such systems in a variety of strongly interacting quantum theories, in this work, we study their behavior in short-range entangled topological phases, particularly focusing on the role of symmetry-protected topological zero modes. We show, using both analytical and numerical methods, how the existence of such zero modes in any representative system can mask the SFF with large period (akin to generalized Rabi) oscillations, hiding any behavior arising from the bulk of the spectrum. Moreover, in a quenched disordered system, these zero modes fundamentally change the late-time universal behavior reflecting the chaotic signatures of the zero-energy manifold. Our study uncovers the rich physics underlying the interplay of chaotic signatures and topological characteristics in a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Hyperhydrodynamics: Relativistic Viscous Fluids Emerging from Hypermomentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a new action formulation of hyperfluids, fluids with intrinsic hypermomentum. Brown's Lagrangian for a relativistic perfect fluid is generalised by incorporating the degrees of freedom encoded in the hypermomentum tensor, namely by including connection-matter couplings. Quite interestingly, generic hyperfluids are imperfect, since hypermomentum induces such effects as bulk and shear viscosities as well as heat fluxes. The various coefficients that appear in the first order expansion of hydrodynamics can now be deduced from a Lagrangian formulation, given a geometrical interpretation and a suggested microscopic description in terms of hypermomentum. This connection between hypermomentum and dissipative fluids could shed new light on the physics of relativistic hydrodynamics. The applicability of the new formalism is demonstrated by exact cosmological solutions.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals black holes in rainbow gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Rajagapol et al presented an asymptotically AdS black hole metric whose thermodynamics qualitatively mimics the behavior of the Van der Waals fluid by treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. In some studies in the literature, authors have discussed the effects of deformed algebras such as generalized and extended uncertainty principles on the thermal quantities of these black holes. In this manuscript, we considered another deformation, the rainbow gravity formalism, and we investigated its impact on the Van der Waal black hole thermodynamics. To this end, we first generated the modified lapse and mass functions, and then we derived the modified thermal quantities such as thermodynamic volume, Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat functions. Finally, we explored the thermodynamics of a black hole, which mimics the thermodynamics of an ideal gas, under the influence of the rainbow gravity formalism.</description>

      <title>On the Wormhole--Warp Drive Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a correspondence between the Morris--Thorne wormhole metric and a warp drive metric, which generalizes an earlier result by H. Ellis regarding the Schwarzschild black hole metric and makes it possible to embed a warp drive in a wormhole background. We demonstrate that in order to do that, one needs to also generalize the Natario--Alcubierre definition of warp drive and introduce nonzero intrinsic curvature. However, we also find out that in order to be traversable by a warp drive, the wormhole should have a horizon: in other words, humanly traversable wormholes cannot be traversed by a warp drive, and vice versa. We also discuss possible loopholes in this "no-go" theorem</description>
