      <title>Smooth rigidity for 3-dimensional dissipative Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two transitive $3$-dimensional Anosov flows which do not preserve volume and which are continuously conjugate to each other. Then, disregarding certain exceptional cases, such as flows with $C^1$ regular stable or unstable distributions, we prove that either the conjugacy is smooth or it sends the positive SRB measure of the first flow to the negative SRB measure of the second flow and vice versa. We give a number of corollaries of this result. In particular, we establish local rigidity on a $C^1$-open $C^\infty$-dense subspace of transitive Anosov flows; we improve the classical de la Llave-Marco-Moriy\'on rigidity theorem for dissipative Anosov diffeomorphisms on the $2$-torus by merely assuming matching of (full) Jacobian data at periodic points; we also exhibit the first evidence that the Teichm\"uller space of smooth conjugacy classes of Anosov diffeomorphisms on the $2$-torus is well-stratified according to regularity.</description>

      <title>Discontinuity of Lyapunov exponent in spaces of quasiperiodic cocycles: Smoothness vs Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct examples of discontinuity of Lyapunov exponent in the spaces of quasiperiodic $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$-cocycles for fixed irrational frequencies. Especially, we prove that the Gevrey space $G^2$ is the transition space of continuity for all strong Diophantine frequencies. We also construct examples of discontinuity for other frequencies in less smooth spaces, which show that the more difficult it is to approximate the frequency with rational numbers, the more likely it is to exhibit discontinuity in smoother spaces.</description>

      <title>Integrable nonlinear oscillators with polynomial invariants: construction, Poincare geometry, and an analytic stability boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the nonlinear ODE $z'' + f(t)\,z + g(t)\, z^{m}=0$ with $m&gt;1$, we show that after a suitable normal-form reduction of any Hill equation one may, without loss of generality, fix the linear part as $f(t)\equiv \omega^{2}$ (with $\omega&gt;0$ constant). For the class $z''+\omega^{2}z+g(t)\, z^{m}=0$ with $m&gt;1$, our goal is to compile a catalogue of all possible integrable cases. We restrict attention to integrals that are polynomial in the variables $z$ and $p=z'$. The Hamiltonian does not provide such an integral because it is explicitly time dependent. Instead, we search for invariants that are quadratic in $p=z'$. We show that such invariants exist precisely when $\alpha_2(t):=g(t)^{-2/(m+3)}$ satisfies the linear third-order ODE $\alpha_2''' + 4\omega^2 \alpha_2'=0$. This yields the three-parameter solution $g(t)=[a_0+a_1\cos(2\omega t)+a_2\sin(2\omega t)]^{-(m+3)/2}$. For $m=2$ this reproduces the trigonometric structure with exponent $-5/2$ found in Hagel--Bouquet (1992). In addition we present a detailed stability analysis based on the invariant using Poincar\'e sections and find full agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Resonant vector bundles, conjugate points, and the stability of pulse solutions to the {S}wift-{H}ohenberg equation using validated numerics: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop new theory connected with resonant vector bundles that will allow for the use of validated numerics to rigorously determine the stability of pulse solutions in the context of the Swift-Hohenberg equation. For many PDEs, the stability of stationary solutions is determined by the absence of point spectra in the open right half of the complex plane. Recently, theoretical developments have allowed one to use objects called conjugate points to detect such unstable eigenvalues for certain linearized operators. Moreover, in certain cases these conjugate points can themselves be detected using validated numerics. The aim of this work is to extend this framework to contexts where the vector bundles, which control the existence of conjugate points, have certain resonances. Such resonances can prevent the use of standard (though involved) techniques in computer assisted proofs, and in this paper we provide a method to overcome this obstacle. Due to its length, the analysis has been divided into two parts: Part I in the present work, and Part II in [BJPS25].</description>

      <title>A natural decomposition of the Jacobi equation for some classes of $N$-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider several $N$-body problems. The main result is a very simple and natural criterion for decoupling the Jacobi equation for some classes of them. If $E$ is a Euclidean space, and the potential function $U(x)$ for the $N$-body problem is a $C^2$ function defined in an open subset of $E^N$, then the Jacobi equation along a given motion $x(t)$ writes $\ddot J=HU_x(J)$, where the endomorphism $HU_x$ of $E^N$ represents the second derivative of the potential with respect to the mass inner product.
  Our splitting in particular applies to the case of homographic motions by central configurations. It allows then to deduce the well known Meyer-Schmidt decomposition for the linearization of the Euler-Lagrange flow in the phase space, formulated twenty years ago to study the relative equilibria of the planar $N$-body problem. However, our decomposition principle applies in many other classes of $N$-body problems, for instance to the case of isosceles three body problem, in which Sitnikov proved the existence of oscillatory motions.
  As a first concrete application, for the classical three-body problem we give a simple and short proof of a theorem of Y. Ou, ensuring that if the masses verify $\mu=(m_1+m_2+m_3)^2/(m_1m_2+m_2m_3+m_1m_3)&lt;27/8$ then the elliptic Lagrange solutions are linearly unstable for any value of the excentricity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct geometrically infinite hyperbolic surfaces supporting horocycles with tailored recurrence properties. In particular, we obtain the first examples of non-trivial minimal horocyclic orbit closures and of infinite locally-finite conservative horocyclic invariant measures which are singular with respect to the geodesic flow. Other examples include surfaces supporting horocyclic orbit closures of arbitrary Hausdorff dimension in $(1,2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give some natural conditions on actions of discrete countable groups on abelian locally compact groups of Lie type that imply factoriality of the group von Neumann algebras of their semidirect products. This allows us to give a fairly large class of examples of locally compact groups whose group von Neumann algebras are factors.</description>

      <title>Graph conductance, synchronization, and a new bottleneck measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a quantification of the main bottleneck to flow over a graph, the network property of conductance plays an important role in the process of synchronization of network-coupled dynamical systems. Diffusive coupling terms serve not only to exchange information between nodes within a networked system, but ultimately to dissipate the entropy of the collective dynamic state down toward that which can be associated with a single dynamic node when the synchronization manifold is stable. While the graph conductance can characterize the coupling strength that is required to maintain widespread synchronization across a majority of the nodes in such a system, it offers no guarantee for a stable synchronization manifold, which involves all nodes in the system. We define a new measure called the synchronization bottleneck of a graph, which we denote by $\Xi$; this new network property provides a quantification of the limiting bottleneck of the flow between any subset of nodes (regardless of its order) and the rest of the networked system. This quantity does control the coupling strength required for a stable synchronization manifold for a large class of dynamical systems. Solving for this quantity is combinatorial, as is the case with conductance, but heuristics based on this optimization problem can guide decentralized strategies for improving global synchronizability.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of sets of continued fractions with unbounded partial quotients along subsequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $x=[a_1(x),a_2(x),\ldots]$ be the continued fraction expansion of $x\in[0,1)$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of \begin{equation*}E_{even}=\{x\in[0,1)\colon a_{2n}(x)\to\infty\ (n\to\infty)\}.\end{equation*} is 1/2. In general, we study the set of continued fractions with unbounded partial quotients along subsequence \begin{equation*}E_{\{k_n\}}=\{x\in[0,1)\colon a_{k_n}(x)\to\infty\ (n\to\infty)\},\end{equation*} where $\{k_n\}\subset\mathbb{N}$ is a subsequence. We show that $E_{\{k_n\}}$ has Hausdorff dimension 1/2 or 1 according to whether the set of indices $\{k_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ has positive or zero density respectively.</description>

      <title>EddyFormer: Accelerated Neural Simulations of Three-Dimensional Turbulence at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM) architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features. We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows, EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Local Central Limit Theorems (LLT) for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is a Markov chains with equicontinuous conditional probabilities satisfying contraction conditions close in spirit to Dobrushin's, and some ``physicality" assumptions and $f_j$ are equicontinuous functions. Our conditions will always be in force when the chain takes values on a metric space and have uniformly bounded away from $0$ backward transition densities with respect to a measure which assigns uniform positive mass to certain ``balls".
  This paper complements \cite{MarShif1} where Berry-Esseen theorems, were proven for (not necessarily continuous) functions satisfying certain approximation conditions. Our results address a question posed by D. Dolgopyat and O. Sarig in \cite[Section 1.5]{DS}.</description>

Abstract: Classic results by L.-S. Young show that the decay of correlations for systems that admit inducing schemes can be obtained through the recurrence rates of the inducing scheme. Reciprocal results were obtained for non-invertible systems (without contracting directions). Here, we obtain reciprocal results also for invertible systems (with contracting directions).</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional piecewise contractions are asymptotically periodic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Piecewise contractions (PCs) are piecewise smooth maps that decrease distance between pairs of points in the same domain of continuity. The dynamics of a variety of systems is described by PCs. During the last decade, a lot of effort has been devoted to proving that in parametrized families of one-dimensional PCs, the $\omega$-limit set of a typical PC consists of finitely many periodic orbits while there exist atypical PCs with Cantor $\omega$-limit sets. In this article, we extend these results to the multi-dimensional case. More precisely, we provide criteria to show that an arbitrary family $\{f_{\mu}\}_{\mu\in U}$ of locally bi-Lipschitz piecewise contractions $f_\mu:X\to X$ defined on a compact metric space $X$ is asymptotically periodic for Lebesgue almost every parameter $\mu$ running over an open subset $U$ of the $M$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^M$. As a corollary of our results, we prove that piecewise affine contractions of $\mathbb{R}^d$ defined in generic polyhedral partitions are asymptotically periodic.</description>

We compute the Hausdorff, box-counting and Assouad dimensions of the graph for a typical choice of parameter. Furthermore, we study the dimension of the level sets. We give an upper bound on the dimension of every level set, and we show that for a typical choice of parameters this value is attained for Lebesgue almost every level sets.</description>

      <title>Young structures for partially hyperbolic systems with mostly contracting central direction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of Young structures for a broad class of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with a splitting $TM = E^{cs} \oplus E^{uu}$, under exactly the same conditions that ensure the existence of SRB measures in a previous work by Bonatti and Viana. This extends the applicability of statistical techniques to systems where statistical properties remained largely unexplored. Our approach refines previous methods, introducing key adaptations to the partially hyperbolic setting. These results provide a foundation for obtaining decay of correlations, Central Limit Theorem, large deviations and a vector-valued almost sure invariance principle in this class of dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: We study a fast-slow version of the Bazykin-Berezovskaya predator-prey model with Allee effect evolving on two timescales, through the lenses of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). The system we consider is in non-standard form. We completely characterize its dynamics, providing explicit threshold quantities to distinguish between a rich variety of possible asymptotic behaviors. Moreover, we propose numerical results to illustrate our findings. Lastly, we comment on the real-world interpretation of these results, in an economic framework and in the context of predator-prey models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Poisson boundary of random walks of finite entropy on Zariski-dense discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups equals the Furstenberg boundary of the corresponding symmetric spaces equipped with the hitting measure, without assuming any moment condition on the random walk.</description>

      <title>Annealed and quenched representations of the Gauss-R\'enyi measure by "periodic points"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider independently identically distributed random compositions of the Gauss and R\'enyi maps that generate random continued fractions. Using methods of ergodic theory, thermodynamic formalism and large deviations, we show that weighted cycles of this random dynamical system equidistribute with respect to the Gauss-R\'enyi measure. We present both annealed (sample-averaged) and quenched (samplewise) results.</description>

      <title>Questions in linear recurrence: From the $T\oplus T$-problem to lineability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study, for a continuous linear operator $T$ on an F-space $X$, when the direct sum operator $T\oplus T$ is recurrent on $X\oplus X$. In particular: we establish, for recurrence, the analogous notion to that of (topological) weak-mixing for transitivity/hypercyclicity, namely quasi-rigidity; and we construct a recurrent but not quasi-rigid operator on each infinite-dimensional Banach space, solving the $T\oplus T$-recurrence problem in the negative way. The quasi-rigidity notion is closely related to the dense lineability of the set of recurrent vectors, and using similar conditions we study the lineability and dense lineability properties for the set of $\mathcal{F}$-recurrent vectors.

      <title>Schr\"odinger bridge for generative AI: Soft-constrained formulation and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling, fine-tuning, and transfer learning.</description>
