      <title>Radio-Frequency Spectroscopy and the Dimensional Crossover in Interacting Spin-Polarized Fermi Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional ultracold gases are created in the laboratory by confining three-dimensional (3D) gases inside highly anisotropic trapping potentials. Such trap geometries not only provide access to simulating one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) physics, but also can be used to study how the system crosses over towards a 3D system in the limit of weak confinement. In this work, we study the signature in radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy for both the 1D-to-3D and the 2D-to-3D crossovers, in spin-polarized Fermi gases. We solve the two-body scattering T-matrix in the presence of strong harmonic confinement and use it to evaluate the two-body bound state and the RF spectroscopy transfer rate in the high frequency limit, covering both the quasi-low-dimensional and 3D limits. We find that in order to understand the dimensional crossover for spin-polarized Fermi gases with p-wave interactions, one needs to take into account an emergent s-wave interaction.</description>

      <title>The impact of quantum noise on limit cycles and entrainment in an atom-cavity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum noise is inherent in any open quantum system as it affects not only the statistical properties of the initial state but also the time evolution of the system. A transversely pumped atom-cavity setup is a prototypical example of such an open system, wherein limit cycles (LCs) have been observed and identified as continuous time crystals (CTCs). Using truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we show that the inherent quantum noise pushes the system to exhibit signatures of LCs for interaction strengths lower than the critical value predicted by mean-field theory, suggesting a noise-induced enhancement of temporal ordering. By comparing the oscillation frequencies of the LCs for the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) regimes, we find that the LC frequencies have larger shot-to-shot fluctuations in 1D than in 2D. We demonstrate that this has an important consequence in the effectiveness of entrainment of LCs for a periodically driven pump intensity or light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced dynamical self-organized twisted-bilayer lattices in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating crystal bilayers twisted with respect to each other would lead to large periodic supercell structures, which can support a wide range of novel electron correlated phenomena, where the full understanding is still under debate. Here, we propose a new scheme to realize a nonlinearity-induced dynamical self-organized twisted-bilayer lattice in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The key idea here is to utilize the nonlinear effect from the intrinsic atomic interactions to couple different layers and induce a dynamical self-organized supercell structure, dramatically distinct from the conventional wisdom to achieve the static twisted-bilayer lattices. To illustrate that, we study the dynamics of a two-component BEC and show that the nonlinear interaction effect naturally emerged in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of interacting bosonic ultracold atoms can dynamically induce both periodic (commensurable) and aperiodic (incommensurable) moir\'{e} structures. One of the interesting moir\'{e} phenomena, i.e., the flat-band physics, is shown through investigating the dynamics of the wave packet of BEC. Our proposal can be implemented using available state-of-the-art experimental techniques and reveal a profound connection between the nonlinearity and twistronics in cold atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Interpretable correlator Transformer for image-like quantum matter data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their inherent capabilities of capturing non-local dependencies, Transformer neural networks have quickly been established as the paradigmatic architecture for large language models and image processing. Next to these traditional applications, machine learning methods have also been demonstrated to be versatile tools in the analysis of image-like data of quantum phases of matter, e.g. given snapshots of many-body wave functions obtained in ultracold atom experiments. While local correlation structures in image-like data of physical systems can reliably be detected, identifying phases of matter characterized by global, non-local structures with interpretable machine learning methods remains a challenge. Here, we introduce the correlator Transformer (CoTra), which classifies different phases of matter while at the same time yielding full interpretability in terms of physical correlation functions. The network's underlying structure is a tailored attention mechanism, which learns efficient ways to weigh local and non-local correlations for a successful classification. We demonstrate the versatility of the CoTra by detecting local order in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, and show that local gauge constraints in one- and two-dimensional lattice gauge theories can be identified. Furthermore, we establish that the CoTra reliably detects non-local structures in images of correlated fermions in momentum space (Cooper pairs) and that it can distinguish percolating from non-percolating images.</description>

      <title>Low energy excitations in bosonic quantum quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first principles construction of the low-energy effective action for bosonic self-organized quantum quasicrystals. Our generalized elasticity approach retains the appropriate number of phase- and corresponding conjugate density- degrees-of-freedom required for a proper description of the Goldstone modes. For the dodecagonal and decagonal quasicrystal structures we obtain collective longitudinal and transversal excitations with an isotropic speed of sound. Meanwhile, for the octagonal structure, the coupling between phononic and phasonic degrees of freedom leads in turn to hybridization of the latter with the condensate sound mode, producing collective excitations with a longitudinal and transversal component, and an anisotropic speed of sound. Finally, we discuss the fate of each excitation mode at the low and high density phase transitions limiting the quantum quasicrystal phase.</description>

      <title>Slow decay rate of correlations induced by long-range extended Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the extended XY model on the phase diagram as well as the static and dynamical properties of quantum and classical correlation functions. It is known that in the nearest-neighbor XY model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power-law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a non-equilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Magnetic Flux in Rydberg Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for generating homogeneous and tunable magnetic flux for bosonic particles in a lattice using Rydberg atoms. Our setup relies on Rydberg excitations hopping through the lattice by dipolar exchange interactions. The magnetic flux arises from complex hopping via ancilla atoms. Remarkably, the total flux within a magnetic unit cell directly depends on the ratio of the number of lattice sites to ancilla atoms, making it topologically protected to small changes in the positions of the atoms. This allows us to optimize the positions of the ancilla atoms to make the flux through the magnetic unit cell homogeneous. With this homogeneous flux, we get a topological flat band in the single-particle regime. In the many-body regime, we obtain indications of a bosonic fractional Chern insulator state at $\nu = 1/2$ filling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov-state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the complexity compared to that obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises two subspaces with a weak coupling between them.</description>

      <title>Tunneling dynamics of $^{164}$Dy supersolids and droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tunneling dynamics of a magnetic $^{164}$Dy quantum gas in an elongated or pancake skewed double-well trap is investigated with a time-dependent extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. Upon lifting the energy offset, different tunneling regimes can be identified. In the elongated trap and for sufficiently large offset, the different configurations exhibit collective macroscopic tunneling. For smaller offset, partial reflection from and transmission through the barrier lead to density accumulation in both wells, and eventually to tunneling-locking. One can also reach the macroscopic self-trapping regime for increasing relative dipolar interaction strength, while tunneling vanishes for large barrier heights. A richer dynamical behavior is observed for the pancake-like trap. For instance, the supersolid maintains its shape, while the superfluid density gets distorted signifying the emergence of peculiar excitation patterns in the macroscopic tunneling regime. The findings reported here may offer new ways to probe distinctive dynamical features in the supersolid and droplet regimes.</description>

      <title>Resonance Cascades and Number Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we are interested in situations where the existence of a contiguous cascade of quantum resonant transitions is predicated on the validity of a particular statement in number theory. The setting is a tailored one-atom one-dimensional potential with a prescribed spectrum, under a weak periodic perturbation. The former is, by now, an experimental reality [D. Cassettari, G. Mussardo and A. Trombettoni, PNAS Nexus 2, pgac279 (2022)]. As a case study, we look at the following trivial statement: "Any power of $3$ is an integer." Consequently, we "test" this statement in a numerical experiment where we demonstrate an unimpeded upward mobility along an equidistant, $\ln(3)$-spaced subsequence of the energy levels of a potential with a log-natural spectrum, under a frequency $\ln(3)$ time-periodic perturbation. We further show when we "remove" $9$ from the set of integers -- by excluding the corresponding energy level from the spectrum -- the cascade halts abruptly.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity in Rydberg tweezer arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between Rydberg atoms, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. For repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments on the triangular lattice supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on explicitly calculated pair interactions for ${}^{87}$Rb and with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.</description>

      <title>Realizing Topological Superconductivity in Tunable Bose-Fermi Mixtures with Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a promising platform for investigating exotic correlated states of matter. Here, we propose to engineer Bose-Fermi mixtures in these systems by coupling inter-layer excitons to doped charges in a trilayer structure. Their interactions are determined by the inter-layer trion, whose spin-selective nature allows excitons to mediate an attractive interaction between charge carriers of only one spin species. Remarkably, we find that this causes the system to become unstable to topological p+ip superconductivity at low temperatures. We then demonstrate a general mechanism to develop and control this unconventional state by tuning the trion binding energy using a solid-state Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Multicritical dissipative phase transitions in the anisotropic open quantum Rabi model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium steady state of the anisotropic open quantum Rabi model, which exhibits first-order and second-order dissipative phase transitions upon varying the degree of anisotropy between the coupling strengths of rotating and counterrotating terms. Using both semiclassical and quantum approaches, we find a rich phase diagram resulting from the interplay between the anisotropy and the dissipation. First, there exists a bistable phase where both the normal and superradiant phases are stable. Second, there are multicritical points where the phase boundaries for the first- and second-order phase transitions meet. We show that a new set of critical exponents governs the scaling of the multicritical points. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of observing the multicritical transitions and bistability using a pair of trapped ions where the anisotropy can be tuned by controlling the intensity of the Raman transitions. Our study enlarges the scope of critical phenomena that may occur in finite-component quantum systems, which could be useful for applications in critical quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: We propose a non-cryogenic optical quantum memory for noble-gas nuclear spins based on the Atomic Frequency Comb (AFC) protocol. Owing to the hours-long coherence lifetimes of the noble-gas spins and the large bandwidth provided by the AFC independently of the optical depth, we estimate a time-bandwidth product of up to $9.7 \times 10^{15}$ for a realistic experimental configuration, using alkali-metal atoms as mediators. Leveraging this long-lived multimode memory, we propose a fiber-based quantum repeater scheme that could enable entanglement distribution across distances over $2000 \ \mathrm{km}$ with only $8$ elementary links, operating fully without cryogenics. Finally, we discuss how these quantum memories can enhance rates in satellite quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Realizing Topological Quantum Walks on NISQ Digital Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum walk on the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) lattice with periodic modulation using a digital quantum computer. We investigate various initial states at the single-particle level, considering different hopping modulation strengths and phase factors. Initiating the quantum walk with a particle at the lattice edge reveals the robustness of the edge state, attributed to the topological nature of the AAH model, and displays the influence of the phase factor on this edge state. On the other hand, when the quantum walk begins with a particle in the lattice bulk, we observe a repulsion of the bulk walker from the edge, especially under strong hopping modulation. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the quantum walk of two particles with nearest-neighbour (NN) interaction. We show the repulsion effect in the quantum walk when two walkers originate from the edge and bulk of the lattice due to the interaction. Additionally, when two particles are positioned at NN sites and subjected to strong hopping modulation strength, they exhibit localization in the presence of interaction. We analyze these phenomena by examining physical quantities such as density evolution, two-particle correlation, and participation entropy, and discuss their potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points are exotic transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm. They are associated to a one-point gap closing between distinct locally ordered phases, thus to a continuous phase transition. Because of this intrinsic criticality, at deconfined quantum critical points algebraic decay of all the correlation functions is expected. Here, we show that it is possible to go beyond this assumption. Specifically, we consider one dimensional interacting fermions where the phenomenon of spin-charge separation arises. We first explore the low energy regimes where a sine-Gordon Hamiltonian can provide accurate results. By means of a field theory approach we find that continuous phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can occur. As a consequence of the decoupled spin and charge degrees of freedom, we find that in two cases only one gap vanishes while the other remains finite. We then derive a microscopic model where such phase transitions take place. By performing a numerical analysis, we unambiguously find that deconfined quantum critical points can indeed be further characterized by the long-range order of a parity operator signaling the presence of a finite gap. Our results provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.</description>
