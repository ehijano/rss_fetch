      <title>Distribution-informed and wavelength-flexible data-driven photoacoustic oximetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) promises to measure spatially-resolved blood oxygen saturation, but suffers from a lack of accurate and robust spectral unmixing methods to deliver on this promise. Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation.
  Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture.
  Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset.
  Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application.
  Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Positronium Lifetime Imaging through Two-Component Reconstruction in Time-of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a crucial tool in medical imaging, particularly for diagnosing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. The advent of Positronium Lifetime Imaging (PLI) has opened new avenues for assessing the tissue micro-environment, which is vital for early-stage disease detection. In this study, we introduce a two-component reconstruction model for PLI in Time-of-Flight (TOF) PET, incorporating both ortho-positronium and para-positronium decays. Our model enhances the accuracy of positronium imaging by providing a more detailed representation of the tissue environment. We conducted simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our model and compared it with existing single-component models. The results demonstrate the superiority of the two-component model in capturing the intricacies of the tissue micro-environment, thus paving the way for more precise and informative PET diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Digital twin model of colon electromechanics for manometry prediction of laser tissue soldering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study introduces an advanced multi-physics and multi-scale modeling approach to investigate in silico colon motility. We introduce a generalized electromechanical framework, integrating cellular electrophysiology and smooth muscle contractility, thus advancing a first-of-its-kind computational model of laser tissue soldering after incision resection. The proposed theoretical framework comprises three main elements: a microstructural material model describing intestine wall geometry and composition of reinforcing fibers, with four fiber families, two active-conductive and two passive; an electrophysiological model describing the propagation of slow waves, based on a fully-coupled nonlinear phenomenological approach; and a thermodynamical consistent mechanical model describing the hyperelastic energetic contributions ruling tissue equilibrium under diverse loading conditions. The active strain approach was adopted to describe tissue electromechanics by exploiting the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient for each active fiber family and solving the governing equations via a staggered finite element scheme. The computational framework was fine-tuned according to state-of-the-art experimental evidence, and extensive numerical analyses allowed us to compare manometric traces computed via numerical simulations with those obtained clinically in human patients. The model proved capable of reproducing both qualitatively and quantitatively high or low-amplitude propagation contractions. Colon motility after laser tissue soldering demonstrates that material properties and couplings of the deposited tissue are critical to reproducing a physiological muscular contraction, thus restoring a proper peristaltic activity.</description>

      <title>Time-efficient, high-resolution 3T whole-brain relaxometry using Cartesian 3D MR-STAT with CSF suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Current 3D Magnetic Resonance Spin TomogrAphy in Time-domain (MR-STAT) protocols use transient-state, gradient-spoiled gradient-echo sequences that are prone to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsation artifacts when applied to the brain. This study aims at developing a 3D MR-STAT protocol for whole-brain relaxometry that overcomes the challenges posed by CSF-induced ghosting artifacts. Method: We optimized the flip-angle train within the Cartesian 3D MR-STAT framework to achieve two objectives: (1) minimization of the noise level in the reconstructed quantitative maps, and (2) reduction of the CSF-to-white-matter signal ratio to suppress CSF signal and the associated pulsation artifacts. The optimized new sequence was tested on a gel/water-phantom to evaluate the accuracy of the quantitative maps, and on healthy volunteers to explore the effectiveness of the CSF artifact suppression and robustness of the new protocol. Results: A new optimized sequence with both high parameter encoding capability and low CSF intensity was proposed and initially validated in the gel/water-phantom experiment. From in-vivo experiments with five volunteers, the proposed CSF-suppressed sequence shows no CSF ghosting artifacts and overall greatly improved image quality for all quantitative maps compared to the baseline sequence. Statistical analysis indicated low inter-subject and inter-scan variability for quantitative parameters in gray matter and white matter (1.6%-2.4% for T1 and 2.0%-4.6% for T2), demonstrating the robustness of the new sequence. Conclusion: We presented a new 3D MR-STAT sequence with CSF suppression that effectively eliminates CSF pulsation artifacts. The new sequence ensures consistently high-quality, 1mm^3 whole-brain relaxometry within a rapid 5.5-minute scan time.</description>

      <title>Identifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder through the electroencephalogram complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are reasons to suggest that a number of mental disorders may be related to alteration in the neural complexity (NC). Thus, quantitative analysis of NC could be helpful in classifying mental conditions and clarifying our understanding about them. Here, we have worked with youths, typical and with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whose neural complexity was assessed using q-statistics applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG was recorded while subjects performed the visual Attention Network Test (ANT) based on the OddBall paradigm and during a shortpretask period of resting state. Time intervals of the EEG amplitudes that passed a threshold (signal regularity indicator) were collected from task and pretask signals from each subject. The data were satisfactorily fitted with a stretched $q$-exponential including a power-law prefactor(characterized by the exponent c), thus determining the best $(c, q)$ for each subject, indicative of their individual complexity. We found larger values of $q$ and $c$ in ADHD subjects as compared with the typical subjects both at task and pretask periods, the task values for both groups being larger than at rest. The $c$ parameter was highly specific in relation to DSM diagnosis for inattention, where well-defined clusters were observed. The parameter values were organized in four well-defined clusters in $(c, q)$-space. As expected, the tasks apparently induced greater complexity in neural functional states with likely greater amount of internal information processing. The results suggest that complexity is higher in ADHD subjects than in typical pairs. The distribution of values in the $(c, q)$-space derived from $q$-statistics seems to be a promising biomarker for ADHD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Neurophotonics beyond the Surface: Unmasking the Brain's Complexity Exploiting Optical Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate nature of the brain necessitates the application of advanced probing techniques to comprehensively study and understand its working mechanisms. Neurophotonics offers minimally invasive methods to probe the brain using optics at cellular and even molecular levels. However, multiple challenges persist, especially concerning imaging depth, field of view, speed, and biocompatibility. A major hindrance to solving these challenges in optics is the scattering nature of the brain. This perspective highlights the potential of complex media optics, a specialized area of study focused on light propagation in materials with intricate heterogeneous optical properties, in advancing and improving neuronal readouts for structural imaging and optical recordings of neuronal activity. Key strategies include wavefront shaping techniques and computational imaging and sensing techniques that exploit scattering properties for enhanced performance. We discuss the potential merger of the two fields as well as potential challenges and perspectives toward longer term in vivo applications.</description>

      <title>Water exchange and microscopic kurtosis -- two sides of the same coin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion MRI is sensitive to a wide range of features of the microstructure including diffusivity, exchange and three sources of diffusional kurtosis: isotropic, anisotropic, and microscopic. Correlation tensor imaging (CTI) uses double diffusion encoding (DDE) to resolve all three kurtosis components. In that framework, microscopic kurtosis is estimated from the contrast between SDE and parallel DDE signals at the same b-value. Another approach is multi-Gaussian exchange (MGE), which can apply DDE to measure exchange. The highest exchange sensitivity in MGE is obtained by contrasting SDE and DDE signals at the same b-value. CTI and MGE can thus be applied to analyse the same data, but exchange can bias microscopic kurtosis estimates if not accounted for, and vice versa. Here, we develop new theory (MGE incorporating microscopic kurtosis, {\mu}MGE) that accounts for both effects, by exploiting the distinct signatures of exchange and microscopic kurtosis with varying mixing time: exchange causes a dependence of the signal on mixing time while microscopic kurtosis does not. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations in different geometries with varying levels of exchange and study the behaviour of the parameters from CTI, MGE, and {\mu}MGE. We conclude that microscopic kurtosis from CTI is positively biased by exchange. We also find that applying {\mu}MGE to data acquired with multiple mixing times for both parallel and orthogonal DDE allows accurate estimation of exchange and all three sources of kurtosis.</description>
