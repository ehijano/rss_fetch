      <title>Microwave pulse transparency in Flux-qubit based superconducting quantum metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the propagation of a classical microwave pulse through a simple setup of a quantum metamaterial composed of a large number of three-Josephson-junction flux qubits. We find that population inversion and electromagnetic waves propagate together as two-component nonlinear waves, exhibiting distinct features depending on the initial preparation of the qubit subsystem and the strength of the "matter"-light interaction.
  Three different regimes are observed. In the limit of weak nonlinearity, when all qubits are initially prepared in either the clockwise or counterclockwise persistent current state, population inversion undergoes coherent Rabi-like oscillations, with a complete transfer between these two opposite states. As nonlinearity approaches unity, the transition dynamics lose their oscillatory nature, and the system rapidly becomes frozen in a state of zero population inversion, where each qubit is trapped in a superposition with equal probabilities of clockwise and counterclockwise polarity. In the overcritical regime, population inversion exhibits pulsating behavior, but without complete transfer. In the extreme coupling limit, population inversion undergoes small-amplitude oscillations around its initial value, while the pulse amplitude oscillates around zero, indicating pulse stopping.</description>

      <title>Evidence of magnetoelastic coupling and magnetic phase coexistence in Mn$_{1.7}$Fe$_{1.3}$Si Heusler Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncollinear metallic antiferromagnets, with their rapid spin dynamics, efficient spin transport, and distinctive spin textures, play a pivotal role in advancing the field of spintronics. In this study, we report a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and transport properties of cubic Mn$_{1.7}$Fe$_{1.3}$Si Heusler compound. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurement reveals a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition at $T_C$ = 85 K, followed by a spin reorientation transition. Neutron diffraction data, analyzed as a function of temperature, demonstrates that the occurrence of a spin-reorientation transition is accompanied by magnetoelastic coupling, as evidenced by a change in unit cell volume below $T_C$. Magnetic structure refinement of the low-temperature neutron powder diffraction data confirms the canted antiferromagnetic ordering below 55 K. The metallic nature of the sample is confirmed by the gradual decrease in the $\rho$(T) with decreasing temperature. At low temperatures, a field-induced metamgnetic transition is observed in both, magnetization and magneto-transport measurements. The $H-T$ phase diagram shows a phase-coexistence region emerging at low temperatures for H $&lt;$ 2.5 T. These findings provide valuable insights into the magnetic and transport behavior of the Heusler compounds, underscoring their potential for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Transverse vortices induced by modulated granular shear flows of elongated particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed DEM simulations of elongated grains in a shear cell for various particle aspect ratios and contact frictions, with an additional heterogeneous force perturbation in the flow direction. For a perturbation in the form of a single Fourier mode, we show that the response of the system consists of transverse secondary flows that average onto a pattern of four vortices. We have also theoretically studied this phenomenon by generalizing the granular rheology $\mu(I)$ to the case of elongated grains and computing the linear response to such a perturbation. Even if the agreement between theory and simulations remains qualitative only, we can reproduce and understand the inversion of the vortex pattern when the cell aspect ratio is increased from a vertically to a horizontally elongated cell shape, emphasizing the key role of the second normal stress difference as well as the cell geometry.</description>

      <title>Strong field physics in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dephasing is the loss of phase coherence due to the interaction of an electron with the environment. The most common approach to model dephasing in light-matter interaction is the relaxation time approximation. Surprisingly, its use in intense laser physics results in a pronounced failure, because ionization {is highly overestimated.} Here, this shortcoming is corrected by developing a strong field model in which the many-body environment is represented by a heat bath. Our model reveals that ionization enhancement and suppression by several orders of magnitude are still possible, however only in more extreme parameter regimes. Our approach allows the integration of many-body physics into intense laser dynamics with minimal computational and mathematical complexity, thus facilitating the identification of novel effects in strong-field physics and attosecond {science}.</description>

      <title>Gapping the spin-nodal planes of an anisotropic p-wave magnet to induce a large anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets with spin splitting in the electronic structure are desired for novel spintronic phenomena in materials with nearly zero net magnetization. One of the simplest spin-split antiferromagnetic states, the $p$-wave magnet, is proposed as a result of collective instability of electron gases. Following a more recent theoretical proposal without strong electron correlations, we here report a material with the symmetry constraints for $p$-wave magnetism of conduction electrons in momentum space, based on a texture of magnetic moments in direct space. Our resonant X-ray scattering reveals coplanar, lattice-locked antiferromagnetism that satisfies the required conditions for a $p$-wave magnet: it breaks space inversion, but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a positional shift in direct space. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the electric conductivity is characteristically anisotropic in this $p$-wave magnet. In conducting magnets, the coupling of magnetic spins and freely moving electrons favors small distortions of the $p$-wave state, slightly breaking the $T$ symmetry and inducing a tiny net magnetization. In our material, this gentle symmetry breaking induces an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with a giant anomalous Hall conductivity for a bulk antiferromagnet, $\sigma_{xy}&gt;600\,$S/cm (Hall angle $&gt;3\,\%$). The $p$-wave magnet has characteristic spin-nodal planes, and such a giant AHE can be attributed to hybridization of electron bands around these nodal regions due to $T$ breaking.</description>

      <title>Ising Hamiltonian Minimization: Gain-Based Computing with Manifold Reduction of Soft-Spins vs Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the minimization of Ising Hamiltonians, comparing the performance of gain-based computing paradigms based on the dynamics of semi-classical soft-spin models with quantum annealing. We systematically analyze how the energy landscape for the circulant couplings of a Mobius graph evolves with increased annealing parameters. Our findings indicate that these semi-classical models face challenges due to a widening dimensionality landscape. To counteract this issue, we introduce the `manifold reduction' method, which restricts the soft-spin amplitudes to a defined phase space region. Concurrently, quantum annealing demonstrates a natural capability to navigate the Ising Hamiltonian's energy landscape due to its operation within the comprehensive Hilbert space. Our study indicates that physics-inspired or physics-enhanced optimizers will likely benefit from combining classical and quantum annealing techniques.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Polar Metallic phase in Ultra-Thin Epitaxially-Strained RuO2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism refers to a wide class of magnetic orders featuring magnetic sublattices with opposite spins related by rotational symmetries, resulting in non-trivial spin splitting and magnetic multipoles. However, the direct observation of the altermagnetic order parameter remains elusive. Here, by combining theoretical analysis, electrical transport, X-ray and optical spectroscopies, we establish a phase diagram in hybrid molecular beam epitaxy-grown RuO2/TiO2 (110) films, mapping symmetries along with altermagnetic/electronic/structural phase transitions as functions of film thickness and temperature. This features a novel altermagnetic metallic polar phase in epitaxially-strained 2 nm films, extending the concept of multiferroicity to altermagnets. Such a clear signature of a magnetic phase transition at ~500 K is observed exclusively in ultrathin strained films, unlike in bulk RuO2 single crystals. These results demonstrate the potential of epitaxial heterostructure design to induce altermagnetism, paving the way for emergent novel phases with multifunctional properties.</description>

      <title>Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Crossing Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered non-integrable model.</description>
