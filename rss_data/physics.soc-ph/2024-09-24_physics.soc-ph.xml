      <title>Interplay of Reward and Size of Groups in the Optional Public Goods Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Optional Public Goods Game is a three-strategy game in which an individual can play as a cooperator or defector or decide not to participate. Despite its simplicity, this model can effectively represent many human social dilemmas, such as those found in the use of public services, environmental concerns, or other activities related to society. In this contribution, we present a comprehensive analysis of the conditions under which spontaneous, sustained cooperation emerges and the characteristics of these cooperative states. Through simulations, we demonstrate the conditions leading to the coexistence of the three strategies in a steady equilibrium or the alternate dominance of each strategy in a rock-paper-scissors fashion. The results identify each of the possible scenarios in terms of two key parameters: the multiplication rate of the public good game (reward) and the size of the group of potential players. We also discuss other details of the game that may influence the appearance of cycles, along with relevant characteristics of these cycles, such as the prevalence of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Unbiased third-party bots lead to a tradeoff between cooperation and social payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities to influence cooperative dynamics with greater applicability and control. In this paper, we examine the impact of third-party bots--agents that do not directly participate in games but unbiasedly modify the payoffs of normal players engaged in prisoner's dilemma interactions--on the emergence of cooperation. Using an evolutionary simulation model, we demonstrate that unbiased bots are unable to shift the defective equilibrium among normal players in well-mixed populations. However, in structured populations, despite their unbiased actions, the bots spontaneously generate distinct impacts on cooperators and defectors, leading to enhanced cooperation. Notably, bots that apply negative influences are more effective at promoting cooperation than those applying positive ones, as fewer bots are needed to catalyze cooperative behavior among normal players. However, as the number of bots increases, a trade-off emerges: while cooperation is maintained, overall social payoffs decline. These findings highlight the need for careful management of AI's role in social systems, as even well-intentioned bots can have unintended consequences on collective outcomes.</description>

      <title>Promoting collective intelligence: The advantage of temporal star-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System structures play an essential role in the emergence of collective intelligence in many natural and engineering systems. In empirical systems, interactions among multiple agents may change over time, forming a temporal network structure, where nodes represent the system's components and links capture who interacts with whom. Recent studies report that temporal networks are more conducive to the emergence of collective cooperation compared to their aggregated static structures. However, the question of which kind of structural characteristics of temporal networks promote collective cooperation still remains elusive. Here we systematically investigate the evolution of cooperation on temporal networks with diverse structural characteristics, such as random, star, and cluster structures. We uncover that temporal networks with single-star structures which lack network clusters are more conducive to collective cooperation than other structures. This counterintuitive result cautions against the common belief that network clusters normally facilitate collective cooperation, revealing the unique advantages of temporal networks over static networks. We further propose an index to quantify the capacity of structural characteristics of temporal networks in promoting collective cooperation. Our findings pave the way for designing the optimal structure of temporal networks to favour collective cooperation.</description>

      <title>Critical Node Detection in Temporal Social Networks, Based on Global and Semi-local Centrality Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodes that play strategic roles in networks are called critical or influential nodes. For example, in an epidemic, we can control the infection spread by isolating critical nodes; in marketing, we can use certain nodes as the initial spreaders aiming to reach the largest part of the network, or they can be selected for removal in targeted attacks to maximise the fragmentation of the network. In this study, we focus on critical node detection in temporal networks. We propose three new measures to identify the critical nodes in temporal networks: the temporal supracycle ratio, temporal semi-local integration, and temporal semi-local centrality. We analyse the performance of these measures based on their effect on the SIR epidemic model in three scenarios: isolating the influential nodes when an epidemic happens, using the influential nodes as seeds of the epidemic, or removing them to analyse the robustness of the network. We compare the results with existing centrality measures, particularly temporal betweenness, temporal centrality, and temporal degree deviation. The results show that the introduced measures help identify influential nodes more accurately. The proposed methods can be used to detect nodes that need to be isolated to reduce the spread of an epidemic or as initial nodes to speedup dissemination of information.</description>

      <title>Bounded-confidence opinion models with random-time interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In models of opinion dynamics, the opinions of individual agents evolve with time. One type of opinion model is a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents compromise their opinions with each other if those opinions are sufficiently similar. In studies of BCMs, it is typically assumed that interactions between agents occur at deterministic times. This assumption neglects an inherent element of randomness in social systems. In this paper, we study BCMs on networks and allow agents to interact at random times. To incorporate random-time interactions, we use renewal processes to determine social interactions, which can follow arbitrary waiting-time distributions (WTDs). We establish connections between these random-time-interaction BCMs and deterministic-time-interaction BCMs. We find that BCMs with Markovian WTDs have consistent statistical properties on different networks but that the statistical properties of BCMs with non-Markovian WTDs depend on network structure.</description>

      <title>Language agents achieve superhuman synthesis of scientific knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models are known to produce incorrect information, and their accuracy and reliability for scientific research are still in question. We developed a detailed human-AI comparison method to evaluate language models on real-world literature search tasks, including information retrieval, summarization, and contradiction detection. Our findings show that PaperQA2, an advanced language model focused on improving factual accuracy, matches or outperforms subject matter experts on three realistic literature search tasks, with no restrictions on human participants (full internet access, search tools, and time). PaperQA2 generates cited, Wikipedia-style summaries of scientific topics that are significantly more accurate than current human-written Wikipedia entries. We also present LitQA2, a new benchmark for scientific literature research, which shaped the development of PaperQA2 and contributed to its superior performance. Additionally, PaperQA2 identifies contradictions in scientific literature, a challenging task for humans. It finds an average of 2.34 +/- 1.99 contradictions per paper in a random sample of biology papers, with 70% of these contradictions validated by human experts. These results show that language models can now surpass domain experts in important scientific literature tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Basede on a study of the modern presidencial democracies in South America, we present a statistical mechanics exploration of the collective, coordinated action of political actors in the legislative chamber that may result on the impeachment of the executive. By representing the legislative political actors with neurla networks, we observed that the larger the effective number of presidential-agenda items are treated, the smaller the chances for a cross-party dialogue, which, if combined with a decrement in the president's public approval rating, could trigger an impeachment process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy justice, at the intersection of energy and societal ethics, studies the origins, quantification, and resolution of persistent and potential inequities within the energy sector, serving as a foundational pillar for societal harmony. In this review, we overview the historical and modern definitions of energy equity and frameworks of energy justice. We highlight the tools adopted to measure equity in the energy context, unveiling multifaceted inequities that permeate global energy landscapes. We discuss the limitations of prevalent metrics such as the Gini coefficient and Generalized Entropy Indices in the evaluation of energy justice concerns. Finally, we analyze publications that examined current practices and proposed improving methods towards a more equitable energy market for the society from policy, planning, and operation perspectives.</description>

      <title>Opinion response functions are key to understanding tipping of social conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extent to which committed minorities can overturn social conventions is an active area of research in the mathematical modelling of opinion dynamics. Researchers generally use simulations of agent-based models (ABMs) to compute approximate values for the minimum committed minority size needed to overturn a social convention. In this manuscript, we expand on previous work by studying an ABM's mean-field behaviour using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and a new tool, opinion response functions. Using these methods allows for formal analysis of the deterministic model which can provide a theoretical explanation for observed behaviours, e.g., coexistence or overturning of opinions. In particular, opinion response functions are a method of characterizing the equilibria in our social model. Our analysis confirms earlier numerical results and supplements them with a precise formula for computing the minimum committed minority size required to overturn a social convention.</description>

      <title>Memory and Personality Shape Ideological Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We do experiments on physical agents with dynamic binary ideologies, deep memories of previous probes of neigboring agents, but fixed personalities that interpret the memory content to make ideological decisions. We find experimentally a critical memory depth below which complete ideological polarization of the collective cannot occur, and above which it is inevitable, an emergent symmetry breaking that is memory depth dependent. Depending on the details of the personalities, the polarization can be static or dynamic in time, even in certain cases chaotic due to nonreciprocity in how the agents respond to other agents. Thus, agents with different personalities and depths of memory serve as a physics analog of the ideology dynamics among biased individuals, illuminating how decisions influenced by individual memories of past interactions can shape and influence subsequent polarization. Perhaps such applications of physics-based systems to political systems will help us to understand the ideological instabilities observed today.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry underlies stability in power grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavioral homogeneity is often critical for the functioning of network systems of interacting entities. In power grids, whose stable operation requires generator frequencies to be synchronized--and thus homogeneous--across the network, previous work suggests that the stability of synchronous states can be improved by making the generators homogeneous. Here, we show that a substantial additional improvement is possible by instead making the generators suitably heterogeneous. We develop a general method for attributing this counterintuitive effect to converse symmetry breaking, a recently established phenomenon in which the system must be asymmetric to maintain a stable symmetric state. These findings constitute the first demonstration of converse symmetry breaking in real-world systems, and our method promises to enable identification of this phenomenon in other networks whose functions rely on behavioral homogeneity.</description>

      <title>The myth of declining competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces six alternative indices for measuring ex ante and ex post competitive balance in order to explore the robustness of these results. The ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, while the ex post measures compare the group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. We find no evidence of any trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>

      <title>Predictability maximization and the origins of word order harmony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16570v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.</description>
