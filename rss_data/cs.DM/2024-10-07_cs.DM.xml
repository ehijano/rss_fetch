      <title>A survey of Zarankiewicz problem in geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the central topics in extremal graph theory is the study of the function $ex(n,H)$, which represents the maximum number of edges a graph with $n$ vertices can have while avoiding a fixed graph $H$ as a subgraph. Tur{\'a}n provided a complete characterization for the case when $H$ is a complete graph on $r$ vertices. Erd{\H o}s, Stone, and Simonovits extended Tur{\'a}n's result to arbitrary graphs $H$ with $\chi(H) &gt; 2$ (chromatic number greater than 2). However, determining the asymptotics of $ex(n, H)$ for bipartite graphs $H$ remains a widely open problem. A classical example of this is Zarankiewicz's problem, which asks for the asymptotics of $ex(n, K_{t,t})$. In this paper, we survey Zarankiewicz's problem, with a focus on graphs that arise from geometry. Incidence geometry, in particular, can be viewed as a manifestation of Zarankiewicz's problem in geometrically defined graphs.</description>

      <title>Non-conflicting no-where zero $Z_2\times Z_2$ flows in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Z_2\times Z_2=\{0, \alpha, \beta, \alpha+\beta\}$. If $G$ is a bridgeless cubic graph, $F$ is a perfect matching of $G$ and $\overline{F}$ is the complementary 2-factor of $F$, then a no-where zero $Z_2\times Z_2$-flow $\theta$ of $G/\overline{F}$ is called non-conflicting with respect to $\overline{F}$, if $\overline{F}$ contains no edge $e=uv$, such that $u$ is incident to an edge with $\theta$-value $\alpha$ and $v$ is incident to an edge with $\theta$-value $\beta$. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of non-conflicting flows by showing that if a cubic graph $G$ admits such a flow with respect to some perfect matching $F$, then $G$ admits a normal 6-edge-coloring. We use this observation in order to show that claw-free bridgeless cubic graphs, bridgeless cubic graphs possessing a 2-factor having at most two cycles admit a normal 6-edge-coloring. We demonstrate the usefulness of non-conflicting flows further by relating them to a recent conjecture of Thomassen about edge-disjoint perfect matchings in highly connected regular graphs. In the end of the paper, we construct infinitely many 2-edge-connected cubic graphs such that $G/\overline{F}$ does not admit a non-conflicting no-where zero $Z_2\times Z_2$-flow with respect to any perfect matching $F$.</description>

      <title>Spanning disks in triangulations of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a triangulation $G$ of a surface $\mathbb{D}$, a spanning disk is a disk $\mathbb{D} \subseteq \mathbb{S}$ containing all the vertices of $G$ such that the boundary of $\mathbb{D}$ is a cycle of $G$. In this paper, we consider the question of when a triangulation of a surface contains a spanning disk. We give a very short proof that every triangulation of the torus contains a spanning disk, which strengthens a theorem of Nevo and Tarabykin. For arbitrary surfaces, we prove that triangulations with sufficiently high facewidth always contain spanning disks. Finally, we exhibit triangulations which do not have spanning disks. This shows that a minimum facewidth condition is necessary. Our results are motivated by and have applications for rigidity questions in the plane.</description>

      <title>Forbidden induced subgraphs in iterative higher order line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple finite connected graph. The line graph $L(G)$ of graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the edges of $G$, where $ef \in E(L(G))$ when $e \cap f \neq \emptyset$. Iteratively, the higher order line graphs are defined inductively as $L^1(G) = L(G)$ and $L^n(G) = L(L^{n-1}(G))$ for $n \geq 2$. In [Derived graphs and digraphs, Beitrage zur Graphentheorie (Teubner, Leipzig 1968), 17--33 (1968)], Beineke characterize line graphs in terms of nine forbidden subgraphs. Inspired by this result, in this paper, we characterize second order line graphs in terms of pure forbidden induced subgraphs. We also give a sufficient list of forbidden subgraphs for a graph $G$ such that $G$ is a higher order line graph. We characterize all order line graphs of graph $G$ with $\Delta(G) = 3$ and $4$.</description>

      <title>Complexity results for a cops and robber game on directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cops and robber game on directed graphs, where the robber moves along the arcs of the graph, while the cops can select any position at each time step. Our main focus is on the cop number: the minimum number of cops required to guarantee the capture of the robber. We prove that deciding whether the cop number of a digraph is equal to 1 is NP-hard, whereas this is decidable in polynomial time for tournaments. Furthermore, we show that computing the cop number for general digraphs is fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by a generalization of vertex cover. However, for tournaments, tractability is achieved with respect to the minimum size of a feedback vertex set. Among our findings, we prove that the cop number of a digraph is equal to that of its reverse digraph, and we draw connections to the matrix mortality problem.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Polyhedra of Piecewise Linear Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we contribute to the frequently studied question of how to decompose a continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function into a difference of two convex CPWL functions. Every CPWL function has infinitely many such decompositions, but for applications in optimization and neural network theory, it is crucial to find decompositions with as few linear pieces as possible. This is a highly challenging problem, as we further demonstrate by disproving a recently proposed approach by Tran and Wang [Minimal representations of tropical rational functions. Algebraic Statistics, 15(1):27-59, 2024]. To make the problem more tractable, we propose to fix an underlying polyhedral complex determining the possible locus of nonlinearity. Under this assumption, we prove that the set of decompositions forms a polyhedron that arises as intersection of two translated cones. We prove that irreducible decompositions correspond to the bounded faces of this polyhedron and minimal solutions must be vertices. We then identify cases with a unique minimal decomposition, and illustrate how our insights have consequences in the theory of submodular functions. Finally, we improve upon previous constructions of neural networks for a given convex CPWL function and apply our framework to obtain results in the nonconvex case.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Steady Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the formation of the grand coalition of a cooperative game by investigating its possible internal dynamics. Each coalition is capable of forcing all players to reconsider the current state of the game when it does not provide sufficient payoff. Different coalitions may ask for contradictory evolutions, leading to the impossibility of the grand coalition forming. In this paper, we give a characterization of the impossibility, for a given state, of finding a new state dominating the previous one such that each aggrieved coalition has a satisfactory payoff. To do so, we develop new polyhedral tools related to a new family of polyhedra, appearing in numerous situations in cooperative game theory.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by colouring minimal Cayley graphs, in 1978, Babai conjectured that no-lonely-colour graphs have bounded chromatic number. We disprove this in a strong sense by constructing graphs of arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number that have a proper edge-colouring in which each cycle contains no colour exactly once.</description>

      <title>Space-time deterministic graph rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-terminating graph rewriting models, whose local rules are applied non-deterministically -- and yet enjoy a strong form of determinism, namely space-time determinism. Of course in the case of terminating computation it is well-known that the mess introduced by asynchronous rule applications may not matter to the end result, as confluence conspires to produce a unique normal form. In the context of non-terminating computation however, confluence is a very weak property, and (almost) synchronous rule applications is always preferred e.g. when it comes to simulating dynamical systems. Here we provide sufficient conditions so that asynchronous local rule applications conspire to produce well-determined events in the space-time unfolding of the graph, regardless of their application orders. Our first example is an asynchronous simulation of a dynamical system. Our second example features time dilation, in the spirit of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Dataless Quadratic Neural Networks for the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) addresses many important problems, including the challenging Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Alongside exact and heuristic solvers, differentiable approaches have emerged, often using continuous relaxations of ReLU-based or quadratic objectives. Noting that an MIS in a graph is a Maximum Clique (MC) in its complement, we propose a new quadratic formulation for MIS by incorporating an MC term, improving convergence and exploration. We show that every maximal independent set corresponds to a local minimizer, derive conditions for the MIS size, and characterize stationary points. To solve our non-convex objective, we propose solving parallel multiple initializations using momentum-based gradient descent, complemented by an efficient MIS checking criterion derived from our theory. Therefore, we dub our method as parallelized Clique-Informed Quadratic Optimization for MIS (pCQO-MIS). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to exact, heuristic, sampling, and data-centric approaches. Notably, our method avoids the out-of-distribution tuning and reliance on (un)labeled data required by data-centric methods, while achieving superior MIS sizes and competitive runtime relative to their inference time. Additionally, a key advantage of pCQO-MIS is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the runtime scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges.</description>

Abstract: A $2$-distance $k$-coloring of a graph is a proper vertex $k$-coloring where vertices at distance at most 2 cannot share the same color. We prove the existence of a $2$-distance $4$-coloring for planar subcubic graphs with girth at least 21. We also show a construction of a planar subcubic graph of girth 11 that is not $2$-distance $4$-colorable.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Depth in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A characterization of the representability of neural networks is relevant to comprehend their success in artificial intelligence. This study investigate two topics on ReLU neural network expressivity and their connection with a conjecture related to the minimum depth required for representing any continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function. The topics are the minimal depth representation of the sum and max operations, as well as the exploration of polytope neural networks. For the sum operation, we establish a sufficient condition on the minimal depth of the operands to find the minimal depth of the operation. In contrast, regarding the max operation, a comprehensive set of examples is presented, demonstrating that no sufficient conditions, depending solely on the depth of the operands, would imply a minimal depth for the operation. The study also examine the minimal depth relationship between convex CPWL functions. On polytope neural networks, we investigate basic depth properties from Minkowski sums, convex hulls, number of vertices, faces, affine transformations, and indecomposable polytopes. More significant findings include depth characterization of polygons; identification of polytopes with an increasing number of vertices, exhibiting small depth and others with arbitrary large depth; and most notably, the minimal depth of simplices, which is strictly related to the minimal depth conjecture in ReLU networks.</description>
