      <title>The 2027-2034 Vision for Nuclear Physics in Canada, with an outlook to 2041</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Canadian subatomic physics community establishes its scientific, and thus funding, priorities through periodic Long-Range Plans (LRP). The community is now putting together a new LRP, which will be in effect from 2027 through 2034, with its scope extending through 2041. As part of this process, the Canadian Institute of Nuclear Physics (CINP) has put together a strategic report, following an extensive consultation process. The report describes the broad and ambitious research program undertaken by the Canadian nuclear physics research community, both onshore and abroad, touching on key questions regarding the origin, evolution, and structure of visible matter in the universe. This document provides a grid of different Canadian nuclear physics projects undertaken now and in the future, and their associated timelines. It concludes with specific recommendations for maximizing Canadian scientific output in nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>First measurement of the strong interaction scattering parameters for the $\mathbf{K^-d}$ and $\mathbf{K^+d}$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged kaon--deuteron interactions offer a sensitive probe of the strangeness sector of QCD at low energy, particularly through their scattering parameters. Despite available theoretical predictions, experimental constraints remain absent, particularly for the $\rm K^{-}d$ system. The first measurement of femtoscopic correlation functions for $\rm K^{-}d \oplus K^{+}\overline{d}$ and $\rm K^{+}d \oplus K^{-}\overline{d}$ particle pairs in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV recorded by ALICE at the LHC is presented. Correlation functions for both systems are analyzed in three centrality classes and fitted using the Lednick\'y--Lyuboshitz model to extract the source size and strong interaction scattering lengths. The $\rm K^{-}d$ scattering length is found to be $\Re f_0 = -1.44 \pm 0.15\text{ (stat.)}^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$ (syst.) fm and $\Im f_0 = 1.34 \pm 0.33$ (stat.)$^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$ (syst.) fm, while for $\rm K^{+}d$ the value $\Re f_0 = -0.68 \pm 0.16$ (stat.)$^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$ (syst.) fm is obtained. These results provide the first constraints on the $\rm K^{\pm} d$ interaction modeling at low energy, delivering a long-awaited experimental benchmark for testing chiral QCD dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\pi^0$-hadron correlations relative to the event plane in semicentral Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Per-trigger yields of $\pi^0$-hadron correlations were measured in semicentral Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV in ALICE at the LHC. The reconstructed $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$, with a transverse momentum of $11 &lt; p_{\rm T}(\pi^0) &lt; 14$ GeV/$c$, is used as the trigger particle to calculate yields of associated charged particles on the near- and away-side. The photons are reconstructed using the ALICE Electromagnetic Calorimeter, and the charged particles are measured in the ALICE central barrel within a pseudorapidity range of $|\eta|&lt;0.8$. The yields are reported relative to the orientation of the $\pi^0$ with the $2^{\rm nd}$-order event plane, and are background subtracted using the reaction plane fit method. The data give an indication of a suppression of the associated charged-particle yields near $p_{\rm T} \approx 2$ GeV/$c$ when comparing out-of-plane to in-plane trigger particles. At associated charged-particle $p_{\rm T} &gt; 3$ GeV/$c$, no significant event-plane dependence is observed within uncertainties. The results are compared with predictions from the JEWEL model, which implements jet energy loss in an expanding medium. JEWEL predicts no significant modification of either the near- or away-side associated yields, independent of whether medium recoils are included. The observed behavior may indicate the presence of additional energy-loss mechanisms beyond those governed by path-length dependence.</description>

      <title>Deuteron coalescence probability in jets in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the first measurement of the (anti)deuteron and antiproton transverse-momentum distributions, the deuteron coalescence parameter, and the ratio between the yields of deuteron and proton in and out of jets in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Three regions are used to study the jet-correlated production: Toward, Away, and Transverse to the jet axis, which direction is approximated by the leading particle in the event with $p_{\rm T}^{\rm lead} &gt; 5$ GeV/$c$. The jet contribution is obtained from the Toward region by subtracting the underlying event, which dominates the Transverse region. In p-Pb collisions, an enhancement of the coalescence parameter $B_{\rm 2}$ is observed in jets compared to the underlying event. The enhancement is larger than the one observed in a similar analysis already in pp collisions. The results are compared with predictions from PYTHIA 8.314 using the Angantyr model with a deuteron production model based on ordinary nuclear reactions. The model is able to qualitatively reproduce the large enhancement of the coalescence parameter in jets with respect to the out-of-jets one. The results are further compared in detail with similar ones from previous studies for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Limits on the chiral magnetic effect from the event shape engineering and participant-spectator correlation techniques in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest experimental studies related to the search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV recorded with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented. Charge-dependent two-particle correlations relative to the reaction plane are measured for charged particles in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$ and the transverse-momentum range $0.2 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 5$ GeV/$c$. Two approaches have been employed: in the first method, the contribution of the background to the measurement is varied using the event shape engineering (ESE), while the second relies on changing the contribution of the potential CME signal by measuring azimuthal correlations relative to the participant plane, where the background contributions are maximized, and spectator plane, where the CME signal contribution is maximized. Both methods yield results consistent with the absence of a CME signal within the measurement uncertainties. The result obtained from correlations relative to different symmetry planes, a technique applied for the first time at LHC energies, gives the possibility to test independently and confirm the upper limits from previous measurements, while the new limit from the ESE analysis offers improved constraint relative to previous attempts.</description>

      <title>Flavorful Lepton Number Violation at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of detecting flavorful lepton number violation at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) through resonant production of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), resulting in $e^- p \to \ell^+_\alpha + k\, j+X$, where $\alpha \in \{e, \mu, \tau \}$ and $k$ denotes the number of jets. We work in the $\nu$SMEFT framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory augmented with $n$ singlet HNLs, one of which is in the mass range $10-100$~GeV, within kinematic reach of the EIC. To explore the EIC sensitivity, we focus on the HNL production mechanism induced by mixing with light neutrinos. We study kinematic distributions for signal and backgrounds, including hadronization and detector effects, and suggest a set of cuts to minimize backgrounds. In the mass range considered, we find that the EIC with muon detection capabilities and an integrated luminosity of $100~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ can reach sensitivities comparable to the strongest direct (LHC) and indirect constraints, and is especially relevant in the $\nu$SMEFT framework beyond dimension four. Our study motivates further assessment of muon detection capabilities at the EIC and $\tau$ hadronic reconstruction, as well as a more general theoretical analysis involving production mechanisms mediated by higher-dimensional operators in the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Impact of Geometric Inflation on Nucleon Size Sensitivity in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic transverse size of nucleons, parameterized by a Gaussian width $w$, is a critical yet uncertain input in the initial-state modeling of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using a finite $w$ in standard initial geometry models introduces an unintentional ``geometric inflation'' that alters the initial nuclear density profile. In this study, we implement a self-consistent density correction to eliminate this artifact and investigate its impact on final-state observables. Through hybrid (viscous hydrodynamics + hadronic transport) simulations of $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb collisions at the LHC, we demonstrate that removing geometric inflation significantly modifies the sensitivity of observables to the nucleon width $w$. While elliptic flow and mean transverse momentum ($\langle [p_{\rm T}]\rangle$) become less sensitive to variations in $w$, the Pearson correlation coefficient $\rho(v_{n}^{2}, \delta p_{\rm T})$, $[p_{\rm T}]$ fluctuations, and triangular flow exhibit enhanced sensitivity to fluctuations in nucleon positions. Our results indicate that uncorrected geometric inflation can bias the extraction of nucleon structure and quark-gluon plasma properties. This underscores the necessity of a self-consistent initial-state geometry for reliable Bayesian inference in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Towards a microscopic description of 12C+12C fusion at stellar energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a fully microscopic description of the 12C+12C fusion reaction at stellar energies. Utilizing the multichannel Resonating Group Method (RGM), my model explicitly includes 12C+12C and alpha+20Ne reaction channels (with excited states). This approach provides a consistent, simultaneous, description of fusion, elastic scattering, and 24Mg spectroscopy. Results for 12C+12C elastic scattering show excellent agreement with experimental data, significantly improving the single-channel approximations. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that 24Mg states and resonances are highly mixed configurations, contradicting the concept of pure "molecular states." The calculated fusion S-factor is consistent with available experimental data and predicts both narrow and broad resonances near the Coulomb barrier. Main resonance widths originate primarily from the alpha+20Ne exit channels. The S-factor exhibits a decrease at low energies, providing a microscopic support for the hypothesis of fusion hindrance. This work is a first step towards a reliable theoretical extrapolation of the 12C+12C reaction to deep stellar burning temperatures. Future works should include the neutron and proton channels to provide a complete description of the 12C+12C fusion.</description>

      <title>Inclusive $\psi(2S)$ production at midrapidity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inclusive production of $\psi(2S)$ mesons is measured for the first time at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.9$) in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV using the ALICE detector at the LHC. The measurement is performed in the transverse-momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) range of 4 to 16 GeV/$c$ and is based on events triggered by the Transition Radiation Detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $1.7 \pm 1.8\%$ (syst.) pb$^{-1}$. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross section of the $\psi(2S)$ and its ratio to the J/$\psi$ production cross section are presented. The results extend the accessible $p_{\rm T}$ range down to 4 GeV/$c$, and a mild rise of the $\psi(2S)$-to-J/$\psi$ cross section ratio with increasing $p_{\rm T}$ is observed. The measurements are compared with theoretical predictions based on NRQCD and the ICEM model.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the charged-particle-jet transverse-momentum fraction carried by prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ mesons in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of the transverse-momentum fraction ($z^{\rm ch}$) carried by prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ in charged-particle jets in proton--proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV is reported by the ALICE Collaboration at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The measurement is based on a Transition Radiation Detector triggered data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L} = 1.63\pm0.03$ pb$^{-1}$. Inclusive J/$\psi$ mesons with transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) above 1 GeV/$c$ are reconstructed at midrapidity through the electron--positron decay channel. The prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ contributions are separated using the secondary vertices from beauty-hadron decays. Jets are reconstructed from J/$\psi$-meson candidates and charged particles using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm with jet resolution parameter $R = 0.4$ in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta_{\text{jet}}| &lt; 0.5$. The distribution of the charged-particle jet $p_{\rm T}$ fraction carried by the prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ mesons, $z^{\rm ch}$, is measured in the range $0.3 &lt; z^{\rm ch} \leq 1.0$ for the jet-$ p_{\rm T}$ range $7 &lt; p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet} &lt; 15$ GeV/$c$. The measured $z^{\rm ch}$ distributions for prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ are compared to pQCD calculations and PYTHIA 8 simulations. Prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ production within charged-particle jets are found to be qualitatively well reproduced by PYTHIA 8 for $z^{\rm ch}&lt;0.9$, however, as $z^{\rm ch}$ approaches one, the simulations overshoot the measured data, indicating an overestimation of the fraction of isolated J/$\psi$. This observed tension between data and simulations in the highest $z^{\rm ch}$ bins reflects the challenge of simulating hadronization of low-momentum jets.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the production of W$^{\pm}$ and Z$^0$ bosons in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the production of the W$^{\pm}$ and Z$^0$ bosons at midrapidity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with ALICE at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented. The W$^{\pm}$ and Z$^0$ bosons are detected via their (di)electronic decay channels, with the electron reconstruction performed in the midrapidity region ($|y|&lt; 0.6$). The $p_{\rm T}$-integrated and $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross sections of electrons from W$^{\pm}$ decays in the interval $30 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 60$ GeV/$c$, as well as the $p_{\rm T}$-integrated production cross section of Z$^0$ bosons, are measured. The results are described by perturbative QCD calculations using different sets of parton distribution functions. The production of W$^{\pm}$ bosons and azimuthally correlated associated hadrons is also measured as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity for the first time at the LHC. The former increases approximately linearly with the charged-particle multiplicity, while for the latter, there are hints of a faster-than-linear increase. These observations are compared with theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Understanding the impact of nuclear effects on proton decay searches with the GiBUU model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton decay searches in the next generation of water Cherenkov detectors, such as Hyper-Kamiokande, are expected to probe the $10^{35}$-year lifetime regime where atmospheric neutrino backgrounds and systematic uncertainties begin to play an increasingly important role. In this study, we employ the GiBUU framework and reevaluate the proton decay search sensitivity for the $\textrm{p}\rightarrow\textrm{e}^{+}\pi^{0}$ channel by incorporating a typical event reconstruction performance in water Cherenkov detectors. Using sophisticated models implemented in GiBUU -- most notably the mean-field potential and Boltzmann transport -- which have been benchmarked against accelerator neutrino scattering data, in particular pion production, we find that the resulting proton decay signal detection efficiency and atmospheric neutrino background rate are comparable to those previously evaluated for the current and near future water Cherenkov experiments using $\textit{ad hoc}$ nuclear models. In addition to pion final-state interactions, we evaluate the impact of differences in the Fermi momentum distribution of nucleons in the nucleus, as a source of systematic uncertainty, on the signal detection efficiency and the expected background event rate. We find that the uncertainty associated with pion final-state interactions is moderate, whereas the choice of Fermi momentum distribution can significantly affect the estimated atmospheric neutrino background rate and constitutes the dominant contribution. Our study provides an independent and complementary characterisation of nuclear effects on proton decay searches and helps to refine sensitivity estimates in the regime where systematic uncertainties become more relevant.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal finite-volume effects in the vicinity of chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we discuss the finite-size scaling analysis of the order parameter related to the chiral phase transition in QCD with two massless quarks. We use data obtained in lattice QCD calculations performed with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) for a range of light quark masses, $1/240 \leq m_\ell/m_s \leq 1/27$ for different spatial volumes ($N_\sigma$) on Euclidean lattices with temporal extent $N_\tau=8$, satisfying $3\,N_\tau \leq N_\sigma \leq 10\,N_\tau$. We observe that infinite volume extrapolated data for the order parameter agree reasonably well with the expected $O(2)$ scaling behavior even for physical ratios of the light-to-strange quark mass ratio. We quantify deviations from asymptotic scaling and perform a detailed analysis of the influence of finite-size effects in terms of temperature and quark masses at a fixed lattice cutoff. This is crucial for improving the reliability of the infinite-volume extrapolated estimate of the chiral order parameter and for a more precise determination of chiral phase transition temperature from direct Lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Initial results of the TRIUMF ultracold advanced neutron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first results on ultracold neutron production from a new spallation-driven superfluid $^4$He (He-II) source at TRIUMF, which is being prepared for a new, precise measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment. A total of $(9.3 \pm 0.8)\times 10^{5}$ ultracold neutrons were observed at a proton beam current of \SI{37}{\uA}, when the target was irradiated for a period of \SI{60}{\s}. The results are in fair agreement with expectations based on a detailed simulation of neutron transport and ultracold neutron source cryogenics. There is some indication that the new source might not be as limited by the conduction of heat through the He-II as originally expected. The results indicate that the source is likely to make its ultimate production goals, once the liquid deuterium cold moderator system is completed, with the expectation that $5.7\times 10^7$~UCNs would be detected in the same experiment with full liquid levels. This would, for example, correspond to delivery of $1.4\times 10^6$~UCNs delivered to each of two nEDM measurement cells, and a statistical uncertainty of $1\times 10^{-27}~e$cm on the neutron EDM in 280 days of running.</description>

      <title>System-size dependence of charged-particle suppression in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy partons lose energy while propagating through the hot, strongly interacting medium produced in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, leading to a suppression of particle production at high transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$). The dependence of this energy loss on the size of the colliding nuclear system has yet to be firmly established experimentally. This Letter presents a systematic study of charged-particle suppression across four different nucleus-nucleus collision systems using nuclear modification factors ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) measured by the CMS Collaboration at the CERN LHC. Previous CMS measurements of $R_\mathrm{AA}$ in oxygen-oxygen, xenon-xenon, and lead-lead collisions are recast with identical $p_\mathrm{T}$ intervals and are complemented by the first measurement of the charged-particle $R_\mathrm{AA}$ in neon-neon collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV. The neon-neon data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 0.76 nb$^{-1}$. The $R_\mathrm{AA}$ in all collision systems examined show similar qualitative trends, but have a magnitude which is ordered with the nucleon number A. The $R_\mathrm{AA}$ feature a downward slope at low $p_\mathrm{T}$, a local minimum at around 5$-$7 GeV, and an upward slope with increasing $p_\mathrm{T}$. The $R_\mathrm{AA}$ are also compared in terms of A$^{1/3}$, which is proportional to the nuclear radius. Models including only initial-state nuclear effects fail to reproduce the observed trends, whereas energy loss models reproduce the trends in the region $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\gt$ 9.6 GeV.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of the reaction $\Xi^{0}n\rightarrow\Lambda\Lambda X$ using $\Xi^{0}$-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using $(10087\pm44)\times10^{6}$$J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring in $2009$, $2012$, $2018$, and $2019$, we perform a search for the reaction $\Xi^0n\rightarrow\Lambda\Lambda X$, where $X$ denotes any additional final particles. Given the highly suppressed phase space for producing extra pions, the $X$ consists of either nothing or a photon, corresponding to the processes $\Xi^0 n \rightarrow \Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi^{0}n\rightarrow\Lambda\Sigma^0\rightarrow\Lambda\Lambda\gamma$. The $\Xi^0$ comes from the decay of $J/\psi\rightarrow\Xi^0\bar{\Xi}^0$, while the neutron originates from material of the beam pipe. A signal is observed for the first time with a statistical significance of 6.4$\sigma$. The cross section for the reaction $\Xi^0+{^9\rm{Be}}\rightarrow\Lambda+\Lambda+X$ is measured to be $(43.6\pm10.5_{\text{stat}}\pm11.1_{\text{syst}})$ mb at $P_{\Xi^0}\approx0.818$ GeV/$c$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. No significant $H$-dibaryon signal is observed in the $\Lambda\Lambda$ final state.</description>

      <title>Binned and Unbinned Transverse Single Spin Asymmetry Extraction, including Background Subtraction and Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of transverse single-spin asymmetries in experiments involving polarized targets and/or beams may encounter challenges when (1) the magnitude of the polarization varies greatly with time, (2) the polarization magnitude is not the same for each spin state, (3) different integrated luminosities occur for different spin states or different target materials, and/or (4) some kinematic variables require unfolding; these are just a few examples. We present general methods of determining the asymmetry based on both binned analysis and unbinned maximum likelihood optimization, incorporating the unfolding of kinematic variables that are smeared by detector effects, and also including the possibility of background subtraction.</description>

      <title>2025 EIC-France Workshop: Physics Highlights and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document presents a synthesis of the theory contributions and discussions from the 2nd EIC-France Workshop, held at IJCLab (Orsay) on 1-3 December 2025. The workshop brought together members of the French hadron-physics community to review recent theoretical developments relevant to the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) and to coordinate national efforts in preparation for its early physics program. The report first summarizes the collider's initial running conditions and luminosity performance, as outlined in the EIC Early Science Matrix. It then provides concise overviews of the theoretical presentations on inclusive, semi-inclusive, exclusive, heavy-flavor, and small-x physics.
  Based on these discussions, two measurements emerged as especially well suited for early EIC operation and strongly aligned with areas of established French expertise: inclusive diffraction and inclusive quarkonium production. These channels offer clean signatures, robust theoretical interpretability, and direct sensitivity to fundamental QCD phenomena such as gluon saturation, heavy-quark dynamics, and the small-x structure of hadrons and nuclei.
  In addition, the workshop identified longer-term physics opportunities that will benefit from the full capabilities of the EIC after its ramp-up phase. These include accessing the three-dimensional structure of the pion through the Sullivan process and a broader program of exclusive three-body final states, both of which represent high-impact avenues for exploring hadronic structure and non-perturbative QCD. Together, the elements summarized in this report provide a coherent overview of the strategic priorities and scientific ambitions shaping the French community's contribution to the EIC physics program.</description>
