      <title>A Rotational Disruption Crisis for Zodiacal Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic torque from anisotropic radiation can rapidly spin up irregular grains to the point of breakup. We apply the standard theory of rotational disruption from radiative torques to solar system grains, finding that grains with radii $\sim$0.03 --3 $\mu$m at 1 a.u. from the Sun are spun to the point of breakup on timescales $\lesssim1$ yr even when assuming them to have an unrealistically high tensile strength of pure meteoritic iron. Such a rapid disruption timescale is incompatible with both the abundance of micron-sized grains detected in the inner solar system and with the low production rate of $\beta$ meteoroids. We suggest the possibility that zodiacal grains have a strong propensity to attain rotational equilibrium at low angular velocity (a so-called low-$J$ attractor) and that the efficacy of rotational disruption in the Solar System -- and likely elsewhere -- has been greatly overestimated.</description>

      <title>Planetesimal formation via the streaming instability in simulations of infall dominated young disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks naturally emerge during protostellar core-collapse. In their early evolutionary stages, infalling material dominates their dynamical evolution. In the context of planet formation, this means that the conditions in young disks are different from the typically considered disks where infall has subsided. High inward velocities are caused by the advection of accreted material which is deficient in angular momentum, rather than being set by viscous spreading, and accretion gives rise to strong velocity fluctuations. Therefore, we aim to investigate when it is possible for the first planetesimals to form and subsequent planet formation to commence. We analyze the disks obtained in numerical 3D nonideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations, which serve as a basis for 1D models representing the conditions during the Class 0/I evolutionary stages. We integrate the 1D models with an adapted version of the TwoPopPy code to investigate the formation of the first planetesimals via the streaming instability. In disks with temperatures such that the snow line is located at ~10 AU and where it is assumed that velocity fluctuations felt by the dust are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to the gas, ${\sim}10^{-3}M_\odot$ of planetesimals may be formed already during the first 100 kyr after disk formation, implying the possible early formation of giant planet cores. The cold-finger effect at the snow line is the dominant driver of planetesimal formation, which occurs in episodes and utilizes solids supplied directly from the envelope, leaving the disk solid reservoir intact. However, if the cold-finger effect is suppressed, early planetesimal formation is limited to cold disks with efficient dust settling whose dust-to-gas ratio is initially enriched to $\epsilon_0\geq 0.03$.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: Living on the Wedge, or, NIRCam Bar Coronagraphy Reveals CO$_2$ in the HR 8799 and 51 Eri Exoplanets' Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-contrast observations with JWST can reveal key composition and vertical mixing dependent absorption features in the spectra of directly imaged planets across the 3-5 $\mu$m wavelength range. We present novel coronagraphic images of the HR 8799 and 51 Eri planetary systems using the NIRCam Long Wavelength Bar in an offset "narrow" position. These observations have revealed the four known gas giant planets encircling HR 8799, even at spatial separations challenging for a 6.5 m telescope in the mid-infrared, including the first ever detection of HR 8799 e at 4.6 $\mu$m. The chosen filters constrain the strength of CO, CH4, and CO2 absorption in each planet's photosphere. The planets display a diversity of 3-5 $\mu$m colors that could be due to differences in composition and ultimately be used to trace their formation history. They also show stronger CO2 absorption than expected from solar metallicity models, indicating that they are metal enriched. We detected 51 Eri b at 4.1 $\mu$m and not at longer wavelengths, which, given the planet's temperature, is indicative of out-of-equilibrium carbon chemistry and an enhanced metallicity. Updated orbits fit to the new measurement of 51 Eri b validate previous studies that find a preference for high eccentricities ($e{=}0.57_{-0.09}^{+0.03}$), which likely indicates some dynamical processing in the system's past. These results present an exciting opportunity to model the atmospheres and formation histories of these planets in more detail in the near future, and are complementary to future higher-resolution, continuum-subtracted JWST spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Circulation of Close-In Extrasolar Giant Planets: The Diabatic Equivalent-Barotropic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the description of equivalent-barotropic equations for exoplanets to the diabatic case -- that is, with explicit heating and/or cooling representation, rather than with a stationary deflection of the bottom bounding surface. In the diabatic case, the equation for potential temperature (or entropy) is directly forced and cannot be decoupled from the equations for momentum and nonlinear pressure, the mass-like variable; and, the isentropic surfaces do not remain coincident with material surfaces. Here the formalism is presented for an atmosphere with the Lamb vertical structure, as the formalism is substantially simplified under the structure. The equations presented set the stage for accurate global simulations which permit small-scale vortices, gravity waves, and fronts observed in current three-dimensional global simulations to be studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instability in protoplanetary disk with cooling: 2D global analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-gravity is important in protoplanetary disks for planet formation through gravitational instability (GI). We study the cooling effect on GI in a thin two-dimensional protoplanetary disk. By solving the linear perturbation equations in global geometry, we obtain all the normal modes. Faster cooling leads to faster growth rate of GI with lower azimuthal wavenumber $m$. According to the spatial structure of normal modes at different mass-averaged Toomre number $\overline{Q}$ and dimensionless cooling timescale $\beta$, we identify three modes: local, transitional and global. The transitional modes are located in the outer disk while the other two modes in the inner disk. At $\beta\approx 1$ (the resonance of dynamical timescale and thermal timescale) the growth rate changes sharply and the transitional modes dominate. The disk $\alpha$ due to GI is much higher in the transitional modes than in the other two. Our result implies that the transitional modes at $\overline{Q}\approx 1$ and $\beta\approx 1$ can plausibly interpret the substructures and planet/brown dwarf formation in the outer disk.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Constraints on Dust Dynamics and Size Evolution in Protoplanetary Disk Rings. I. Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) have revealed many dust rings in protoplanetary disks, often interpreted as dust traps at gas pressure bumps. Previous studies have typically modeled these rings by assuming a single dust species in drift-diffusion equilibrium, neglecting dust size evolution resulting from coagulation and fragmentation. In this work, we perform numerical simulations that incorporate both dust-gas dynamics (drift and diffusion) and dust size evolution. Our results show that the radial distributions of different dust species are nearly identical, as dust growth dominates over drift and diffusion. Building on this finding, we develop a comprehensive, self-consistent analytical theory that describes the dust ring structure while explicitly accounting for size evolution effects. Our model provides a unified framework for interpreting multi-wavelength observations by linking the physical dust distribution to the observed ring properties, thus laying the foundation for future observational modeling.</description>

      <title>First JWST spectrum of distant activity in Long Period Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the new Long Period Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos), inbound at 7 au from the Sun, using the NIRSpec integral field unit on JWST. The spectrum shows absorption features due to water ice in the coma and evidence for CO$_2$ driven activity, with a production rate of $Q(CO_2) = 2.546 \pm 0.019 \times 10^{25}$ molecules s$^{-1}$, and no emission features of water or CO. The latter is surprising, given that CO is more volatile than CO$_2$, and suggests that this comet may have lost its near-surface CO during its early evolution, before implantation in the Oort cloud.</description>

      <title>A pre-flyby view on the origin of asteroid Donaldjohanson, a target of the NASA Lucy mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NASA Lucy mission is scheduled to fly-by the main belt asteroid (52246) Donaldjohanson on April 20, 2025. Donaldjohanson (DJ hereafter) is a member of the primitive (C-type class) Erigone collisional asteroid family located in the inner main belt in proximity of the source regions of asteroid (101955)~Bennu and (162173)~Ryugu, visited respectively by OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 missions. In this paper we provide an updated model for the Erigone family age, and discuss DJ evolution resulting from non-gravitational forces (namely Yarkovsky and YORP), as well as its collisional evolution. We conclude the best-fit family age to be $\sim 155$~Myr, and that, on such timescales, both Yarkovsky and YORP effects may have affected the orbit and spin properties of DJ. Furthermore, we discuss how the NASA Lucy mission could provide independent insights on such processes, namely by constraining DJ shape, surface geology and cratering history.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the electric dipole moment of AlCl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the electric dipole moment of aluminum monochloride (AlCl) using a cryogenic buffer-gas beam source. Our measurements provide values for the dipole moments of the two lowest vibrational states of the $X^1\Sigma^+$ and the $A^1\Pi$ electronic states. We also show that spin-orbit coupling with an extended number of spin states is essential in the ab initio calculation to correctly describe both the dipole moment and the Te energy of AlCl. We further lay out the implications of these results for astrophysical models of stellar and planetary evolution that have used a substitute value for the dipole moment of AlCl until now.</description>

      <title>CoCCoA: Complex Chemistry in hot Cores with ALMA. The chemical evolution of acetone from ice to gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acetone (CH3COCH3) is one of the most abundant three-carbon oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (O-COMs) that have been detected in space. Recently, acetone ice has been reported as (tentatively) detected toward B1-c, which enables the gas-to-ice comparison of its abundances. The detection of acetone ice warrants a more systematic study of its gaseous abundances which is currently lacking. Therefore, we conducted systematic measurements of acetone gas in a dozen hot cores observed by the CoCCoA survey and investigate the chemical evolution from ice to gas of acetone in protostellar systems. We fit the ALMA spectra to determined the column density, excitation temperature, and line width of acetone, along with propanal (C2H5CHO), ketene (CH2CO), and propyne (CH3CCH), which might be chemically linked with acetone. We found that the observed gas abundances of acetone are surprisingly high compared to those of two-carbon O-COMs, while aldehydes are overall less abundant than other O-COMs (e.g., alcohols, ethers, and esters). This may suggest specific formation or destruction mechanisms that favor the production of ethers, esters, and ketones over aldehydes. The derived physical properties suggest that acetone, propanal, and ketene have the same origin from hot cores as other O-COMs, while propyne tends to trace the more extended outflows. The acetone-to-methanol ratios are higher in ice than in gas by one order of magnitude, hinting at gas-phase reprocessing after sublimation. There are several suggested formation pathways of acetone (in both ice and gas) from acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ketene, and propylene (C3H6). The observed ratios between acetone and the relevant species are rather constant across the sample, and can be well reproduced by astrochemical simulations, but more investigations are needed to draw solid conclusions.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 15 degrees can experience average residuals of 12.4 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 155 degrees at distances below 1500 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 10 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than two degrees beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>

      <title>Argon in beta Pictoris -- entrapment and release of volatile in disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical compositions of planets reveal much about their formation environments. Such information is well sought-after in studies of Solar System bodies and extra-solar ones. Here, we investigate the composition of planetesimals in the beta Pictoris debris disk, by way of its secondary gas disk. We are stimulated by the recent JWST detection of an ArII emission line, and aim to reproduce extensive measurements from the past four decades. Our photo-ionization model reveals that the gas has to be heavily enriched in C, N, O, and Ar (but not S and P), by a uniform factor of about 100 relative to other metals. Such an abundance pattern is both reminiscent of, and different from, that of Jupiter's atmosphere. The fact that Ar, the most volatile and therefore the hardest to capture into solids, is equally enriched as C, N, and O suggests that the planetesimals were formed in a very cold region (T &lt; 20- 35K), possibly with the help of entrapment if water ice is over-abundant. In the debris disk phase, these volatile are preferentially out-gassed from the dust grains, likely via photo-desorption. The debris grains must be `dirty' aggregates of icy and refractory clusters. Lastly, the observed strength of the ArII line can only be explained if the star beta Pic (a young A6V star) has sizable chromospheric and coronal emissions, on par with those from the modern Sun. In summary, observations of the beta Pic gas disk rewind the clock to reveal the formation environment of planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Breaking long-period resonance chains with stellar flybys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Planetary migration models predict multiple planets captured into a chain of mean-motion resonances during the disk phase. Over a dozen systems have been observed in these configurations, nearly all close-in planets, with a lack of resonant chains for planets with orbital periods larger than ~300 days. Aims. Dynamical studies often overlook the fact that stars do not evolve in isolation. In this work, we explore the possibility that the absence of giant planets in long-period resonant chains may be due to post-formation disruption caused by stellar flybys. Methods. For planets in the 2:1-2:1 and 3:2-3:2 resonant chains, we evaluate the long-term stability after varying parameters such as the planet masses, as well as the inclination, pericentric distance, and mass of the flyby star. Results. Our integrations show that the 2:1-2:1 resonant chain is significantly more resilient to a stellar flyby than for the 3:2-3:2 configuration. The nature of the instability is different in both scenarios, the 2:1-2:1 becomes unstable quickly, soon after a penetrative close encounter. Instead, planets in the 3:2-3:2 chain become unstable in long timescales due to more distant flybys (up to q/a_out ~ 25 for Jupiter-mass planets) that only provide small perturbations for the system to chaotically dissolve. Conclusions. If an encounter occurs between a star hosting planets and a passing star, Jupiter-mass systems with 3 planets in a 3:2-3:2 resonant chain or more compact initial configurations are likely to be disrupted.</description>

      <title>An Early Look at the Performance of IGRINS-2 at Gemini-North with Application to the ultrahot Jupiter, WASP-33 b</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy enables precise molecular detections, and velocity-resolved atmospheric dynamics, offering a distinct advantage over low-resolution methods for exoplanetary atmospheric studies. IGRINS-2, the successor to IGRINS, features improved throughput and enhanced sensitivity to carbon monoxide by shifting its $\textit{K}$-band coverage by ~36 nm to longer wavelengths. To evaluate its performance, we attempt to investigate the atmospheric characteristics of WASP-33 b. Observations were conducted on 2024 January 7 for a total of 2.43 hours; This includes 1.46 hours in the pre-eclipse phase to capture the planet's thermal emission spectrum. Our analysis, employing a composite atmospheric model, confirms the presence of a thermally inverted atmosphere on the planet's dayside with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 7.5. More specifically, we capture CO, H$_{2}$O, and OH with SNRs of 5.2, 4.2, and 4.4, respectively. These results are consistent with previous studies and demonstrate that IGRINS-2 is well-suited for detailed investigation of exoplanetary atmospheres. We anticipate that future observations with IGRINS-2 will further advance our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Astrometry and Precise Radial Velocities Yield a Complete Orbital Solution for the Nearby Eccentric Brown Dwarf LHS 1610 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LHS 1610 system consists of a nearby ($d=9.7$ pc) M5 dwarf hosting a candidate brown dwarf companion in a $10.6$ day, eccentric ($e \sim 0.37$) orbit. We confirm this brown dwarf designation and estimate its mass ($ 49.5_{-3.5}^{+4.3}$ $M_{\text{Jup}} $) and inclination ($ 114.5^\circ$ $_{-10.0}^{+7.4}$) by combining discovery radial velocities (RVs) from TRES and new RVs from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder with the available Gaia astrometric two-body solution. We highlight a discrepancy between the measurement of the eccentricity from the Gaia two-body solution ($e=0.52 \pm 0.03$) and the RV-only solution ($e=0.3702\pm0.0003$). We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, which can be further probed when the Gaia astrometric time series becomes available as part of Gaia DR4. As a nearby mid-M star hosting a massive short-period companion with a well-characterized orbit, LHS 1610 b is a promising target to look for evidence of sub-Alfv\'enic interactions and/or auroral emission at optical and radio wavelengths. LHS 1610 has a flare rate ($0.28\pm 0.07$ flares/day) on the higher-end for its rotation period ($84 \pm 8$ days), similar to other mid-M dwarf systems such as Proxima Cen and YZ Ceti that have recent radio detections compatible with star-planet interactions. While available TESS photometry is insufficient to determine an orbital phase-dependence of the flares, our complete orbital characterization of this system makes it attractive to probe star-companion interactions with additional photometric and radio observations.</description>

      <title>Eccentricities of Close Stellar Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. These eccentricities encode information about their early lives. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the Gaia DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode sigma_e ~ 0.3. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to a thousand days (possibly extending to tens of AU). This observed distribution is most likely primordial and its invariance suggests a single universal process. One possibility is eccentricity excitation by circumbinary disks. Another, as is suggested by the Rayleigh form, is weak scattering and ejection of brown-dwarf objects. We explore this latter scenario and find that the binary eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of sigma_e ~ sqrt{M_bd M_*}. So to explain the observed mode, the brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of both proposals remains to be tested.</description>

      <title>Novel SiC UV Instrumentation Development with Potential Applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>
