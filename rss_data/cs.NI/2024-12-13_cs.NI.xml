      <title>CLEAR: Channel Learning and Enhanced Adaptive Reconstruction for Semantic Communication in Complex Time-Varying Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenges of robust data transmission over complex time-varying channels, this paper introduces channel learning and enhanced adaptive reconstruction (CLEAR) strategy for semantic communications. CLEAR integrates deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) with an adaptive diffusion denoising model (ADDM) to form a unique framework. It leverages a trainable encoder-decoder architecture to encode data into complex semantic codes, which are then transmitted and reconstructed while minimizing distortion, ensuring high semantic fidelity. By addressing multipath effects, frequency-selective fading, phase noise, and Doppler shifts, CLEAR achieves high semantic fidelity and reliable transmission across diverse signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLEAR achieves a 2.3 dB gain on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) over the existing state-of-the-art method, DeepJSCC-V. Furthermore, the results verify that CLEAR is robust against varying channel conditions, particularly in scenarios characterized by high Doppler shifts and strong phase noise.</description>

      <title>FlexScatter: Predictive Scheduling and Adaptive Rateless Coding for Wi-Fi Backscatter Communications in Dynamic Traffic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of Wi-Fi backscatter communications systems is immense, yet challenges such as signal instability and energy constraints impose performance limits. This paper introduces FlexScatter, a Wi-Fi backscatter system using a designed scheduling strategy based on excitation prediction and rateless coding to enhance system performance. Initially, a Wi-Fi traffic prediction model is constructed by analyzing the variability of the excitation source. Then, an adaptive transmission scheduling algorithm is proposed to address the low energy consumption demands of backscatter tags, adjusting the transmission strategy according to predictive analytics and taming channel conditions. Furthermore, leveraging the benefits of low-density parity-check (LDPC) and fountain codes, a novel coding and decoding algorithm is developed, which is tailored for dynamic channel conditions. Experimental validation shows that FlexScatter reduces bit error rates (BER) by up to 30%, improves energy efficiency by 7%, and increases overall system utility by 11%, compared to conventional methods. FlexScatter's ability to balance energy consumption and communication efficiency makes it a robust solution for future IoT applications that rely on unpredictable Wi-Fi traffic.</description>

      <title>Improving the Reliability of Cable Broadband Networks via Proactive Network Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cable broadband networks are one of the few "last-mile" broadband technologies widely available in the U.S. Unfortunately, they have poor reliability after decades of deployment. The cable industry proposed a framework called Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) to diagnose the cable networks. However, there is little public knowledge or systematic study on how to use these data to detect and localize cable network problems. Existing tools in the public domain have prohibitive high false-positive rates. In this paper, we propose CableMon, the first public-domain system that applies machine learning techniques to PNM data to improve the reliability of cable broadband networks. CableMon tackles two key challenges faced by cable ISPs: accurately detecting failures, and distinguishing whether a failure occurs within a network or at a subscriber's premise. CableMon uses statistical models to generate features from time series data and uses customer trouble tickets as hints to infer abnormal/failure thresholds for these generated features. Further, CableMon employs an unsupervised learning model to group cable devices sharing similar anomalous patterns and effectively identify impairments that occur inside a cable network and impairments occur at a subscriber's premise, as these two different faults require different types of technical personnel to repair them. We use eight months of PNM data and customer trouble tickets from an ISP and experimental deployment to evaluate CableMon's performance. Our evaluation results show that CableMon can effectively detect and distinguish failures from PNM data and outperforms existing public-domain tools.</description>

      <title>Integrating Optimization Theory with Deep Learning for Wireless Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional wireless network design relies on optimization algorithms derived from domain-specific mathematical models, which are often inefficient and unsuitable for dynamic, real-time applications due to high complexity. Deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative to overcome complexity and adaptability concerns, but it faces challenges such as accuracy issues, delays, and limited interpretability due to its inherent black-box nature. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates optimization theory with deep learning methodologies to address these issues. The methodology starts by constructing the block diagram of the optimization theory-based solution, identifying key building blocks corresponding to optimality conditions and iterative solutions. Selected building blocks are then replaced with deep neural networks, enhancing the adaptability and interpretability of the system. Extensive simulations show that this hybrid approach not only reduces runtime compared to optimization theory based approaches but also significantly improves accuracy and convergence rates, outperforming pure deep learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving state-of-the-art performance across various image-based tasks and beyond. In this study, we employ a ViT-based neural network to address the problem of indoor pathloss radio map prediction. The network's generalization ability is evaluated across diverse settings, including unseen buildings, frequencies, and antennas with varying radiation patterns. By leveraging extensive data augmentation techniques and pretrained DINOv2 weights, we achieve promising results, even under the most challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Address Family Selection for Latency-Sensitive Applications on Dual-stack Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latency is becoming a key factor of performance for Internet applications and has triggered a number of changes in its protocols. Our work revisits the impact on latency of address family selection in dual-stack hosts. Through RIPE Atlas measurements, we analyse the address families latency difference and establish two requirements based on our findings for a latency-focused selection mechanism. First, the address family should be chosen per destination. Second, the choice should be able to evolve over time dynamically. We propose and implement a solution formulated as an online learning problem balancing exploration and exploitation. We validate our solution in simulations based on RIPE Atlas measurements, implement and evaluate our prototype in four access networks using Chrome and popular web services. We demonstrate the ability of our solution to converge towards the lowest-latency address family and improve the latency of transport connections used by applications.</description>

      <title>WT-CFormer: High-Performance Web Traffic Anomaly Detection Based on Spatiotemporal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web traffic (WT) refers to time-series data that captures the volume of data transmitted to and from a web server during a user's visit to a website. However, web traffic has different distributions coming from various sources as well as the imbalance between normal and abnormal categories, it is difficult to accurately and efficiently identify abnormal web traffic. Deep neural network approaches for web traffic anomaly detection have achieved cutting-edge classification performance. In order to achieve high-performance spatiotemporal detection of network attacks, we innovatively design WT-CFormer, which integrates Transformer and CNN, effectively capturing the temporal and spatial characteristics. We conduct a large numbr of experiments to evaluate the method we proposed. The results show that WT-CFormer has the highest performance, obtaining a recall as high as 96.79%, a precision of 97.35%, an F1 score of 97.07%, and an accuracy of 99.43%, which is 7.09%,1.15%, 4.77%, and 0.83% better than the state-of-the-art method, followed by C-LSTM, CTGA, random forest, and KNN algorithms. In addition, we find that the classification performance of WT-CFormer with only 50 training epochs outperforms C-LSTM with 500 training epochs, which greatly improves the convergence performance. Finally, we perform ablation experiments to demonstrate the necessity of each component within WT-CFormer.</description>

      <title>OneAdapt: Fast Configuration Adaptation for Video Analytics Applications via Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning inference on streaming media data, such as object detection in video or LiDAR feeds and text extraction from audio waves, is now ubiquitous. To achieve high inference accuracy, these applications typically require significant network bandwidth to gather high-fidelity data and extensive GPU resources to run deep neural networks (DNNs). While the high demand for network bandwidth and GPU resources could be substantially reduced by optimally adapting the configuration knobs, such as video resolution and frame rate, current adaptation techniques fail to meet three requirements simultaneously: adapt configurations (i) with minimum extra GPU or bandwidth overhead; (ii) to reach near-optimal decisions based on how the data affects the final DNN's accuracy, and (iii) do so for a range of configuration knobs. This paper presents OneAdapt, which meets these requirements by leveraging a gradient-ascent strategy to adapt configuration knobs. The key idea is to embrace DNNs' differentiability to quickly estimate the accuracy's gradient to each configuration knob, called AccGrad. Specifically, OneAdapt estimates AccGrad by multiplying two gradients: InputGrad (i.e. how each configuration knob affects the input to the DNN) and DNNGrad (i.e. how the DNN input affects the DNN inference output). We evaluate OneAdapt across five types of configurations, four analytic tasks, and five types of input data. Compared to state-of-the-art adaptation schemes, OneAdapt cuts bandwidth usage and GPU usage by 15-59% while maintaining comparable accuracy or improves accuracy by 1-5% while using equal or fewer resources.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Based Artificial Topology: Neighboring Remote Network Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</description>
