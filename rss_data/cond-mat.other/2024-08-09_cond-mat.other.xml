      <title>A non-Hermitian loop for a quantum measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a framework for a mechanism steering state vector collapse through time evolution as described by the Schr\"odinger's equation. Under the premise of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics, a main outcome is that collapse has to occur when the Hamiltonian completes a closed loop in the parameter space encoding the interaction with the meter. For two-level systems, we put forward the phenomenon of chiral state conversion as a mechanism effectively eliminating superpositions. Our results open a way to simulate quantum measurements in classical systems that up to now were restricted to the Schr\"odinger part of the quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Model for the dynamics of carrier injection in a band with polaronic states: Application to exciton dissociation in organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quantum model for the dynamics of carrier injection in a band that presents a strong carrier-vibration coupling. This coupling modifies the spectral density of the band and can even create pseudo-gaps that sign the onset of polaronic states. The injection of a carrier that interacts with many vibration modes is a complex many-body process that is treated by combining the quantum scattering theory and the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). For the model analysed here, which is adapted to compact phases, the number Z of neighbors of a given site is large and in this limit the DMFT becomes exact. The model is applied to the excitonic dissociation at the donor-acceptor interface for organic solar cells. The main ingredients are the electron-hole Coulomb interaction, the recombination process and the existence of polaronic states in the acceptor band. Using parameters extracted from ab-initio calculations we analyze the spectral density on the charge transfer state (CTS), the average energy transfered to phonons on the CTS and the quantum yield of the injection process. We find in particular that, even with a strong electron-vibration coupling, one can get a vibrationally cold charge transfer state with a high injection yield as often observed experimentally.</description>
