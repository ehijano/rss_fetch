      <title>Realizing RF Wavefront Copying with RIS for Future Extended Reality Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lately a new approach to Extended Reality (XR), denoted as XR-RF, has been proposed which is realized by combining Radio Frequency (RF) Imaging and programmable wireless environments (PWEs). RF Imaging is a technique that aims to detect geometric and material features of an object through RF waves. On the other hand, the PWE focuses on the the conversion of the wireless RF propagation in a controllable, by software, entity through the utilization of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), which can have a controllable interaction with impinging RF waves. In that sense, this dynamic synergy leverages the potential of RF Imaging to detect the structure of an object through RF wavefronts and the PWE's ability to selectively replicate those RF wavefronts from one spatial location to wherever an XR-RF mobile user is presently located. Then the captured wavefront, through appropriate hardware, is mapped to the visual representation of the object through machine learning models. As a key aspect of the XR-RF's system workflow is the wavefront copying mechanism, this work introduces a new PWE configuration algorithm for XR-RF. Moreover, it is shown that the waveform replication process inevitably yields imprecision in the replication process. After statistical analysis, based on simulation results, it is shown that this imprecision can be effectively modeled by the gamma distribution.</description>

      <title>Enhanced In-Flight Connectivity for Urban Air Mobility via LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is the envisioned future of inter-city aerial transportation. This paper presents a novel, in-flight connectivity link allocation method for UAM, which dynamically switches between terrestrial cellular and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks based on real-time conditions. Our approach prefers cellular networks for cost efficiency, switching to LEO satellites under poor cellular conditions to ensure continuous UAM connectivity. By integrating real-time metrics like signal strength, network congestion, and flight trajectory into the selection process, our algorithm effectively balances cost, minimum data rate requirements, and continuity of communication. Numerical results validate minimization of data-loss while ensuring an optimal selection from the set of available above-threshold data rates at every time sample. Furthermore, insights derived from our study emphasize the importance of hybrid connectivity solutions in ensuring seamless, uninterrupted communication for future urban aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search for In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ neural architecture search (NAS) to enhance the efficiency of deploying diverse machine learning (ML) tasks on in-memory computing (IMC) architectures. Initially, we design three fundamental components inspired by the convolutional layers found in VGG and ResNet models. Subsequently, we utilize Bayesian optimization to construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with adaptable depths, employing these components. Through the Bayesian search algorithm, we explore a vast search space comprising over 640 million network configurations to identify the optimal solution, considering various multi-objective cost functions like accuracy/latency and accuracy/energy. Our evaluation of this NAS approach for IMC architecture deployment spans three distinct image classification datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in achieving a balanced solution characterized by high accuracy and reduced latency and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>$Classi|Q\rangle$ Towards a Translation Framework To Bridge The Classical-Quantum Programming Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, albeit readily available as hardware or emulated on the cloud, is still far from being available in general regarding complex programming paradigms and learning curves. This vision paper introduces $Classi|Q\rangle$, a translation framework idea to bridge Classical and Quantum Computing by translating high-level programming languages, e.g., Python or C++, into a low-level language, e.g., Quantum Assembly. Our idea paper serves as a blueprint for ongoing efforts in quantum software engineering, offering a roadmap for further $Classi|Q\rangle$ development to meet the diverse needs of researchers and practitioners. $Classi|Q\rangle$ is designed to empower researchers and practitioners with no prior quantum experience to harness the potential of hybrid quantum computation. We also discuss future enhancements to $Classi|Q\rangle$, including support for additional quantum languages, improved optimization strategies, and integration with emerging quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Quantum Transpilers: Evaluating the Performance of qiskit-braket-provider, qBraid-SDK, and Pytket Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of several quantum transpilers, including the qiskit-braket-provider, the qBraid-SDK, and the pytket extensions, focusing on critical metrics such as correctness, failure rate, and transpilation time. Our results demonstrate that the qiskit-braket-provider exhibits superior performance achieving a remarkably low failure rate of 0.2%. the qiskit-braket-provider utilizes a combination of one-to-one transpilation and gate decomposition for unsupported gates, enhancing transpiler capabilities and speed. The qBraid-SDK offers a more generalized approach, suitable for transpilation across multiple SDKs, albeit with slower performance compared to the qiskit-braket-provider. The pytket extensions, while fast, exhibit limitations in handling complex circuits due to their one-to-one transpilation scheme. We also provide recommendations for future development, advocating for the adoption of the method employed by the qiskit-braket-provider to enhance transpiler capabilities and speed. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge in quantum transpiler benchmarking, fostering interoperability and guiding the development of quantum computing applications in a diverse hardware and software landscape.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Social Networks and the Future of Free Speech Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized social networks like Mastodon and BlueSky are trending topics that have drawn much attention and discussion in recent years. By devolving powers from the central node to the end users, decentralized social networks aim to cure existing pathologies on the centralized platforms and have been viewed by many as the future of the Internet. This article critically and systematically assesses the decentralization project's prospect for communications online. It uses normative theories of free speech to examine whether and how the decentralization design could facilitate users' freedom of expression online. The analysis shows that both promises and pitfalls exist, highlighting the importance of value-based design in this area. Two most salient issues for the design of the decentralized networks are: how to balance the decentralization ideal with constant needs of centralization on the network, and how to empower users to make them truly capable of exercising their control. The article then uses some design examples, such as the shared blocklist and the opt-in search function, to illustrate the value considerations underlying the design choices. Some tentative proposals for law and policy interventions are offered to better facilitate the design of the new network. Rather than providing clear answers, the article seeks to map the value implications of the design choices, highlight the stakes, and point directions for future research.</description>

Abstract: Digital Twins have evolved as a concept describing digital representations of physical assets. They can be used to facilitate simulations, monitoring, or optimization of product lifecycles. Considering the concept of a Circular Economy, which entails several lifecycles of, e.g., vehicles, their components, and materials, it is important to investigate how the respective Digital Twins are managed over the lifecycle of their physical assets. This publication presents and compares three approaches for managing Digital Twins in industrial use cases. The analysis considers aspects such as updates, data ownership, and data sovereignty.

      <title>Implementation of digital MemComputing using standard electronic components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital MemComputing machines (DMMs), which employ nonlinear dynamical systems with memory (time non-locality), have proven to be a robust and scalable unconventional computing approach for solving a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems. However, most of the research so far has focused on the numerical simulations of the equations of motion of DMMs. This inevitably subjects time to discretization, which brings its own (numerical) issues that would be otherwise absent in actual physical systems operating in continuous time. Although hardware realizations of DMMs have been previously suggested, their implementation would require materials and devices that are not so easy to integrate with traditional electronics. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel hardware design for DMMs, utilizing readily available electronic components. This approach not only significantly boosts computational speed compared to current models but also exhibits remarkable robustness against additive noise. Crucially, it circumvents the limitations imposed by numerical noise, ensuring enhanced stability and reliability during extended operations. This paves a new path for tackling increasingly complex problems, leveraging the inherent advantages of DMMs in a more practical and accessible framework.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic quadratic programming for efficient and scalable model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications in robotics or other size-, weight- and power-constrained autonomous systems at the edge often require real-time and low-energy solutions to large optimization problems. Event-based and memory-integrated neuromorphic architectures promise to solve such optimization problems with superior energy efficiency and performance compared to conventional von Neumann architectures. Here, we present a method to solve convex continuous optimization problems with quadratic cost functions and linear constraints on Intel's scalable neuromorphic research chip Loihi 2. When applied to model predictive control (MPC) problems for the quadruped robotic platform ANYmal, this method achieves over two orders of magnitude reduction in combined energy-delay product compared to the state-of-the-art solver, OSQP, on (edge) CPUs and GPUs with solution times under ten milliseconds for various problem sizes. These results demonstrate the benefit of non-von-Neumann architectures for robotic control applications.</description>
