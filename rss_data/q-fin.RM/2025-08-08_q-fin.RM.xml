      <title>Periodic evaluation of defined-contribution pension fund: A dynamic risk measure approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework for the periodic evaluation of defined-contribution pension funds. The performance of the pension fund is evaluated not only at retirement, but also within the interim periods. In contrast to the traditional literature, we set the dynamic risk measure as the criterion and manage the tail risk of the pension fund dynamically. To effectively interact with the stochastic environment, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to search for optimal investment and insurance strategies. Using U.S. data, we calibrate pension members' mortality rates and enhance mortality projections through a Lee-Carter model. Our numerical results indicate that periodic evaluations lead to more risk-averse strategies, while mortality improvements encourage more risk-seeking behaviors.</description>

      <title>Tail Risk Alert Based on Conditional Autoregressive VaR by Regression Quantiles and Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the increasing application of AI in finance, this paper will leverage AI algorithms to examine tail risk and develop a model to alter tail risk to promote the stability of US financial markets, and enhance the resilience of the US economy. Specifically, the paper constructs a multivariate multilevel CAViaR model, optimized by gradient descent and genetic algorithm, to study the tail risk spillover between the US stock market, foreign exchange market and credit market. The model is used to provide early warning of related risks in US stocks, US credit bonds, etc. The results show that, by analyzing the direction, magnitude, and pseudo-impulse response of the risk spillover, it is found that the credit market's spillover effect on the stock market and its duration are both greater than the spillover effect of the stock market and the other two markets on credit market, placing credit market in a central position for warning of extreme risks. Its historical information on extreme risks can serve as a predictor of the VaR of other markets.</description>
