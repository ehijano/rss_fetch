      <title>Leveraging Fundamental Analysis for Stock Trend Prediction for Profit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of machine learning models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D CNN), and Logistic Regression (LR), for predicting stock trends based on fundamental analysis. Unlike most existing studies that predominantly utilize technical or sentiment analysis, we emphasize the use of a company's financial statements and intrinsic value for trend forecasting. Using a dataset of 269 data points from publicly traded companies across various sectors from 2019 to 2023, we employ key financial ratios and the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to formulate two prediction tasks: Annual Stock Price Difference (ASPD) and Difference between Current Stock Price and Intrinsic Value (DCSPIV). These tasks assess the likelihood of annual profit and current profitability, respectively. Our results demonstrate that LR models outperform CNN and LSTM models, achieving an average test accuracy of 74.66% for ASPD and 72.85% for DCSPIV. This study contributes to the limited literature on integrating fundamental analysis into machine learning for stock prediction, offering valuable insights for both academic research and practical investment strategies. By leveraging fundamental data, our approach highlights the potential for long-term stock trend prediction, supporting portfolio managers in their decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Postprocessing of point predictions for probabilistic forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices: The benefits of using isotonic distributional regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operational decisions relying on predictive distributions of electricity prices can result in significantly higher profits compared to those based solely on point forecasts. However, the majority of models developed in both academic and industrial settings provide only point predictions. To address this, we examine three postprocessing methods for converting point forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices into probabilistic ones: Quantile Regression Averaging, Conformal Prediction, and the recently introduced Isotonic Distributional Regression. We find that while the latter demonstrates the most varied behavior, it contributes the most to the ensemble of the three predictive distributions, as measured by Shapley values. Remarkably, the performance of the combination is superior to that of state-of-the-art Distributional Deep Neural Networks over two 4.5-year test periods from the German and Spanish power markets, spanning the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine.</description>

      <title>Predicting Foreign Exchange EUR/USD direction using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Foreign Exchange market is a significant market for speculators, characterized by substantial transaction volumes and high volatility. Accurately predicting the directional movement of currency pairs is essential for formulating a sound financial investment strategy. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of various machine learning models for predicting the daily directional movement of the EUR/USD currency pair in the Foreign Exchange market. The analysis includes both decorrelated and non-decorrelated feature sets using Principal Component Analysis. Additionally, this study explores meta-estimators, which involve stacking multiple estimators as input for another estimator, aiming to achieve improved predictive performance. Ultimately, our approach yielded a prediction accuracy of 58.52% for one-day ahead forecasts, coupled with an annual return of 32.48% for the year 2022.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds of Uncertainty of Observations of Macroeconomic Variables and Upper Limits on the Accuracy of Their Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper defines theoretical lower bounds of uncertainty of observations of macroeconomic variables that depend on statistical moments and correlations of random values and volumes of market trades. Any econometric assessments of macroeconomic variables have greater uncertainty. We consider macroeconomic variables as random that depend on random values and volumes of trades. To predict random macroeconomic variables, one should forecast their probabilities. Upper limits on the accuracy of the forecasts of probabilities of macroeconomic variables, prices, and returns depend on the number of predicted statistical moments. We consider economic obstacles that limit by the first two the number of predicted statistical moments. The accuracy of any forecasts of probabilities of random macroeconomic variables, prices, returns, and market trades doesn't exceed the accuracy of Gaussian approximations. Any forecasts of macroeconomic variables have uncertainty higher than one determined by predictions of coefficients of variation of random values and volumes of trades.</description>
