      <title>Large degree vertices in random directed acyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Master's thesis examines the properties of large degree vertices in random recursive directed acyclic graphs (RRDAGs), a generalization of the well-studied random recursive tree (RRT) model. Using a novel adaptation of Kingman's coalescent, we extend results from RRTs to RRDAGs, focusing on different vertex properties. For large degrees, we establish the asymptotic joint distribution of the degree of multiple uniform vertices, proving that they follow a multivariate geometric distribution, and obtain results on maximal and near-maximal degree vertices. In addition, we consider a version of vertex depth that we call ungreedy depth and describe its asymptotic behavior, along with the labels, of single uniform vertices with a given large degree. Finally, we extend this analysis to multiple uniform vertices by deriving the asymptotic behavior of their labels conditional on large degrees.</description>

      <title>The extremal process of two-speed branching random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-speed branching random walk, which consists of two macroscopic stages with different reproduction laws. We prove that the centered maximum converges in law to a Gumbel variable with a random shift and the extremal process converges in law to a randomly shifted decorated Poisson point process, which can be viewed as a discrete analog for the corresponding results for the two-speed branching Brownian motion, previously established by Bovier and Hartung [12].</description>

      <title>A note on the uniform ergodicity of diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss the uniform ergodicity of a diffusion process given by an It\^o stochastic differential equation. We present an integral condition in terms of the drift and diffusion coefficients that ensures the uniform ergodicity of the corresponding transition kernel with respect to the total variation distance. Applications of the obtained results to a class of subordinate diffusion processes are also presented.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative convolution with symmetries in Euclidean space and on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicative convolution $\mu \ast \nu$ of two finite signed measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a related product $\mu \circledast \nu$ on the sphere $S^{n-1}$ are studied. For fixed $\mu$ the injectivity in $\nu$ of both operations is characterised given an arbitrary group of reflections along the coordinate axes. The results for the sphere yield generalised versions of the theorems in Molchanov and Nagel (2021) about convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Fatou limits of stochastic integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of stochastic integrals is essential to stochastic analysis, especially in applications to mathematical finance, where they model the gains associated with a self-financing strategy. However, Fatou convergence of $(X^{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ $\unicode{x2014}$a notion introduced for its amenability to compactness principles$\unicode{x2014}$implies little about the sequence of It\^o integrals $\left(\int_{0}^{\cdot}YdX^{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ for a fixed integrand $Y$. Under a boundedness condition, we find convex combinations $(\widetilde{X}^{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of $(X^{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ with Fatou limit $\widetilde{X}$, such that $\left(\int_{0}^{\cdot}Yd\widetilde{X}^{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges in a Fatou-like sense to $\int_{0}^{\cdot}Yd\widetilde{X}$ for all continuous semimartingales $Y$. The result is sharp, in the sense that continuity of $Y$ cannot be relaxed to being the left limits process of a semimartingale.</description>

      <title>Stationary fluctuation for the occupation time of the multi-species stirring process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a fluctuation theorem for the occupation time of the multi-species stirring process on a lattice starting from a stationary distribution. Our result shows that the occupation times of different species interact with each other at the level of equilibrium fluctuation. The proof of our result utilizes the resolvent strategy introduced in \cite{Kipnis1987}. A coupling relationship between the multi-species stirring process and an auxiliary process and a graphical representation of the auxiliary process play the key roles in the proof.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation transition in the Wigner minor process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Wigner minor process, i.e. the eigenvalues of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix $H^{(N)}$ together with the eigenvalues of all its $n\times n$ minors, $H^{(n)}$, $n\le N$. The top eigenvalues of $H^{(N)}$ and those of its immediate minor $H^{(N-1)}$ are very strongly correlated, but this correlation becomes weaker for smaller minors $H^{(N-k)}$ as $k$ increases. For the GUE minor process the critical transition regime around $k\sim N^{2/3}$ was analyzed by Forrester and Nagao (J. Stat. Mech.: Theory and Experiment, 2011) providing an explicit formula for the nontrivial joint correlation function. We prove that this formula is universal, i.e. it holds for the Wigner minor process. Moreover, we give a complete analysis of the sub- and supercritical regimes both for eigenvalues and for the corresponding eigenvector overlaps, thus we prove the decorrelation transition in full generality.</description>

      <title>Randomisation of rough stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rough stochastic differential equations (RSDEs) are common generalisations
  of Ito SDEs and Lyons RDEs and have emerged as new tool in several areas
  of applied probability, including non-linear stochastic filtering, pathwise
  stochastic optimal control, volatility modelling in finance and mean-fields
  analysis of common noise system.
  We here take a unified perspective on rough Ito processes and discuss in
  particular when and how they become, upon randomisation, "doubly
  stochastic" Ito processes, and what can be said about their conditional laws.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of roots of randomized derivative polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic macroscopic behavior of the root sets of iterated, randomized derivatives of polynomials. The randomization depend on a parameter of inverse temperature $\beta \in (0, \infty]$, the case $\beta = \infty$ corresponding to the situation where one considers the derivative of polynomials, without randomization. Our constructions can be connected to random matrix theory: in particular, as detailed in Section 2, for $\beta = 2$ and roots on the real line, we get the distribution of the eigenvalues of minors of unitarily invariant random matrices. We prove that the asymptotic macroscopic behavior of the roots, i.e. the hydrodynamic limit, does not depend on $\beta$, and coincides with what we obtain for the non-randomized iterated derivatives, i.e. for $\beta = \infty$. Since recent results obtained for iterated derivations show that the limiting dynamics is governed by a non-local and non-linear PDE, we can transfer this information to the macroscopic behavior of the randomized setting. Our proof is completely explicit and relies on the analysis of increments in a triangular bivariate Markov chain.</description>

      <title>A sharper Lyapunov-Katz central limit error bound for i.i.d. summands Zolotarev-close to normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a central limit error bound for convolution powers of laws with finite moments of order $r \in \mathopen]2,3\mathclose]$, taking a closeness of the laws to normality into account. Up to a universal constant, this generalises the case of $r=3$ of the sharpening of the Berry (1941) - Esseen (1942) theorem obtained by Mattner (2024), namely by sharpening here the Katz (1963) error bound for the i.i.d. case of Lyapunov's (1901) theorem. Our proof uses a partial generalisation of the theorem of Senatov and Zolotarev (1986) used for the earlier special case. A result more general than our main one could be obtained by using instead another theorem of Senatov (1980), but unfortunately an auxiliary inequality used in the latter's proof is wrong.</description>

      <title>First- and Half-order Schemes for Regime Switching Stochastic Differential Equation with Non-differentiable Drift Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit first-order drift-randomized Milstein scheme for a regime switching stochastic differential equation is proposed and its bi-stability and rate of strong convergence are investigated for a non-differentiable drift coefficient.
  Precisely, drift is Lipschitz continuous while diffusion along with its derivative is Lipschitz continuous.
  Further, we explore the significance of evaluating Brownian trajectories at every switching time of the underlying Markov chain in achieving the convergence rate $1.0$ of the proposed scheme.
  In this context, possible variants of the scheme, namely modified randomized and reduced randomized schemes, are considered and their convergence rates are shown to be $1/2$.
  Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the convergence rates of these schemes along with their corresponding non-randomized versions.
  Further, it is illustrated that the half-order non-randomized reduced and modified schemes outperforms the classical Euler scheme.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for One-Dimensional Homogenized Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two limit theorems, a mean ergodic and a central limit theorem, for a specific class of one-dimensional diffusion processes that depend on a small-scale parameter $\varepsilon$ and converge weakly to a homogenized diffusion process in the limit $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. In these results, we allow for the time horizon to blow up such that $T_\varepsilon \rightarrow \infty$ as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. The novelty of the results arises from the circumstance that many quantities are unbounded for $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, so that formerly established theory is not directly applicable here and a careful investigation of all relevant $\varepsilon$-dependent terms is required. As a mathematical application, we then use these limit theorems to prove asymptotic properties of a minimum distance estimator for parameters in a homogenized diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>A new look on large deviations and concentration inequalities for the Ewens-Pitman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ewens-Pitman model is a probability distribution for random partitions of the set $[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$, parameterized by $\alpha\in[0,1)$ and $\theta&gt;-\alpha$, with $\alpha=0$ corresponding to the Ewens model in population genetics. The goal of this paper is to provide an alternative and concise proof of the Feng-Hoppe large deviation principle for the number $K_{n}$ of partition sets in the Ewens-Pitman model with $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $\theta&gt;-\alpha$. Our approach leverages an integral representation of the moment-generating function of $K_{n}$ in terms of the (one-parameter) Mittag-Leffler function, along with a sharp asymptotic expansion of it. This approach significantly simplifies the original proof of Feng-Hoppe large deviation principle, as it avoids all the technical difficulties arising from a continuity argument with respect to rational and non-rational values of $\alpha$. Beyond large deviations for $K_{n}$, our approach allows to establish a sharp concentration inequality for $K_n$ involving the rate function of the large deviation principle.</description>

      <title>Invariance of three-dimensional Bessel bridges in terms of time reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $a,b\ge 0$ and $t&gt;0$, let $\rho =\{ \rho _{s}\} _{0\le s\le t}$ be a three-dimensional Bessel bridge from $a$ to $b$ over $[0,t]$. In this paper, based on a conditional identity in law between Brownian bridges stemming from Pitman's theorem, we show in particular that the process given by \begin{align*}
  \rho _{s}+\Bigl| b-a+
  \min _{0\le u\le s}\rho _{u}-\min _{s\le u\le t}\rho _{u}
  \Bigr|
  -\Bigl|
  \min _{0\le u\le s}\rho _{u}-\min _{s\le u\le t}\rho _{u}
  \Bigr| ,\quad 0\le s\le t, \end{align*} has the same law as the time reversal $\{ \rho _{t-s}\} _{0\le s\le t}$ of $\rho $. As an immediate application, letting $R=\{ R_{s}\} _{s\ge 0}$ be a three-dimensional Bessel process starting from $a$, we obtain the following time-reversal and time-inversion results on $R$: $\{ R_{t-s}\} _{0\le s\le t}$ is identical in law with the process given by \begin{align*}
  R_{s}+R_{t}-2\min _{s\le u\le t}R_{u},\quad 0\le s\le t, \end{align*} when $a=0$, and $\{ sR_{1/s}\} _{s&gt;0}$ is identical in law with the process given by \begin{align*}
  R_{s}-2(1+s)\min _{0\le u\le s}\frac{R_{u}}{1+u}+a(1+s),\quad s&gt;0, \end{align*} for every $a\ge 0$.</description>

      <title>On the Wasserstein alignment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose we are given two metric spaces and a family of continuous transformations from one to the other. Given a probability distribution on each of these two spaces - namely the source and the target measures - the Wasserstein alignment problem seeks the transformation that minimizes the optimal transport cost between its pushforward of the source distribution and the target distribution, ensuring the closest possible alignment in a probabilistic sense. Examples of interest include two distributions on two Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we want a spatial embedding of the $n$-dimensional source measure in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that is closest in some Wasserstein metric to the target distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Similar data alignment problems also commonly arise in shape analysis and computer vision. In this paper we show that this nonconvex optimal transport projection problem admits a convex Kantorovich-type dual. This allows us to characterize the set of projections and devise a linear programming algorithm. For certain special examples, such as orthogonal transformations on Euclidean spaces of unequal dimensions and the $2$-Wasserstein cost, we characterize the covariance of the optimal projections. Our results also cover the generalization when we penalize each transformation by a function. An example is the inner product Gromov-Wasserstein distance minimization problem which has recently gained popularity.</description>

      <title>Grab It Before It's Gone: Testing Uncertain Rewards under a Stochastic Deadline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sequential estimation problem for an unknown reward in the presence of a random horizon. The reward takes one of two predetermined values which can be inferred from the drift of a Wiener process, which serves as a signal. The objective is to use the information in the signal to estimate the reward which is made available until a stochastic deadline that depends on its value. The observer must therefore work quickly to determine if the reward is favorable and claim it before the deadline passes. Under general assumptions on the stochastic deadline, we provide a full characterization of the solution that includes an identification with the unique solution to a free-boundary problem. Our analysis derives regularity properties of the solution that imply its ``smooth fit'' with the boundary data, and we show that the free-boundary solves a particular integral equation. The continuity of the free-boundary is also established under additional structural assumptions that lead to its representation in terms of a continuous transformation of a monotone function. We provide illustrations for several examples of interest.</description>

      <title>Switching to a Green and sustainable finance setting: a mean field game approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a continuum of carbon-emitting firms who seek to maximise their stock price, and a regulator (e.g., Government) who wishes for the economy to flourish, whilst simultaneously punishing firms who behave non-green. Interpreting the regulator as a major player and the firms as the minor players, we model this setting through a mean field game with major and minor players. We extend the stochastic maximum principle derived by Carmona &amp; Zhu [A probabilistic approach to mean field games with major and minor players. Annals of Applied Probability, 2016, 94, 745--788] by relaxing the assumptions on the forms of the minimisers for the Hamiltonians, allowing them to depend on more arguments. This allows the major and representative minor player to interact in a more natural fashion, thereby permitting us to consider more realistic models for our green and sustainable finance problem. Through our stochastic maximum principle, we derive explicit Nash equilibria for a number of examples.</description>

      <title>The soccer model, stochastic ordering and martingale transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tournaments are competitions between a number of teams, the outcome of which determines the relative strength or rank of each team. In many cases, the strength of a team in the tournament is given by a score. Perhaps, the most striking mathematical result on the tournament is Moon's theorem, which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a feasible score sequence via majorization. To give a probabilistic interpretation of Moon's result, Aldous and Kolesnik introduced the soccer model,the existence of which gives a short proof of Moon's theorem. However, the existence proof of Aldous and Kolesnik is nonconstructive, leading to the question of a ``canonical'' construction of the soccer model. The purpose of this paper is to provide explicit constructions of the soccer model with an additional stochastic ordering constraint, which can be formulated by martingale transport. Two solutions are given: one is by solving an entropy optimization problem via Sinkhorn's algorithm, and the other relies on the idea of shadow couplings. It turns out that both constructions yield the property of strong stochastic transitivity. The nontransitive situations of the soccer model are also considered.</description>

      <title>On Construction, Properties and Simulation of Haar-Based Multifractional Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifractional processes extend the concept of fractional Brownian motion by replacing the constant Hurst parameter with a time-varying Hurst function. This extension allows for modulation of the roughness of sample paths over time. The paper introduces a new class of multifractional processes, the Gaussian Haar-based multifractional processes (GHBMP), which is based on the Haar wavelet series representations. The resulting processes cover a significantly broader set of Hurst functions compared to the existing literature, enhancing their suitability for both practical applications and theoretical studies. The theoretical properties of these processes are investigated. Simulation studies conducted for various Hurst functions validate the proposed model and demonstrate its applicability, even for Hurst functions exhibiting discontinuous behaviour.</description>

      <title>Global maximum principle for optimal control of stochastic Volterra equations with singular kernels: An infinite dimensional approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider optimal control problems of stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) with singular kernels, where the control domain is not necessarily convex. We establish a global maximum principle by means of the spike variation technique. To do so, we first show a Taylor type expansion of the controlled SVE with respect to the spike variation, where the convergence rates of the remainder terms are characterized by the singularity of the kernels. Next, assuming additional structure conditions for the kernels, we convert the variational SVEs appearing in the expansion to their infinite dimensional lifts. Then, we derive first and second order adjoint equations in form of infinite dimensional backward stochastic evolution equations (BSEEs) on weighted $L^2$ spaces. Moreover, we show the well-posedness of the new class of BSEEs on weighted $L^2$ spaces in a general setting.</description>

      <title>Condensation in subcritical Cauchy Bienaym\'e trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to study the geometry of large size-conditioned Bienaym\'e trees whose offspring distribution is subcritical, belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha=1$ and satisfies a local regularity assumption. We show that a condensation phenomenon occurs: one unique vertex of macroscopic degree emerges, and its height converges in distribution to a geometric random variable. Furthermore, the height of such trees grows logarithmically in their size. Interestingly, the behavior of subcritical Bienaym\'ee trees with $\alpha=1$ is quite similar to the case $\alpha \in( 1,2]$, in contrast with the critical case. This completes the study of the height of heavy-tailed size-conditioned Bienaym\'e trees.
  Our approach is to check that a random-walk one-big-jump principle due to Armend\'ariz &amp; Loulakis holds, by using local estimates due to Berger, combined with the previous approach to study subcritical Bienaym\'e trees with $\alpha&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Concentration via Metastable Mixing, with Applications to the Supercritical Exponential Random Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a folklore belief that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We prove a rigorous version of this phenomenon in the setting of the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. To do this, we first present a new general result deriving concentration inequalities in a metastable well from the metastable mixing of a Markov chain with the appropriate stationary distribution, extending a result of Chatterjee [Cha05] which is suited for more traditional forms of global mixing. We then apply this result to the supercritical (low-temperature) ERGM which was recently proven to exhibit metastable mixing by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani [BNN24], and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the supercritical ERGM conditioned on a large metastable well, answering a question posed by [BNN24]. This extends a result of Ganguly and Nam [GN24] from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to a metastable well in the supercritical regime, and we are also able to extend the applications of their concentration inequality to these metastable wells. Namely, we obtain an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM conditioned on a metastable well and an appropriate Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, as well as derive a central limit theorem for the count of edges in certain small subcollections of possible edges. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we also discuss the results of what appears to be the first simulation study of a metastable well in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of Two-Dimensional Random Band Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a random band matrix $H=(H_{xy})_{x,y}$ of dimension $N\times N$ with mean-zero complex Gaussian entries, where $x,y$ belong to the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z}/\sqrt{N}\mathbb{Z})^{2}$. The variance profile $\mathbb{E}|H_{xy}|^{2}=S_{xy}$ vanishes when the distance between $x,y$ is larger than some band-width parameter $W$ depending on $N$.
  We show that if the band-width satisfies $W\geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$ for some $\mathfrak{c}&gt;0$, then in the large-$N$ limit, we have the following results. The first result is a local semicircle law in the bulk down to scales $N^{-1+\varepsilon}$. The second is delocalization of bulk eigenvectors. The third is a quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors. The fourth is universality of local bulk eigenvalue statistics. The fifth is a quantum diffusion profile for the associated $T$ matrix.
  Our method is based on embedding $H$ inside a matrix Brownian motion $H_{t}$ as done in [Dubova-Yang '24] and [Yau-Yin '25] for band matrices on the one-dimensional torus. In this paper, the key additional ingredient in our analysis of $H_{t}$ is a new CLT-type estimate for polynomials in the entries of the resolvent of $H_{t}$.</description>

      <title>On Statistical Estimation of Edge-Reinforced Random Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforced random walks (RRWs), including vertex-reinforced random walks (VRRWs) and edge-reinforced random walks (ERRWs), model random walks where the transition probabilities evolve based on prior visitation history~\cite{mgr, fmk, tarres, volkov}. These models have found applications in various areas, such as network representation learning~\cite{xzzs}, reinforced PageRank~\cite{gly}, and modeling animal behaviors~\cite{smouse}, among others. However, statistical estimation of the parameters governing RRWs remains underexplored. This work focuses on estimating the initial edge weights of ERRWs using observed trajectory data. Leveraging the connections between an ERRW and a random walk in a random environment (RWRE)~\cite{mr, mr2}, as given by the so-called "magic formula", we propose an estimator based on the generalized method of moments. To analyze the sample complexity of our estimator, we exploit the hyperbolic Gaussian structure embedded in the random environment to bound the fluctuations of the underlying random edge conductances.</description>

Abstract: For $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, we prove convergence in distribution of the appropriately normalised partial sums \[ \frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{\substack{n \leq x \\ P(n) &gt; \sqrt{x}}} f(n), \] where $P(n)$ denotes the largest prime factor of $n$. We find that the limiting distribution is given by the square root of an integral with respect to a critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure multiplied by an independent standard complex normal random variable.</description>

      <title>Detecting correlation efficiently in stochastic block models: breaking Otter's threshold by counting decorated trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a pair of sparse correlated stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n},\epsilon;s)$ subsampled from a common parent stochastic block model with two symmetric communities, average degree $\lambda=O(1)$ and divergence parameter $\epsilon \in (0,1)$. For all $\epsilon\in(0,1)$, we construct a statistic based on the combination of two low-degree polynomials and show that there exists a sufficiently small constant $\delta=\delta(\epsilon)&gt;0$ and a sufficiently large constant $\Delta=\Delta(\epsilon,\delta)$ such that when $\lambda&gt;\Delta$ and $s&gt;\sqrt{\alpha}-\delta$ where $\alpha\approx 0.338$ is Otter's constant, this statistic can distinguish this model and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n},\epsilon)$ with probability $1-o(1)$. We also provide an efficient algorithm that approximates this statistic in polynomial time. The crux of our statistic's construction lies in a carefully curated family of multigraphs called \emph{decorated trees}, which enables effective aggregation of the community signal and graph correlation from the counts of the same decorated tree while suppressing the undesirable correlations among counts of different decorated trees.</description>

Abstract: Let Y be a random variable whose moment generating function exists in a neighborhood of the origin. The aim of this paper is to study the probabilistic degenerate poly-Bell polynomials associated with the random variable Y, arising from the degenerate polyexponential functions, which are probabilistic extensions of degenerate versions of the poly-Bell polynomials. We derive several explicit expressions and some related identities for them. In addition, we consider the special cases that Y is the Bernoulli random variable with probability of success p or the gamma random variable with parameters 1,1.</description>

      <title>Local inverse measure-theoretic entropy for endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of local inverse metric entropy along backward trajectories for ergodic measures preserved by endomorphisms (non-invertible maps) on a compact metric space. A second notion of inverse measure entropy is defined by using measurable partitions. Our notions have several useful applications. Inverse entropy can distinguish between isomorphism classes of endomorphisms on Lebesgue spaces, when they have the same forward measure-theoretic entropy. In a general setting we prove that the local inverse entropy of an ergodic measure \mu is equal to the forward entropy minus the folding entropy. The inverse entropy of hyperbolic measures on compact manifolds is explored, focusing on their negative Lyapunov exponents. We compute next the inverse entropy of the inverse SRB measure on a hyperbolic repellor. We prove an entropy rigidity result for special Anosov endomorphisms of \mathbb T^2, namely that they can be classified up to smooth conjugacy by knowing the entropy of their SRB measure and the inverse entropy of their inverse SRB measure. Next we study the relations between our inverse measure-theoretic entropy and the generalized topological inverse entropy on subsets of prehistories. In general we establish a Partial Variational Principle for inverse entropy. We obtain also a Full Variational Principle for inverse entropy in the case of special TA-covering maps on tori. In the end, several examples of endomorphisms are studied, such as fat baker transformations, fat solenoidal attractors, special Anosov endomorphisms, toral endomorphisms, and the local inverse entropy is computed for their SRB measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the generator of a conservative IID random system which expands on average codimension 1 planes has an essential spectral radius strictly smaller than $1$ on Sobolev spaces of small negative index. Consequently, such a system has finitely many ergodic components. If there is only one component for each power of the random system, then the system enjoys multiple exponential mixing and the central limit theorem. Moreover, these properties are stable under small perturbations. As an application we show that many small perturbations of random homogeneous systems are exponentially mixing.</description>

      <title>The level of self-organized criticality in oscillating Brownian motion: $n$-consistency and stable Poisson-type convergence of the MLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For some discretely observed path of oscillating Brownian motion with level of self-organized criticality $\rho_0$, we prove in the infill asymptotics that the MLE is $n$-consistent, where $n$ denotes the sample size, and derive its limit distribution with respect to stable convergence. As the transition density of this homogeneous Markov process is not even continuous in $\rho_0$, the analysis is highly non-standard. Therefore, interesting and somewhat unexpected phenomena occur: The likelihood function splits into several components, each of them contributing very differently depending on how close the argument $\rho$ is to $\rho_0$. Correspondingly, the MLE is successively excluded to lay outside a compact set, a $1/\sqrt{n}$-neighborhood and finally a $1/n$-neigborhood of $\rho_0$ asymptotically. The crucial argument to derive the stable convergence is to exploit the semimartingale structure of the sequential suitably rescaled local log-likelihood function (as a process in time). Both sequentially and as a process in $\rho$, it exhibits a bivariate Poissonian behavior in the stable limit with its intensity being a multiple of the local time at $\rho_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Epidemic Models with Partial Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models of epidemics often use compartmental models dividing the population into several compartments. Based on a microscopic setting describing the temporal evolution of the subpopulation sizes in the compartments by stochastic counting processes one can derive macroscopic models for large populations describing the average behavior by associated ordinary differential equations such as the celebrated SIR model. Further, diffusion approximations allow to address fluctuations from the average and to describe the state dynamics also for smaller populations by stochastic differential equations.
  In general, not all state variables are directly observable, and we face the so-called "dark figure" problem, which concerns, for example, the unknown number of asymptomatic and undetected infections. The present study addresses this problem by developing stochastic epidemic models that incorporate partial information about the current state of the epidemic, also known as nowcast uncertainty. Examples include a simple extension of the SIR model, a model for a disease with lifelong immunity after infection or vaccination, and a Covid-19 model. For the latter, we propose a ``cascade state approach'' that allows to exploit the information contained in formally hidden compartments with observable inflow but unobservable outflow. Furthermore, parameter estimation and calibration are performed using ridge regression for the Covid-19 model. The results of the numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $B=\{ B_{t}\} _{t\ge 0}$ be a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion. As an application of a recent result of ours on exponential functionals of Brownian motion, we show in this paper that, for every fixed $t&gt;0$, the process given by \begin{align*}
  B_{s}-B_{t}-\Bigl|
  B_{t}+\max _{0\le u\le s}B_{u}-\max _{s\le u\le t}B_{u}
  \Bigr|
  +\Bigl|
  \max _{0\le u\le s}B_{u}-\max _{s\le u\le t}B_{u}
  \Bigr| ,\quad 0\le s\le t, \end{align*} is a Brownian motion. The path transformation that describes the above process is proven to be an involution, commute with time reversal, and preserve Pitman's transformation. A connection with Pitman's $2M-X$ theorem is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Porous Medium Equation: Large Deviations and Gradient Flow with Degenerate and Unbounded Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of deriving a gradient flow structure for the porous medium equation which is {\em thermodynamic}, in that it arises from the large deviations of some microscopic particle system, is studied. To this end, a rescaled zero-range process with jump rate $g(k)=k^\alpha, \alpha&gt;1$ is considered, and its hydrodynamic limit and dynamical large deviations are shown in the presence of both degenerate and unbounded diffusion. The key superexponential estimate is obtained using pathwise discretised regularity estimates in the spirit of the Aubin-Lions-Simons lemma. This allows to exhibit the porous medium equation as the gradient flow of the entropy in a thermodynamic metric via the energy-dissipation inequality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve exit problems for a level-dependent L\'evy process which is exponentially killed with a killing intensity that depends on the present state of the process. Moreover, we analyse the respective resolvents. All identities are given in terms of new generalisations of scale functions (counterparts of the scale function from the theory of L\'evy processes), which are solutions of Volterra integral equations. Furthermore, we obtain similar results for the reflected level-dependent L\'evy processes. The existence of the solution of the stochastic differential equation for reflected level-dependent L\'evy processes is also discussed. Finally, to illustrate our result, the probability of bankruptcy is obtained for an insurance risk process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11832v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the first relationship between Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in the supercritical (a.k.a. strongly coupled) phase, which corresponds to central charge values $\mathbf c_{\mathrm L} \in (1,25)$ or equivalently to complex values of $\gamma$ with $|\gamma|=2$. More precisely, we introduce a canonical supercritical LQG surface with the topology of the disk. We then show that for each $\mathbf c_{\mathrm L} \in (1,25)$ there is a coupling of this LQG surface with a conformal loop ensemble with parameter $\kappa=4$ (CLE$_4$) wherein the LQG surfaces parametrized by the regions enclosed by the CLE$_4$ loops are conditionally independent supercritical LQG disks given their boundary lengths. In this coupling, the CLE$_4$ is neither determined by nor independent from the LQG. Guided by our coupling result, we exhibit a combinatorially natural family of loop-decorated random planar maps whose scaling limit we conjecture to be the supercritical LQG disk coupled to CLE$_4$. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Monotone duality of interacting particle systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The duality theory for monotone interacting particle systems was initiated by Gray (1986) and further developed by Sturm and Swart (2018). It contains the better known additive duality as a special case but differs in the sense that the dual process contains not only single particles but also pairs, triples, and general $n$-tuples of particles, which correspond to the fact that in the forward process sometimes several particles are needed to create one particle at a later time. In earlier work, the dual process was constructed for finite initial states only, but, assuming that the empty state is a trap for the forward process, we show that the dual process can be started in infinite initial states and has an upper invariant law. It can therefore be viewed as some sort of interacting particle system in its own right. For the monotone dual of a cooperative contact process, we show that the upper invariant law is the long-time limit started from any nontrivial homogeneous invariant law. We use this to prove continuity of the survival probability of the forward process as a function of its parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely-many neutral allelic model of population genetics where all alleles are divided into a finite number of classes, and each class is characterized by its own mutation rate. For this model the allelic composition of a sample taken from a very large population of genes is characterized by a random matrix, and the problem is to describe the joint distribution of the matrix entries. The answer is given by a new generalization of the classical Ewens sampling formula called the refined Ewens sampling formula in the present paper. We discuss a Poisson approximation for the refined Ewens sampling formula, and present its derivation by several methods. As an application we obtain limit theorems for the numbers of alleles in different asymptotic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a vertex-transitive graph of superlinear polynomial growth. Given $r&gt;0$, let $G_r$ be the graph on the same vertex set as $G$, with two vertices joined by an edge if and only if they are at graph distance at most $r$ apart in $G$. We show that the critical probability $p_c(G_r)$ for Bernoulli bond percolation on $G_r$ satisfies $p_c(G_r) \sim 1/\mathrm{deg}(G_r)$ as $r\to\infty$. This extends work of Penrose and Bollob\'as-Janson-Riordan, who considered the case $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$.
  Our result provides an important ingredient in parallel work of Georgakopoulos in which he introduces a new notion of dimension in groups. It also verifies a special case of a conjecture of Easo and Hutchcroft.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and uniqueness of solutions, as well as the ergodicity and exponential mixing to invariant measures, and limit theorems for a class of McKean-Vlasov SPDEs with locally weak monotonicity. In particular, for a class of weak monotonicity conditions, including H$\ddot{\text{o}}$lder continuity, we rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to McKean-Vlasov SPDEs by employing the Galerkin projection technique and the generalized coupling approach. Additionally, we explore the properties of the solutions, including time homogeneity, the Markov and the Feller property. Building upon these properties, we examine the exponential ergodicity and mixing of invariant measures under Lyapunov conditions. Finally, within the framework of coefficients meeting the criteria of locally weak monotonicity and Lyapunov conditions, alongside the uniform mixing property of invariant measures, we establish the strong law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the solution and obtain estimates of corresponding convergence rates.</description>

      <title>From clonal interference to Poissonian interacting trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00793v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a population whose size $N$ is fixed over the generations, and in which random beneficial mutations arrive at a rate of order $1/\log N$ per generation. In this so-called Gerrish--Lenski regime, typically a finite number of contending mutations are present together with one resident type. These mutations compete for fixation, a phenomenon addressed as clonal interference. We introduce and study a Poissonian system of interacting trajectories (PIT), and prove that it arises as a large population scaling limit of the logarithmic sizes of the contending clonal subpopulations in a continuous-time Moran model with strong selection. We show that the PIT exhibits an almost surely positive asymptotic rate of fitness increase (speed of adaptation), which turns out to be finite if and only if fitness increments have a finite expectation. We relate this speed to heuristic predictions from the literature. Furthermore, we derive a functional central limit theorem for the fitness of the resident population in the PIT.</description>

Abstract: We explore the connection between tasep-like interacting particle systems and last passage percolation type polymer models, focusing on three models: Geometric, Exponential and Brownian last passage percolation and their associated tasep particle systems. We explain how formulas for certain natural observables in last passage percolation translate to formulas for tasep, by going through a notion of "duality". In turn, we obtain determinantal formulas for last passage percolation with a deterministic boundary and for tasep with a deterministic first particle trajectory.</description>

      <title>Strategies in a mis\`ere two-player tree searching game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse a misere tree searching game, where players take turns to guess vertices in a tree with a secret `poisoned' vertex. After each turn, the guessed vertex is removed from the tree and the game continues on the component containing the poisoned vertex, and as soon as a player guesses the poisoned vertex, they lose. We describe and prove the solution when the game is played on a path graph, both between two optimal players and between a player who makes their decisions uniformly at random and an opponent who plays to exploit this. We show that, with two perfect players, the solution involves different guessing strategies depending on the value of n modulo 4. We then show that, with a random and an exploitative player, the probability that the exploitative player wins approaches a constant (approximately 0.599) as n increases, and that the vertices one away from the leaves of the path are always optimal guesses for them. We also solve the game played on a star graph, and briefly discuss the possibility for extending the analysis to more general trees.</description>

Abstract: In this note we consider the upper tail large deviations of subgraph counts for irregular graphs $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$, the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph on $n$ vertices with edge connectivity probability $p \in (0,1)$. For $n^{-1/\Delta} \ll p \ll 1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $\mathrm{H}$, we derive the upper tail large deviations for any irregular graph $\mathrm{H}$. On the other hand, we show that for $p$ such that $1 \ll n^{v_\mathrm{H}} p^{e_\mathrm{H}} \ll (\log n)^{\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}/\left(\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}-1\right)}$, where $v_\mathrm{H}$ and $e_\mathrm{H}$ denote the number of vertices and edges of $\mathrm{H}$, and $\alpha^*_{\mathrm{H}}$ denotes the fractional independence number, the upper tail large deviations of the number of unlabelled copies of $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ is given by that of a sequence of Poisson random variables with diverging mean. Restricting to the $r$-armed star graph we further prove a localized behavior in the intermediate range of $p$ (left open by the above two results) and show that the mean-field approximation is asymptotically tight for the logarithm of the upper tail probability.</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation: Multivariable Systems and Static Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5293</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.5293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Probability Bracket Notation (PBN) is used to analyze multiple discrete random variables in static Bayesian Networks (BN) through probabilistic graphical models. We briefly introduce the definitions of probability distributions in multivariable systems and their presentations using PBN, then explore the well-known student BN. Our analysis includes calculating various joint, marginal, intermediate, and conditional probability distributions, completing homework assignments, examining relationships between variables (dependence, independence, and conditional independence), and disclosing the power of and restrictions on inserting P-identity operators. We also show the reasoning capabilities of the Student BN using bottom-up and top-down approaches, validated by Elvira software. In the last section, we discuss BNs with continuous variables. After reviewing linear Gaussian networks, we introduce a customized Healthcare BN that includes continuous and discrete random variables, incorporates user-specific data, and offers tailored predictions through discrete-display (DD) nodes, serving as proxies for their continuous variable parents. Our investigation demonstrates that the PBN delivers a reliable and efficient approach for managing multiple variables in static Bayesian networks, a crucial aspect of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03033v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of a continuous-time optimization method, the \textit{Mean-Field Best Response} flow, for solving convex-concave min-max games with entropy regularization. We introduce suitable Lyapunov functions to establish exponential convergence to the unique mixed Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we demonstrate the convergence of the fictitious play flow as a by-product of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport: Existence and Multiplicity of Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal transport problem with quadratic regularization is useful when sparse couplings are desired. The density of the optimal coupling is described by two functions called potentials; equivalently, potentials can be defined as a solution of the dual problem. We prove the existence of potentials for a general square-integrable cost. Potentials are not necessarily unique, a phenomenon directly related to sparsity of the optimal support. For discrete problems, we describe the family of all potentials based on the connected components of the support, for a graph-theoretic notion of connectedness. On the other hand, we show that continuous problems have unique potentials under standard regularity assumptions, regardless of sparsity. Using potentials, we prove that the optimal support is indeed sparse for small regularization parameter in a continuous setting with quadratic cost, which seems to be the first theoretical guarantee for sparsity in this context.</description>

      <title>Almost-everywhere uniqueness of Lagrangian trajectories for $3$D Navier--Stokes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for any Leray solution $u$ to the $3$D Navier--Stokes equations with $u_0\in L^2$, the associated deterministic and stochastic Lagrangian trajectories are unique for Lebesgue a.e. initial condition. Additionally, if $u_0\in H^{1/2}$, then pathwise uniqueness is established for the stochastic Lagrangian trajectories starting from every initial condition. The result sharpens and extends the original one by Robinson and Sadowski (Nonlinearity 2009) and is based on rather different techniques. A key role is played by a newly established asymmetric Lusin--Lipschitz property of Leray solutions $u$, in the framework of (random) Regular Lagrangian flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems driven by non-linear parabolic partial differential equations with initial condition $\theta$ modelled by a Gaussian process `prior' probability measure. Given discrete samples of the state of the system evolving in space-time, one obtains updated `posterior' measures on a function space containing all possible trajectories. We give a general set of conditions under which these non-Gaussian posterior distributions are approximated, in Wasserstein distance for the supremum-norm metric, by the law of a Gaussian random function. We demonstrate the applicability of our results to periodic non-linear reaction diffusion equations \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u - \Delta u &amp;= f(u) \\ u(0) &amp;= \theta \end{align*} where $f$ is any smooth and compactly supported reaction function. In this case the limiting Gaussian measure can be characterised as the solution of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with `rough' Gaussian initial conditions whose covariance operator we describe.</description>

Abstract: We study projection determinantal point processes and their connection to the squared Grassmannian. We prove that the log-likelihood function of this statistical model has $(n - 1)!/2$ critical points, all of which are real and positive, thereby settling a conjecture of Devriendt, Friedman, Reinke, and Sturmfels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06070v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been a go-to algorithm for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems arising in machine learning. Its theory however often requires a strong framework to guarantee convergence properties. We hereby present a full scope convergence study of biased nonconvex SGD, including weak convergence, function-value convergence and global convergence, and also provide subsequent convergence rates and complexities, all under relatively mild conditions in comparison with literature.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Gaussianity of heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous diffusion processes are prevalent in various fields, including the motion of proteins in living cells, the migratory movement of birds and mammals, and finance. These processes are often characterized by time-varying dynamics, where interactions with the environment evolve, and the system undergoes fluctuations in diffusivity. Moreover, in many complex systems anomalous diffusion is observed, where the mean square displacement (MSD) exhibits non-linear scaling with time. Among the models used to describe this phenomenon, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely applied stochastic process, particularly for systems exhibiting long-range temporal correlations. Although FBM is characterized by Gaussian increments, heterogeneous processes with FBM-like characteristics may deviate from Gaussianity. In this article, we study the non-Gaussian behavior of switching fractional Brownian motion (SFBM), a model in which the diffusivity of the FBM process varies while temporal correlations are maintained. To characterize non-Gaussianity, we evaluate the kurtosis, a common tool used to quantify deviations from the normal distribution. We derive exact expressions for the kurtosis of the considered heterogeneous anomalous diffusion process and investigate how it can identify non-Gaussian behavior. We also compare the kurtosis results with those obtained using the Hellinger distance, a classical measure of divergence between probability density functions. Through both analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate the potential of kurtosis as a metric for detecting non-Gaussianity in heterogeneous anomalous diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations play a crucial role in balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling us to adjust decision granularity dynamically. Furthermore, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study employs CST in grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>
