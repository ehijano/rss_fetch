      <title>Team Coordination on Graphs: Problem, Analysis, and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Team Coordination on Graphs with Risky Edges (TCGRE) is a recently emerged problem, in which a robot team collectively reduces graph traversal cost through support from one robot to another when the latter traverses a risky edge. Resembling the traditional Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem, both classical and learning-based methods have been proposed to solve TCGRE, however, they lacked either computation efficiency or optimality assurance. In this paper, we reformulate TCGRE as a constrained optimization and perform rigorous mathematical analysis. Our theoretical analysis shows the NP-hardness of TCGRE by reduction from the Maximum 3D Matching problem and that efficient decomposition is a key to tackle this combinatorial optimization problem. Further more, we design three classes of algorithms to solve TCGRE, i.e., Joint State Graph (JSG) based, coordination based, and receding-horizon sub-team based solutions. Each of these proposed algorithms enjoy different provable optimality and efficiency characteristics that are demonstrated in our extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Ultra Low-Cost Two-Stage Multimodal System for Non-Normative Behavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The online community has increasingly been inundated by a toxic wave of harmful comments. In response to this growing challenge, we introduce a two-stage ultra-low-cost multimodal harmful behavior detection method designed to identify harmful comments and images with high precision and recall rates. We first utilize the CLIP-ViT model to transform tweets and images into embeddings, effectively capturing the intricate interplay of semantic meaning and subtle contextual clues within texts and images. Then in the second stage, the system feeds these embeddings into a conventional machine learning classifier like SVM or logistic regression, enabling the system to be trained rapidly and to perform inference at an ultra-low cost. By converting tweets into rich multimodal embeddings through the CLIP-ViT model and utilizing them to train conventional machine learning classifiers, our system is not only capable of detecting harmful textual information with near-perfect performance, achieving precision and recall rates above 99\% but also demonstrates the ability to zero-shot harmful images without additional training, thanks to its multimodal embedding input. This capability empowers our system to identify unseen harmful images without requiring extensive and costly image datasets. Additionally, our system quickly adapts to new harmful content; if a new harmful content pattern is identified, we can fine-tune the classifier with the corresponding tweets' embeddings to promptly update the system. This makes it well suited to addressing the ever-evolving nature of online harmfulness, providing online communities with a robust, generalizable, and cost-effective tool to safeguard their communities.</description>

      <title>Social Deliberation vs. Social Contracts in Self-Governing Voluntary Organisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organising multi-agent systems regulate their components' behaviour voluntarily, according to a set of socially-constructed, mutually-agreed, and mutable social arrangements. In some systems, these arrangements may be applied with a frequency, at a scale and within implicit cost constraints such that performance becomes a pressing issue. This paper introduces the \textit{Megabike Scenario}, which consists of a negotiated agreement on a relatively 'large' set of conventional rules, 'frequent' 'democratic' decision-making according to those rules, and a resource-bounded imperative to reach 'correct' decisions. A formalism is defined for effective rule representation and processing in the scenario, and is evaluated against five interleaved socio-functional requirements. System performance is also evaluated empirically through simulation. We conclude that to self-organise their social arrangements, agents need some awareness of their own limitations and the value of compromise.</description>

      <title>Norm Violation Detection in Multi-Agent Systems using Large Language Models: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Norms are an important component of the social fabric of society by prescribing expected behaviour. In Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), agents interacting within a society are equipped to possess social capabilities such as reasoning about norms and trust. Norms have long been of interest within the Normative Multi-Agent Systems community with researchers studying topics such as norm emergence, norm violation detection and sanctioning. However, these studies have some limitations: they are often limited to simple domains, norms have been represented using a variety of representations with no standard approach emerging, and the symbolic reasoning mechanisms generally used may suffer from a lack of extensibility and robustness. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer opportunities to discover and reason about norms across a large range of social situations. This paper evaluates the capability of LLMs to detecting norm violations. Based on simulated data from 80 stories in a household context, with varying complexities, we investigated whether 10 norms are violated. For our evaluations we first obtained the ground truth from three human evaluators for each story. Then, the majority result was compared against the results from three well-known LLM models (Llama 2 7B, Mixtral 7B and ChatGPT-4). Our results show the promise of ChatGPT-4 for detecting norm violations, with Mixtral some distance behind. Also, we identify areas where these models perform poorly and discuss implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Towards a Formalisation of Value-based Actions and Consequentialist Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents act to bring about a state of the world that is more compatible with their personal or institutional values. To formalise this intuition, the paper proposes an action framework based on the STRIPS formalisation. Technically, the contribution expresses actions in terms of Value-based Formal Reasoning (VFR), which provides a set of propositions derived from an Agent's value profile and the Agent's assessment of propositions with respect to the profile. Conceptually, the contribution provides a computational framework for a form of consequentialist ethics which is satisficing, luralistic, act-based, and preferential.</description>

      <title>Conformal Off-Policy Prediction for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-Policy Prediction (OPP), i.e., predicting the outcomes of a target policy using only data collected under a nominal (behavioural) policy, is a paramount problem in data-driven analysis of safety-critical systems where the deployment of a new policy may be unsafe. To achieve dependable off-policy predictions, recent work on Conformal Off-Policy Prediction (COPP) leverage the conformal prediction framework to derive prediction regions with probabilistic guarantees under the target process. Existing COPP methods can account for the distribution shifts induced by policy switching, but are limited to single-agent systems and scalar outcomes (e.g., rewards). In this work, we introduce MA-COPP, the first conformal prediction method to solve OPP problems involving multi-agent systems, deriving joint prediction regions for all agents' trajectories when one or more "ego" agents change their policies. Unlike the single-agent scenario, this setting introduces higher complexity as the distribution shifts affect predictions for all agents, not just the ego agents, and the prediction task involves full multi-dimensional trajectories, not just reward values. A key contribution of MA-COPP is to avoid enumeration or exhaustive search of the output space of agent trajectories, which is instead required by existing COPP methods to construct the prediction region. We achieve this by showing that an over-approximation of the true JPR can be constructed, without enumeration, from the maximum density ratio of the JPR trajectories. We evaluate the effectiveness of MA-COPP in multi-agent systems from the PettingZoo library and the F1TENTH autonomous racing environment, achieving nominal coverage in higher dimensions and various shift settings.</description>

      <title>LLMs-based Few-Shot Disease Predictions using EHR: A Novel Approach Combining Predictive Agent Reasoning and Critical Agent Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain valuable patient data for health-related prediction tasks, such as disease prediction. Traditional approaches rely on supervised learning methods that require large labeled datasets, which can be expensive and challenging to obtain. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert structured patient visit data (e.g., diagnoses, labs, prescriptions) into natural language narratives. We evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot performance of LLMs using various EHR-prediction-oriented prompting strategies. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach that utilizes LLM agents with different roles: a predictor agent that makes predictions and generates reasoning processes and a critic agent that analyzes incorrect predictions and provides guidance for improving the reasoning of the predictor agent. Our results demonstrate that with the proposed approach, LLMs can achieve decent few-shot performance compared to traditional supervised learning methods in EHR-based disease predictions, suggesting its potential for health-oriented applications.</description>

      <title>Balancing Fairness and Efficiency in Energy Resource Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bringing fairness to energy resource allocation remains a challenge, due to the complexity of system structures and economic interdependencies among users and system operators' decision-making. The rise of distributed energy resources has introduced more diverse heterogeneous user groups, surpassing the capabilities of traditional efficiency-oriented allocation schemes. Without explicitly bringing fairness to user-system interaction, this disparity often leads to disproportionate payments for certain user groups due to their utility formats or group sizes.
  Our paper addresses this challenge by formalizing the problem of fair energy resource allocation and introducing the framework for aggregators. This framework enables optimal fairness-efficiency trade-offs by selecting appropriate objectives in a principled way. By jointly optimizing over the total resources to allocate and individual allocations, our approach reveals optimized allocation schemes that lie on the Pareto front, balancing fairness and efficiency in resource allocation strategies.</description>

      <title>Transactive Local Energy Markets Enable Community-Level Resource Coordination Using Individual Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ALEX (Autonomous Local Energy eXchange) is an economy-driven, transactive local energy market where each participating building is represented by a rational agent. Relying solely on building-level information, this agent minimizes its electricity bill by automating distributed energy resource utilization and trading. This study examines ALEX's capabilities to align participant and grid-stakeholder interests and assesses ALEX's impact on short- and long-term intermittence using a set of community net-load metrics, such as ramping rate, load factor, and peak load. The policies for ALEX's rational agents are generated using dynamic programming through value iteration in conjunction with iterative best response. This facilitates comparing ALEX and a benchmark energy management system, which optimizes building-level self-consumption, ramping rate, and peak net load. Simulations are performed using the open-source CityLearn2022 dataset to provide a pathway for benchmarking by future studies. The experiments demonstrate that ALEX enables the coordination of distributed energy resources across the community. Remarkably, this community-level coordination occurs even though the system is populated by agents who only access building-level information and selfishly maximize their own relative profit. Compared to the benchmark energy management system, ALEX improves across all metrics.</description>

      <title>Optimized Model Selection for Estimating Treatment Effects from Costly Simulations of the US Opioid Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based simulation with a synthetic population can help us compare different treatment conditions while keeping everything else constant within the same population (i.e., as digital twins). Such population-scale simulations require large computational power (i.e., CPU resources) to get accurate estimates for treatment effects. We can use meta models of the simulation results to circumvent the need to simulate every treatment condition. Selecting the best estimating model at a given sample size (number of simulation runs) is a crucial problem. Depending on the sample size, the ability of the method to estimate accurately can change significantly. In this paper, we discuss different methods to explore what model works best at a specific sample size. In addition to the empirical results, we provide a mathematical analysis of the MSE equation and how its components decide which model to select and why a specific method behaves that way in a range of sample sizes. The analysis showed why the direction estimation method is better than model-based methods in larger sample sizes and how the between-group variation and the within-group variation affect the MSE equation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Affective Polarization: From Consensus to Partisan Divides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Politically divided societies are also often divided emotionally: people like and trust those with similar political views (in-group favoritism) while disliking and distrusting those with different views (out-group animosity). This phenomenon, called affective polarization, influences individual decisions, including seemingly apolitical choices such as whether to wear a mask or what car to buy. We present a dynamical model of decision-making in an affectively polarized society, identifying three potential global outcomes separated by a sharp boundary in the parameter space: consensus, partisan polarization, and non-partisan polarization. Analysis reveals that larger out-group animosity compared to in-group favoritism, i.e. more hate than love, is sufficient for polarization, while larger in-group favoritism compared to out-group animosity, i.e., more love than hate, is necessary for consensus. We also show that, counter-intuitively, increasing cross-party connections facilitates polarization, and that by emphasizing partisan differences, mass media creates self-fulfilling prophecies that lead to polarization. Affective polarization also creates tipping points in the opinion landscape where one group suddenly reverses their trends. Our findings aid in understanding and addressing the cascading effects of affective polarization, offering insights for strategies to mitigate polarization.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, simulations of pedestrians using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have been studied. This study considered the roads on a grid-world environment, and implemented pedestrians as MARL agents using an echo-state network and the least squares policy iteration method. Under this environment, the ability of these agents to learn to move forward by avoiding other agents was investigated. Specifically, we considered two types of tasks: the choice between a narrow direct route and a broad detour, and the bidirectional pedestrian flow in a corridor. The simulations results indicated that the learning was successful when the density of the agents was not that high.</description>

      <title>Effective Integration of Weighted Cost-to-go and Conflict Heuristic within Suboptimal CBS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11624v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is a popular multi-agent path finding (MAPF) solver that employs a low-level single agent planner and a high-level constraint tree to resolve conflicts. The vast majority of modern MAPF solvers focus on improving CBS by reducing the size of this tree through various strategies with few methods modifying the low level planner. Typically low level planners in existing CBS methods use an unweighted cost-to-go heuristic, with suboptimal CBS methods also using a conflict heuristic to help the high level search. In this paper, we show that, contrary to prevailing CBS beliefs, a weighted cost-to-go heuristic can be used effectively alongside the conflict heuristic in two possible variants. In particular, one of these variants can obtain large speedups, 2-100x, across several scenarios and suboptimal CBS methods. Importantly, we discover that performance is related not to the weighted cost-to-go heuristic but rather to the relative conflict heuristic weight's ability to effectively balance low-level and high-level work. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we show the first theoretical relation of prioritized planning and bounded suboptimal CBS and demonstrate that our methods are their natural generalization. Update March 2024: We found that the relative speedup decreases to around 1.2-10x depending on how the conflict heuristic is computed (see appendix for more details).</description>

      <title>A Traffic Management Framework for On-Demand Urban Air Mobility Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a solution to current traffic congestion by providing on-demand air mobility in urban areas. Effective traffic management is crucial for efficient operation of UAM systems, especially for high-demand scenarios. In this paper, we present a centralized traffic management framework for on-demand UAM systems. Specifically, we provide a scheduling policy, called VertiSync, which schedules the aircraft for either servicing trip requests or rebalancing in the system subject to aircraft safety margins and energy requirements. We characterize the system-level throughput of VertiSync, which determines the demand threshold at which passenger waiting times transition from being stabilized to being increasing over time. We show that the proposed policy is able to maximize throughput for sufficiently large fleet sizes. We demonstrate the performance of VertiSync through a case study for the city of Los Angeles, and show that it significantly reduces passenger waiting times compared to a first-come first-serve scheduling policy.</description>

      <title>Robust Integral Consensus Control of Multi-Agent Networks Perturbed by Matched and Unmatched Disturbances: The Case of Directed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new method to design consensus controllers for perturbed double integrator systems whose interconnection is described by a directed graph containing a rooted spanning tree. We propose new robust controllers to solve the consensus and synchronization problems when the systems are under the effects of matched and unmatched disturbances. In both problems, we present simple continuous controllers, whose integral actions allow us to handle the disturbances. A rigorous stability analysis based on Lyapunov's direct method for unperturbed networked systems is presented. To assess the performance of our result, a representative simulation study is presented.</description>

Abstract: Sensor network localization (SNL) problems require determining the physical coordinates of all sensors in a network. This process relies on the global coordinates of anchors and the available measurements between non-anchor and anchor nodes. Attributed to the intrinsic non-convexity, obtaining a globally optimal solution to SNL is challenging, as well as implementing corresponding algorithms. In this paper, we formulate a non-convex multi-player potential game for a generic SNL problem to investigate the identification condition of the global Nash equilibrium (NE) therein, where the global NE represents the global solution of SNL. We employ canonical duality theory to transform the non-convex game into a complementary dual problem. Then we develop a conjugation-based algorithm to compute the stationary points of the complementary dual problem. On this basis, we show an identification condition of the global NE: the stationary point of the proposed algorithm satisfies a duality relation. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Carbon Footprint Reduction for Sustainable Data Centers in Real-Time</title>

Abstract: As machine learning workloads significantly increase energy consumption, sustainable data centers with low carbon emissions are becoming a top priority for governments and corporations worldwide. This requires a paradigm shift in optimizing power consumption in cooling and IT loads, shifting flexible loads based on the availability of renewable energy in the power grid, and leveraging battery storage from the uninterrupted power supply in data centers, using collaborative agents. The complex association between these optimization strategies and their dependencies on variable external factors like weather and the power grid carbon intensity makes this a hard problem. Currently, a real-time controller to optimize all these goals simultaneously in a dynamic real-world setting is lacking. We propose a Data Center Carbon Footprint Reduction (DC-CFR) multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that optimizes data centers for the multiple objectives of carbon footprint reduction, energy consumption, and energy cost. The results show that the DC-CFR MARL agents effectively resolved the complex interdependencies in optimizing cooling, load shifting, and energy storage in real-time for various locations under real-world dynamic weather and grid carbon intensity conditions. DC-CFR significantly outperformed the industry standard ASHRAE controller with a considerable reduction in carbon emissions (14.5%), energy usage (14.4%), and energy cost (13.7%) when evaluated over one year across multiple geographical regions.</description>
