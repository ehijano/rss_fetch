      <title>Equilibrium Computation in the Hotelling-Downs Model of Spatial Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hotelling-Downs model is a natural and appealing model for understanding strategic positioning by candidates in elections. In this model, voters are distributed on a line, representing their ideological position on an issue. Each candidate then chooses as a strategy a position on the line to maximize her vote share. Each voter votes for the nearest candidate, closest to their ideological position. This sets up a game between the candidates, and we study pure Nash equilibria in this game. The model and its variants are an important tool in political economics, and are studied widely in computational social choice as well.
  Despite the interest and practical relevance, most prior work focuses on the existence and properties of pure Nash equilibria in this model, ignoring computational issues. Our work gives algorithms for computing pure Nash equilibria in the basic model. We give three algorithms, depending on whether the distribution of voters is continuous or discrete, and similarly, whether the possible candidate positions are continuous or discrete. In each case, our algorithms return either an exact equilibrium or one arbitrarily close to exact, assuming existence. We believe our work will be useful, and may prompt interest, in computing equilibria in the wide variety of extensions of the basic model as well.</description>

      <title>Improving Cooperation in Language Games with Bayesian Inference and the Cognitive Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-player cooperative games, agents can play together effectively when they have accurate assumptions about how their teammate will behave, but may perform poorly when these assumptions are inaccurate. In language games, failure may be due to disagreement in the understanding of either the semantics or pragmatics of an utterance. We model coarse uncertainty in semantics using a prior distribution of language models and uncertainty in pragmatics using the cognitive hierarchy, combining the two aspects into a single prior distribution over possible partner types. Fine-grained uncertainty in semantics is modeled using noise that is added to the embeddings of words in the language. To handle all forms of uncertainty we construct agents that learn the behavior of their partner using Bayesian inference and use this information to maximize the expected value of a heuristic function. We test this approach by constructing Bayesian agents for the game of Codenames, and show that they perform better in experiments where semantics is uncertain</description>

      <title>Raising Bidders' Awareness in Second-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When bidders bid on complex objects, they might be unaware of characteristics effecting their valuations. We assume that each buyer's valuation is a sum of independent random variables, one for each characteristic. When a bidder is unaware of a characteristic, he omits the random variable from the sum. We study the seller's decision to raise bidders' awareness of characteristics before a second-price auction with entry fees. Optimal entry fees capture an additional unawareness rent due to unaware bidders misperceiving their probability of winning and the price to be paid upon winning. When raising a bidder's individual awareness of a characteristic with positive expected value, the seller faces a trade-off between positive effects on the expected first order statistic and unawareness rents of remaining unaware bidders on one hand and the loss of the unawareness rent from the newly aware bidder on the other. We present characterization results on raising public awareness together with no versus full information. We discuss the winner's curse due to unawareness of characteristics.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Learning Algorithms in Bayesian Auction Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium problems in Bayesian auction games can be described as systems of differential equations. Depending on the model assumptions, these equations might be such that we do not have a rigorous mathematical solution theory. The lack of analytical or numerical techniques with guaranteed convergence for the equilibrium problem has plagued the field and limited equilibrium analysis to rather simple auction models such as single-object auctions. Recent advances in equilibrium learning led to algorithms that find equilibrium under a wide variety of model assumptions. We analyze first- and second-price auctions where simple learning algorithms converge to an equilibrium. The equilibrium problem in auctions is equivalent to solving an infinite-dimensional variational inequality (VI). Monotonicity and the Minty condition are the central sufficient conditions for learning algorithms to converge to an equilibrium in such VIs. We show that neither monotonicity nor pseudo- or quasi-monotonicity holds for the respective VIs. The second-price auction's equilibrium is a Minty-type solution, but the first-price auction is not. However, the Bayes--Nash equilibrium is the unique solution to the VI within the class of uniformly increasing bid functions, which ensures that gradient-based algorithms attain the equilibrium in case of convergence, as also observed in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>Can Almost Everybody be Almost Happy? PCP for PPAD and the Inapproximability of Nash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:1504.02411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that PPAD has a PCP-like complete problem, seeking a near equilibrium in which all but very few players have very little incentive to deviate. We show that, if one assumes that this problem requires exponential time, several open problems in this area are settled. The most important implication, proved via a "birthday repetition" reduction, is that the n^O(log n) approximation scheme of [LMM03] for the Nash equilibrium of two-player games is essentially optimum. Two other open problems in the area are resolved once one assumes this conjecture, establishing that certain approximate equilibria are PPAD-complete: Finding a relative approximation of two-player Nash equilibria (without the well-supported restriction of [Das13]), and an approximate competitive equilibrium with equal incomes [Bud11] with small clearing error and near-optimal Gini coefficient.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Misalignment Between Agents: Towards a Sociotechnical Understanding of Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing work on the alignment problem has focused mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a monolith. Recent sociotechnical approaches highlight the need to understand complex misalignment among multiple human and AI agents. We address this gap by adapting a computational social science model of human contention to the alignment problem. Our model quantifies misalignment in large, diverse agent groups with potentially conflicting goals across various problem areas. Misalignment scores in our framework depend on the observed agent population, the domain in question, and conflict between agents' weighted preferences. Through simulations, we demonstrate how our model captures intuitive aspects of misalignment across different scenarios. We then apply our model to two case studies, including an autonomous vehicle setting, showcasing its practical utility. Our approach offers enhanced explanatory power for complex sociotechnical environments and could inform the design of more aligned AI systems in real-world applications.</description>
