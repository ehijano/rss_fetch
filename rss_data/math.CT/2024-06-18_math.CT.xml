      <title>Enriched aspects of calculus of relations and $2$-permutability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to further develop the calculus of (internal) relations for a regular Ord-category C. To capture the enriched features of a regular Ord-category and obtain a good calculus, the relations we work with are precisely the ideals in C. We then focus on an enriched version of the 1-dimensional algebraic 2-permutable (also called Mal'tsev) property and its well-known equivalent characterisations expressed through properties on ordinary relations. We introduce the notion of Ord-Mal'tsev category and show that these may be characterised through enriched versions of the above mentioned properties adapted to ideals. Any Ord-enrichment of a 1-dimensional Mal'tsev category is necessarily an Ord-Mal'tsev category. We also give some examples of categories which are not Mal'tsev categories, but are Ord-Mal'tsev categories.</description>

      <title>Bundles of metric structures as left ultrafunctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue the study of Ultracategories initiated by Makkai and more recently Lurie by looking at properties of Ultracategories of complete metric structures, i.e. coming from continuous model theory, instead of ultracategories of models of first order theories. Our main result is that for any continuous theory $\mathbb{T}$, there is an equivalence between the category of left ultrafunctors from a compact Hausdorff space $X$ to the category of $\mathbb{T}$-models and a notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models over $X$. The notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models is new but recovers many classical notions like Bundle of Banach spaces, or (semi)-continuous field of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras or Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy simplicial sets and their application to geometric data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we expand upon the concepts introduced in \cite{Spivak09} about the relationship between the category $\mathbf{UM}$ of uber metric spaces and the category $\mathbf{sFuz}$ of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that fuzzy simplicial sets can be regarded as natural combinatorial generalizations of metric relations. Furthermore, we take inspiration from UMAP to apply the theory to dimension reduction (manifold learning) and data visualization, while refining some of their constructions to put the corresponding theory on a more solid footing. A generalization of the adjunction between $\mathbf{UM}$ and $\mathbf{sFuz}$ will allow us to view the adjunctions used in both publications as special cases. Moreover, we derive an explicit description of colimits in $\mathbf{UM}$ and the realization functor $\text{Re}:\mathbf{sFuz}\to\mathbf{UM}$, as well as rigorous definitions of functors that make it possible to recursively merge sets of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that $\mathbf{UM}$ and the category of extended-pseudo metric spaces $\mathbf{EPMet}$ can be embedded into $\mathbf{sFuz}$ and provide a description of the adjunctions between the category of truncated fuzzy simplicial sets and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, which we relate to persistent homology. Combining those constructions, we can show a surprising connection between the well-known dimension reduction methods UMAP and Isomap and derive an alternative algorithm, which we call IsUMap, that combines some of the strengths of both methods. We compare it with UMAP and Isomap and provide explanations for observed differences.</description>

      <title>Symmetric monoidal categories of conveniently-constructible Banach bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a continuously-normed Banach bundle $\mathcal{E}$ over a compact Hausdorff space $X$ whose space of sections is algebraically finitely-generated (f.g.) over $C(X)$ is locally trivial (and hence the section space is projective f.g over $C(X)$); this answers a question of I. Gogi{\'c}. As a preliminary we also provide sufficient conditions for a quotient bundle to be continuous phrased in terms of the Vietoris continuity of the unit-ball maps attached to the bundles. Related results include (a) the fact that the category of topologically f.g. continuous Banach bundles over $X$ form a symmetric monoidal category under the (fiber-wise-maximal) tensor product, (b) the full faithfulness of the global-section functor from topologically f.g. continuous bundles to $C(X)$-modules and (c) the consequent identification of the algebraically f.g. bundles as precisely the rigid objects in the aforementioned symmetric monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Exact dg categories II : The embedding theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an exact dg category $\mathcal A$, we introduce its bounded dg derived category $\mathcal{D}^b_{dg}(\mathcal A)$ and establish the universal exact morphism from $\mathcal A$ to $\mathcal{D}^b_{dg}(\mathcal A)$. We prove that the dg quotient of an exact dg category by a subcategory of projective-injectives carries a canonical exact structure. We show that exact dg categories reproduce under tensor products and functor dg categories. We apply our results to 0-Auslander extriangulated categories and confirm a conjecture by Fang-Gorsky-Palu-Plamondon-Pressland for the algebraic case.</description>

      <title>Magnitude homology equivalence of Euclidean sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnitude homology is an $\mathbf{R}^+$-graded homology theory of metric spaces that captures information on the complexity of geodesics. Here we address the question: when are two metric spaces magnitude homology equivalent, in the sense that there exist back-and-forth maps inducing mutually inverse maps in homology? We give a concrete geometric necessary and sufficient condition in the case of closed Euclidean sets. Along the way, we introduce the convex-geometric concepts of inner boundary and core, and prove a strengthening for closed convex sets of the classical theorem of Carath\'eodory.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Neural Network Symmetrisation in Markov Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks into $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible, compositional, and generic framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing methods for deterministic symmetrisation as special cases, and extends directly to provide a novel methodology for stochastic symmetrisation also. Beyond this, we believe our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing problems in machine learning in a conceptual yet mathematically rigorous way.</description>

      <title>The category of $\pi$-finite spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the category of truncated spaces with finite homotopy invariants ($\pi$\=/finite spaces) has many of the features expected of an elementary \oo topos. It should be thought of as the natural higher analogue of the elementary 1-topos of finite sets. We prove several initiality results for this \oo category. The paper has also an appendix about univalent families in \oo pretopoi.</description>

      <title>Enriched universal algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the classical approach of Birkhoff, we suggest an enriched version of enriched universal algebra. Given a suitable base of enrichment $\mathcal V$, we define a language $\mathbb L$ to be a collection of $(X,Y)$-ary function symbols whose arities are taken among the objects of $\mathcal V$. The class of $\mathbb L$-terms is constructed recursively from the symbols of $\mathbb L$, the morphisms in $\mathcal V$, and by incorporating the monoidal structure of $\mathcal V$. Then, $\mathbb L$-structures and interpretations of terms are defined, leading to enriched equational theories. In this framework we characterize algebras for finitary monads on $\mathcal V$ as models of an equational theories.</description>

      <title>The local-to-global principle via topological properties of the tensor triangular support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the theory of tensor triangular support introduced by Sanders, which generalizes the Balmer-Favi support, we prove the local version of the result of Zou that the Balmer spectrum being Hochster weakly scattered implies the local-to-global principle.
  That is, given an object $t$ of a tensor triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ we show that if the tensor triangular support $\text{Supp}(t)$ is a weakly scattered subset with respect to the inverse topology of the Balmer spectrum $\text{Spc}(\mathcal{T}^c)$, then the local-to-global principle holds for $t$.
  As immediate consequences, we have the analogue adaptations of the well-known statements that the Balmer spectrum being noetherian or Hausdorff scattered implies the local-to-global principle.
  We conclude with an application of the last result to the examination of the support of injective superdecomposable modules in the derived category of an absolutely flat ring which is not semi-artinian.</description>
