      <title>Exterior boundary-value Poincare problem for elliptic systems of the second order with two independent variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a number of examples showing that in the case of two independent variables the uniform ellipticity of a linear system of differential equations with partial derivatives of the second order, which fulfills condition (3), do not always cause the normal solvability of formulated exterior elliptic problems in the sense of Noether. Nevertheless, from the system of differential equations with partial derivatives of elliptic type it is possible to choose, under certain additional conditions, classes which are normally solvable in the sense of Noether. This paper also shows that for the so-called decomposed system of differential equations, with partial derivatives of an elliptic type in the case of exterior regions, the Noether theorems are valid.</description>

      <title>The explicit solution of linear, dissipative, second-order initial-boundary value problems with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive explicit solution representations for linear, dissipative, second-order Initial-Boundary Value Problems (IBVPs) with coefficients that are spatially varying, with linear, constant-coefficient, two-point boundary conditions. We accomplish this by considering the variable-coefficient problem as the limit of a constant-coefficient interface problem, previously solved using the Unified Transform Method of Fokas. Our method produces an explicit representation of the solution, allowing us to determine properties of the solution directly. As explicit examples, we demonstrate the solution procedure for different IBVPs of variations of the heat equation, and the linearized complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation (periodic boundary conditions). We can use this to find the eigenvalues of dissipative second-order linear operators (including non-self-adjoint ones) as roots of a transcendental function, and we can write their eigenfunctions explicitly in terms of the eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Boundedness in a two-dimensional doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the no-flux initial-boundary value problem for the doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system \begin{align} \begin{cases}\tag{$\star$}\label{eq 0.1} u_t=\nabla \cdot(u v \nabla u)-\chi \nabla \cdot\left(u^{2} v \nabla v\right)+\ell u v, &amp; x \in \Omega, t&gt;0, \\ v_t=\Delta v-u v, &amp; x \in \Omega, t&gt;0 \end{cases} \end{align} in a smoothly bounded convex domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, where $\chi&gt;0$ and $\ell \geq 0$. In this paper, we present that for all reasonably regular initial data, the model \eqref{eq 0.1} possesses a global bounded weak solution which is continuous in its first and essentially smooth in its second component. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Upscaled equations for the Fokker-Planck diffusion through arrays of permeable and of impermeable inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Fokker-Planck diffusion equation with diffusion coefficient depending periodically on the space variable. Inside a periodic array of inclusions the diffusion coefficient is reduced by a factor called the diffusion magnitude. We find the upscaled equations obtained by taking both the degeneration and the homogenization limits in which the diffusion magnitude and the scale of the periodicity tends, respectively, to zero. Different behaviors, classified as pure diffusion, diffusion with mass deposition, and absence of diffusion, are found depending on the order in which the two limits are taken and on the ratio between the size of the inclusions and the scale of the periodicity.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of weak solutions to 2D generalized Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-uniqueness of weak solutions for the two-dimensional hyper-dissipative Navier-Stokes equations in the super-critical spaces $L_{t}^{\gamma}L_{x}^{p}$ when $\alpha\in[1,\frac{3}{2})$, and obtain the conclusion that the non-uniqueness of the weak solutions at the endpoint $(\gamma,p)=(\infty, \frac{2}{2\alpha-1})$ is sharp in view of the generalized Lady\v{z}enskaja-Prodi-Serrin condition by using a different spatial-temporal building block from [Cheskidov-Luo, Ann. PDE, 9:13 (2023)] and taking advantage of the intermittency of the temporal concentrated function $g_{(k)}$ in an almost optimal way. Our results recover the above 2D non-uniqueness conclusion and extend to the hyper-dissipative case $\alpha \in(1,\frac{3}{2})$.</description>

      <title>On the Cahn-Hilliard equation with kinetic rate dependent dynamic boundary condition and non-smooth potential: separation property and long-time behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of Cahn-Hilliard equation that characterizes phase separation phenomena of binary mixtures in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ $(d\in \{2,3\})$ with non-permeable boundary. The equations in the bulk are subject to kinetic rate dependent dynamic boundary conditions with possible boundary diffusion acting on the boundary chemical potential. For the initial boundary value problem with singular potentials, we prove that any global weak solution exhibits a propagation of regularity in time. In the two dimensional case, we establish the instantaneous strict separation property by a suitable De Giorgi's iteration scheme, which yields that the weak solution stays uniformly away from the pure phases $\pm 1$ from any positive time on. In particular, when the bulk and boundary chemical potentials are in equilibrium, we obtain the instantaneous separation property with or without possible boundary diffusion acting on the boundary chemical potential. Next, in the three dimensional case, we show the eventual strict separation property that holds after a sufficiently large time. These separation properties are obtained in an unified way with respect to the structural parameters. Moreover, they allow us to achieve higher-order regularity of the global weak solution and prove the convergence to a single equilibrium as $t \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions for a system with general Hardy--Sobolev singular criticalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of Hardy--Sobolev type systems defined in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and coupled by a singular critical Hardy--Sobolev term. The main novelty of this work is that the orders of the singularities are independent and contained in a wide range. By means of variational techniques, we will prove the existence of positive bound and ground states for such a system. In particular, we find solutions as minimizers or Mountain--Pass critical points of the energy functional on the underlying Nehari manifold.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions to k-Wave models of nonlinear ultrasound propagation in biological tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate models for nonlinear ultrasound propagation in soft biological tissue based on the one that serves as the core for the software package k-Wave. The systems are solved for the acoustic particle velocity, mass density, and acoustic pressure and involve a fractional absorption operator. We first consider a system that incorporates additional viscosity in the equation for momentum conservation. By constructing a Galerkin approximation procedure, we prove the local existence of its solutions. In view of inverse problems arising from imaging tasks, the theory allows for the variable background mass density, speed of sound, and the nonlinearity parameter in the systems. Secondly, under stronger conditions on the data, we take the vanishing viscosity limit of the problem, thereby rigorously establishing the existence of solutions for the limiting system as well.</description>

      <title>Uniform asymptotic stability of a PDE's system arising from a flexible robotics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the asymptotic stability of a fourth-order PDE with a fading memory forcing term and boundary conditions arising from a flexible robotics model. We carry on our study by using an abstract formulation of the problem based on the $C_0$-semigroup. To achieve our objective, we first provide new results on the existence, uniqueness, continuous dependence on initial data of either mild and strong solutions for semilinear integro-differential equations in Banach spaces. Then, we also find sufficient conditions for the uniform asymptotic stability of solutions and for the existence of attactors. As an application of these abstract results, we can ensure existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on initial data for the solutions of the boundary value problem under investigation and, finally, we prove the uniform asymptotic stability of solutions and the existence of attactors under suitable conditions on the nonlinear term.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in reiterated periodic homogenization for a family of parabolic problems with nonstandard growth monotone operators leading to Orlicz spaces. The aim of this work is the determination of the global homogenized problem on the one hand and the macroscopic homogenized problem on the other hand, via the reiterated two-scale convergence method adapted to this type of spaces.</description>

      <title>Principle of structural analogy of solutions and its application to nonlinear PDEs and delay PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the principle of structural analogy of solutions, approaches have been developed for constructing exact solutions of complex nonlinear PDEs, including PDEs with delay, based on the use of special solutions to auxiliary simpler related equations. It is shown that to obtain exact solutions of nonlinear non-autonomous PDEs, the coefficients of which depend on time, it is possible to use generalized and functional separable solutions of simpler autonomous PDEs, the coefficients of which do not depend on time. Specific examples of constructing exact solutions to nonlinear PDEs, the coefficients of which depend arbitrarily on time, are considered. It has been discovered that generalized and functional separable solutions of nonlinear PDEs with constant delay can be used to construct exact solutions of more complex nonlinear PDEs with variable delay of general form. A number of nonlinear reaction-diffusion type PDEs with variable delay are described, which allow exact solutions with generalized separation of variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove $\varepsilon$-regularity theorems for varifolds with capillary boundary condition in a Riemannian manifold. These varifolds were first introduced by Kagaya-Tonegawa \cite{KaTo}. We establish a uniform first variation control for all such varifolds (and free-boundary varifolds generally) satisfying a sharp density bound and prove that if a capillary varifold has bounded mean curvature and is close to a capillary half-plane with angle not equal to $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$, then it coincides with a $C^{1,\alpha}$ properly embedded hypersurface. We apply our theorem to deduce regularity at a generic point along the boundary in the region where the density is strictly less than $1$.</description>

      <title>Modulation theory of soliton-mean flow in KdV equation with box type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the KdV equation with box type initial data, the interaction between a trial soliton and large-scale dispersive mean flow is studied theoretically and numerically. The pure box initial value can cause rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave, and can create an area of soliton train. The key to the interaction of soliton and mean flow is that the dynamic evolutions of the mean flow and the local soliton can be described by the same modulation system. The soliton modulation system is derived from the degenerations of the two-genus Whitham modulation system. Considering the influence of rarefaction wave, dispersive shock wave and soliton train on the trial soliton, in the framework of Whitham modulation theory, the equation describing the soliton trajectory and the changes in amplitude and phase shift are given explicitly. The predicted results are compared with the numerical simulations, which verifies the corrections of the theoretical analysis. The exotic interaction phenomena between soliton and mean flow found in this work have broad applications to shallow water soliton propagations and real soliton experiments in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1991, Moore [20] raised a question about whether hydrodynamics is capable of performing computations. Similarly, in 2016, Tao [25] asked whether a mechanical system, including a fluid flow, can simulate a universal Turing machine. In this expository article, we review the construction in [8] of a "Fluid computer" in dimension 3 that combines techniques in symbolic dynamics with the connection between steady Euler flows and contact geometry unveiled by Etnyre and Ghrist. In addition, we argue that the metric that renders the vector field Beltrami cannot be critical in the Chern-Hamilton sense [9]. We also sketch the completely different construction for the Euclidean metric in $\mathbb R^3$ as given in [7]. These results reveal the existence of undecidable fluid particle paths. We conclude the article with a list of open problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper the inverse problem of determining the fractional orders in mixed-type equations is considered. In one part of the domain the considered equation is the subdiffusion equation with a fractional derivative in the sense of Gerasimov-Caputo of the order 0&lt;a&lt;1 , and in the other part - a wave equation with a fractional derivative of the order 1&lt;b&lt;2 . The elliptic part of the equation is a second-order operator, considered in a N - dimensional domain D. Assuming the parameters a and b to be unknown, additional conditions are found that provide an unambiguous determination of the required parameters.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly Elastic Maps: Energy Minimizing Configurations of Membranes on Prescribed Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02070v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model for nonlinearly elastic membranes undergoing finite deformations while confined to a regular frictionless surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a physically correct model of the analogy sometimes given to motivate harmonic maps between manifolds. The proposed energy density function is convex in the strain pair comprising the deformation gradient and the local area ratio. If the target surface is a plane, the problem reduces to 2-dimensional, polyconvex nonlinear elasticity addressed by J.M. Ball. On the other hand, the energy density is not rank-one convex for unconstrained deformations into $\mathbb{R}^3$. We show that the problem admits an energy-minimizing configuration when constrained to lie on the given surface. For a class of Dirichlet problems, we demonstrate that the minimizing deformation is a homeomorphism onto its image on the given surface and establish the weak Eulerian form of the equilibrium equations.</description>

      <title>On the number and geometric location of critical points of solutions to a semilinear elliptic equation in annular domains</title>

Abstract: In this paper, one of our aims is to investigate the instability of the distribution of the critical point set $\mathcal{C}(u)$ of a solution $u$ to a semilinear equation with Dirichlet boundary condition in the planar annular domains. Precisely, we prove that $\mathcal{C}(u)$ in an eccentric circle annular domain, or a petal-like domain, or an annular domain where the interior and exterior boundaries are equally scaled ellipses contains only finitely many points rather than a Jordan curve. This result indicates that the critical point set $\mathcal{C}(u)$ is unstable when any boundary of planar concentric circle annular domain $\Omega$ has some small deformation or minor perturbation. Based on studying the distribution of the nodal sets $u^{-1}_\theta(0)(u_\theta=\nabla u\cdot \theta)$ and $u^{-1}(0)$, we prove that the solution $u$ on each symmetric axis has exactly two critical points under some conditions. Meanwhile, we further obtain that $\mathcal{C}(u)$ only has two critical points in an eccentric circle annular domain, has four critical points in an exterior petal-like domain with the exterior boundary $\gamma_E$ is an ellipse, and the maximum points are distributed on the long symmetric semi-axis and the saddle points on the short symmetric semi-axis. Moreover, we describe the geometric location of critical points of the solution $u$ by the moving plane method.</description>

Abstract: Image inpainting involves filling in damaged or missing regions of an image by utilizing information from the surrounding areas. In this paper, we investigate a highly nonlinear partial differential equation inspired by the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation. Instead of using standard potentials that depend solely on pixel intensities, we consider morphological image enhancement filters that are based on a variant of the shock filter: : \begin{align*} \partial_t u &amp;= \Delta \left(-\nu \arctan(\Delta u)|\nabla u| - \mu \Delta u \right)+ \lambda(u_0 - u). \end{align*} This is referred to as the Shock Filter Cahn-Hilliard Equation. This equation is nonlinear with respect to the second-order derivative, which poses significant mathematical challenges. To address these, we make use of a specific approximation argument, establishing the existence of a family of approximate solutions through the Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem and the Aubin-Lions lemma. In the limit, we obtain a solution strategy wherein we can prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Proving the latter involves the use of Young measures and Kruzhkov entropy type-admissibility conditions. Additionally, we use a numerical method based on the convexity splitting idea to approximate solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equation and achieve fast inpainting results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our method to standard binary images and compare it with variations of the Cahn-Hilliard equation commonly used in the field.</description>

      <title>Kiselman Minimum Principle and Rooftop Envelopes in Complex Hessian Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of $m$-subharmonic functions with respect to a semipositive $(1,1)$-form in Euclidean domains, providing a significant element in understanding geodesics within the context of complex Hessian equations. Based on the foundational Perron envelope construction, we prove a decomposition of $m$-subharmonic solutions, and a general comparison principle that effectively manages singular Hessian measures. Additionally, we establish a rooftop equality and an analogue of the Kiselman minimum principle, which are crucial ingredients in establishing a criterion for geodesic connectivity among $m$-subharmonic functions, expressed in terms of their asymptotic envelopes.</description>
