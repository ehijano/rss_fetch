      <title>Discrete Lanchester attrition models: the case of precautionary surrender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete Lanchester-type attrition models describe many types of antagonistic situations; the preferred interpretation is two fleets of battleships, each trying to sink the other. Such models may be characterised by a bivariate recurrence relation. Here I consider a restricted case in which a fleet that finds itself two or three units behind its opponent immediately surrenders. I present some theoretical and numerical results and suggest lines for further work.</description>

      <title>Effect of antibody levels on the spread of disease in multiple infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are complex interactions between antibody levels and epidemic propagation, the antibody level of an individual influences the probability of infection, and the spread of the virus influences the antibody level of each individual. There exist some viruses that, in their natural state, cause antibody levels in an infected individual to gradually decay. When these antibody levels decay to a certain point, the individual can be reinfected, such as with COVID 19. To describe their interaction, we introduce a novel mathematical model that incorporates the presence of an antibody retention rate to investigate the infection patterns of individuals who survive multiple infections. The model is composed of a system of stochastic differential equations to derive the equilibrium point and threshold of the model and presents rich experimental results of numerical simulations to further elucidate the propagation properties of the model. We find that the antibody decay rate strongly affects the propagation process, and also that different network structures have different sensitivities to the antibody decay rate, and that changes in the antibody decay rate cause stronger changes in the propagation process in Barabasi Albert networks. Furthermore, we investigate the stationary distribution of the number of infection states and the final antibody levels, and find that they both satisfy the normal distribution, but the standard deviation is small in the Barabasi Albert network. Finally, we explore the effect of individual antibody differences and decay rates on the final population antibody levels, and uncover that individual antibody differences do not affect the final mean antibody levels. The study offers valuable insights for epidemic prevention and control in practical applications.</description>

      <title>$N$-player game formulation of the majority-vote model of opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a self-centered perspective, it can be assumed that people only hold opinions that can benefit them. If opinions have no intrinsic value, and acquire their value when held by the majority of individuals in a discussion group, then we have a situation that can be modeled as an $N$-player game. Here we explore the dynamics of (binary) opinion formation using a game-theoretic framework to study an $N$-player game version of Galam's local majority-vote model. The opinion dynamics is modeled by a stochastic imitation dynamics in which the individuals copy the opinion of more successful peers. In the infinite population limit, this dynamics is described by the classical replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. The equilibrium solution shows a threshold separating the initial frequencies that lead to the fixation of one opinion or the other. A comparison with Galam's deterministic model reveals contrasting results, especially in the presence of inflexible individuals, who never change their opinions. In particular, the $N$-player game predicts a polarized equilibrium consisting only of extremists. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we evaluate the critical exponents that determine the population size dependence of the opinion's fixation probability and mean fixation times near the threshold. The results underscore the usefulness of combining evolutionary game theory with opinion dynamics and the importance of statistical physics tools to summarize the results of Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Perceived Social Influence on Vaccination Decisions: A COVID-19 Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the perceived influence of others, across both strong and weak social ties, on COVID-19 vaccination decisions in the United States. We add context to social influence by measuring related concepts, such as perceived agreement of others and perceived danger of COVID-19 to others. We find that vaccinated populations perceived more influence from their social circles than unvaccinated populations. This finding holds true across various social groups, including family, close friends, and neighbors. Vaccinated participants perceived that others agreed with their decision to get vaccinated more than unvaccinated participants perceived others to agree with their decision to not get vaccinated. Despite the clear differences in perceived social influence and agreement across the groups, the majority of participants across both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations perceived no social influence from all social group in their decisions. Aligning with this result, we find through open-ended responses that both vaccinated and unvaccinated participants frequently cited fear as a motivating factor in their decision, rather than social influence: vaccinated participants feared COVID-19, while unvaccinated participants feared the vaccine itself.</description>
