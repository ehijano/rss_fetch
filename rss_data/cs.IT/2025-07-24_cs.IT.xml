      <title>Fast One-Pass Sparse Approximation of the Top Eigenvectors of Huge Low-Rank Matrices? Yes, $MAM^*$!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications such as sparse PCA, in this paper we present provably-accurate one-pass algorithms for the sparse approximation of the top eigenvectors of extremely massive matrices based on a single compact linear sketch. The resulting compressive-sensing-based approaches can approximate the leading eigenvectors of huge approximately low-rank matrices that are too large to store in memory based on a single pass over its entries while utilizing a total memory footprint on the order of the much smaller desired sparse eigenvector approximations. Finally, the compressive sensing recovery algorithm itself (which takes the gathered compressive matrix measurements as input, and then outputs sparse approximations of its top eigenvectors) can also be formulated to run in a time which principally depends on the size of the sought sparse approximations, making its runtime sublinear in the size of the large matrix whose eigenvectors one aims to approximate. Preliminary experiments on huge matrices having $\sim 10^{16}$ entries illustrate the developed theory and demonstrate the practical potential of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Secure Wireless Communication via Polarforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarforming is a promising technique that enables dynamic adjustment of antenna polarization to mitigate depolarization effects commonly encountered during electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation. In this letter, we investigate the polarforming design for secure wireless communication systems, where the base station (BS) is equipped with polarization-reconfigurable antennas (PRAs) and can flexibly adjust the antenna polarization to transmit confidential information to a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper. To maximize the achievable secrecy rate, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to jointly optimize transmit beamforming and polarforming, where beamforming exploits spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to steer the transmit beam toward the user, while polarforming leverages polarization DoFs to align the polarization state of the EM wave received by the user with that of its antenna. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to conventional fixed-polarization antenna (FPA) systems, polarforming can fully exploit the DoFs in antenna polarization optimization to significantly enhance the security performance of wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Construction of Self-Orthogonal Quasi-Cyclic Codes and Their Application to Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, necessary and sufficient conditions for the self-orthogonality of t-generator quasi-cyclic (QC) codes are presented under the Euclidean, Hermitian, and symplectic inner products, respectively. Particularly, by studying the structure of the dual codes of a class of 2-generator QC codes, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the QC codes to be dual-containing under the above three inner products. This class of 2-generator QC codes generalizes many known codes in the literature. Based on the above conditions, we construct several quantum stabilizer codes and quantum synchronizable codes with good parameters, some of which share parameters with certain best-known codes listed in Grassl's code table.</description>

      <title>On Distributionally Robust Lossy Source Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributionally robust source coding, i.e., source coding under uncertainty in the source distribution, discussing both the coding and computational aspects of the problem. We propose two extensions of the so-called Strong Functional Representation Lemma (SFRL), considering the cases where, for a fixed conditional distribution, the marginal inducing the joint coupling belongs to either a finite set of distributions or a Kullback-Leibler divergence sphere (KL-Sphere) centered at a fixed nominal distribution. Using these extensions, we derive distributionally robust coding schemes for both the one-shot and asymptotic regimes, generalizing previous results in the literature. Focusing on the case where the source distribution belongs to a given KL-Sphere, we derive an implicit characterization of the points attaining the robust rate-distortion function (R-RDF), which we later exploit to implement a novel algorithm for computing the R-RDF. Finally, we characterize the analytical expression of the R-RDF for Bernoulli sources, providing a theoretical benchmark to evaluate the estimation performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Information Entropy-Based Scheduling for Communication-Efficient Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) over resource-constrained networks by introducing node-based and link-based scheduling strategies to enhance communication efficiency. In each iteration of the D-SGD algorithm, only a few disjoint subsets of nodes or links are randomly activated, subject to a given communication cost constraint. We propose a novel importance metric based on information entropy to determine node and link scheduling probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations, comparing it against state-of-the-art methods, including betweenness centrality (BC) for node scheduling and \textit{MATCHA} for link scheduling. The results show that our method consistently outperforms the BC-based method in the node scheduling case, achieving faster convergence with up to 60\% lower communication budgets. At higher communication budgets (above 60\%), our method maintains comparable or superior performance. In the link scheduling case, our method delivers results that are superior to or on par with those of \textit{MATCHA}.</description>

      <title>Learning to Write on Dirty Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirty paper coding (DPC) is a classical problem in information theory that considers communication in the presence of channel state known only at the transmitter. While the theoretical impact of DPC has been substantial, practical realizations of DPC, such as Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) or lattice-based schemes, often rely on specific modeling assumptions about the input, state and channel. In this work, we explore whether modern learning-based approaches can offer a complementary path forward by revisiting the DPC problem. We propose a data-driven solution in which both the encoder and decoder are parameterized by neural networks. Our proposed model operates without prior knowledge of the state (also referred to as "interference"), channel or input statistics, and recovers nonlinear mappings that yield effective interference pre-cancellation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first interpretable proof-of-concept demonstrating that learning-based DPC schemes can recover characteristic features of well-established solutions, such as THP and lattice-based precoding, and outperform them in several regimes.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Achievable Rate-Distortion Region for Indirect Wyner-Ziv Source Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17432v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Wyner-Ziv source coding problem, a source $X$ has to be encoded while the decoder has access to side information $Y$. This paper investigates the indirect setup, in which a latent source $S$, unobserved by both the encoder and the decoder, must also be reconstructed at the decoder. This scenario is increasingly relevant in the context of goal-oriented communications, where $S$ can represent semantic information obtained from $X$. This paper derives the indirect Wyner-Ziv rate-distortion function in asymptotic regime and provides an achievable region in finite block-length. Furthermore, a Blahut-Arimoto algorithm tailored for the indirect Wyner-Ziv setup, is proposed. This algorithm is then used to give a numerical evaluation of the achievable indirect rate-distortion region when $S$ is treated as a classification label.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Equivalence of Skew Polycyclic Codes over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study skew polycyclic codes over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, associated with a skew polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{F}_q[x;\sigma]$, where $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{F}_q$. We start by proving the Roos-like bound for both the Hamming and the rank metric for this class of codes. Next, we focus on the Hamming and rank equivalence between two classes of polycyclic codes by introducing an equivalence relation and describing its equivalence classes. Finally, we present examples that illustrate applications of the theory developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>On Function-Correcting Codes in the Lee Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes are a coding framework designed to minimize redundancy while ensuring that specific functions or computations of encoded data can be reliably recovered, even in the presence of errors. The choice of metric is crucial in designing such codes, as it determines which computations must be protected and how errors are measured and corrected. Previous work by Liu and Liu [6] studied function-correcting codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^l},\ l\geq 2$ using the homogeneous metric, which coincides with the Lee metric over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. In this paper, we extend the study to codes over $\mathbb{Z}_m,$ for any positive integer $m\geq 2$ under the Lee metric and aim to determine their optimal redundancy. To achieve this, we introduce irregular Lee distance codes and derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal redundancy by characterizing the shortest possible length of such codes. These general bounds are then simplified and applied to specific classes of functions, including Lee-local functions, Lee weight functions, and Lee weight distribution functions, leading to improved some bounds compared to those of Liu and Liu [6] over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and generalize the other bounds over $\mathbb{Z}_m$ in the Lee metric.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Private Information Retrieval (SPIR) on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) on replicated databases modeled by a simple graph. In this model, each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only if there is an edge between them. We consider the setting where the server-side common randomness necessary to accomplish SPIR is also replicated at the servers according to the graph, and we call this as message-specific common randomness. In this setting, we establish a lower bound on the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum download rate, for general graphs, by proposing an achievable SPIR scheme. Next, we prove that, for any SPIR scheme to be feasible, the minimum size of message-specific randomness should be equal to the size of a message. Finally, by providing matching upper bounds, we derive the exact SPIR capacity for the class of path and regular graphs.</description>

      <title>How Many Simultaneous Beamformers are Needed for Integrated Sensing and Communications?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14982v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a downlink integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system in which a base station employs linear beamforming to communicate to $K$ users, while simultaneously uses sensing beams to perform a sensing task of estimating $L$ real parameters. How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best performance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds on the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is measured in terms of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and communications performance is measured in terms of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires at most $K + \sqrt{\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the ability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling interference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes $\sqrt{K^2 + \frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound on the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task individually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the performance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the beamformers. In this case, the bound becomes $K + \sqrt{d}$ and $\sqrt{K^2 + d}$, respectively. Specifically, for estimating complex path losses and angles-of-arrival of $N_\text{tr}$ targets while communicating to $K$ users, the bound on the minimum number of beamformers scales linearly in $K$ and in $N_\text{tr}$, assuming interference from sensing can be cancelled. When interference cancellation is not possible, the following exact characterization for the case of $N_\text{tr} = 1$ can be obtained: when $K=0$ or $1$, two beamformers should be used; when $K \ge 2$, exactly $K$ beamformers should be used, i.e., communication beamformers alone are already sufficient.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits of distributed covariance matrix estimation via a conditional strong data processing inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices is a key task across many fields. This paper explores the theoretical limits of distributed covariance estimation in a feature-split setting, where communication between agents is constrained. Specifically, we study a scenario in which multiple agents each observe different components of i.i.d. samples drawn from a sub-Gaussian random vector. A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using a limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight minimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and Frobenius norm. Our main technical tool is a novel generalization of the strong data processing inequality (SDPI), termed the Conditional Strong Data Processing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, introduced in this work. The C-SDPI coefficient shares key properties such as tensorization with the conventional SDPI. Crucially, it quantifies the average contraction in a state-dependent channel and can be significantly lower than the worst-case SDPI coefficient over the state input.
  Utilizing the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and an operator Jensen inequality, we compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels. We then employ it to establish minimax lower bounds on estimation error, capturing the trade-offs among sample size, communication cost, and data dimensionality. Building on this, we present a nearly optimal estimation protocol whose sample and communication requirements match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Unlike much of the existing literature, our framework does not assume infinite samples or Gaussian distributions, making it broadly applicable. Finally, we extend our analysis to interactive protocols, showing interaction can significantly reduce communication requirements compared to non-interactive schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Secret Sharing with Classical and Quantum Shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum secret sharing, a quantum secret state is mapped to multiple shares such that shares from qualified sets can recover the secret state and shares from other forbidden sets reveal nothing about the secret state; we study the setting where there are both classical shares and quantum shares. We show that the quantum secret sharing problem with both classical and quantum shares is feasible if and only if any two qualified sets have some quantum share in common. Next, for threshold quantum secret sharing where there are $N_1$ classical shares, $N_2$ quantum shares and qualified sets consist of any $K_1$ (or more) classical shares and any $K_2 &gt; N_2/2$ (or more) quantum shares, we show that to share $1$ qubit secret, each classical share needs to be at least $2$ bits and each quantum share needs to be at least $1$ qubit. Finally, we characterize the minimum share sizes for quantum secret sharing with at most $2$ classical shares and at most $2$ quantum shares. The converse proofs rely on quantum information inequalities and the achievable schemes use classical secret sharing, (encrypted) quantum secret sharing with only quantum shares, superdense coding, treating quantum digits as classical digits, and their various combinations.</description>

      <title>Slow Fluid Antenna Multiple Access with Multiport Receivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether equipping fluid-antenna (FA) receivers with multiple ($L&gt;1$) radiofrequency (RF) chains can improve the performance of the slow fluid-antenna multiple access (FAMA) technique, which enables open-loop connectivity with channel state information (CSI) available only at the receiver side. We analyze the case of slow-FAMA users equipped with multiport receivers, so that $L$ ports of the FA are selected and combined to reduce interference. We show that a joint design of the port selection matrix and the combining vector at each receiver yields significant performance gains over reference schemes, demonstrating the potential of multiport reception in FA systems with a limited number of RF chains.</description>

Abstract: Dual discriminator generative adversarial networks (D2 GANs) were introduced to mitigate the problem of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks. In D2 GANs, two discriminators are employed alongside a generator: one discriminator rewards high scores for samples from the true data distribution, while the other favors samples from the generator. In this work, we first introduce dual discriminator $\alpha$-GANs (D2 $\alpha$-GANs), which combines the strengths of dual discriminators with the flexibility of a tunable loss function, $\alpha$-loss. We further generalize this approach to arbitrary functions defined on positive reals, leading to a broader class of models we refer to as generalized dual discriminator generative adversarial networks. For each of these proposed models, we provide theoretical analysis and show that the associated min-max optimization reduces to the minimization of a linear combination of an $f$-divergence and a reverse $f$-divergence. This generalizes the known simplification for D2-GANs, where the objective reduces to a linear combination of the KL-divergence and the reverse KL-divergence. Finally, we perform experiments on 2D synthetic data and use multiple performance metrics to capture various advantages of our GANs.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Identification of Lattice Quantizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattices with minimal normalized second moments are designed using a new numerical optimization algorithm. Starting from a random lower-triangular generator matrix and applying stochastic gradient descent, all elements are updated towards the negative gradient, which makes it the most efficient algorithm proposed so far for this purpose. A graphical illustration of the theta series, called theta image, is introduced and shown to be a powerful tool for converting numerical lattice representations into their underlying exact forms. As a proof of concept, optimized lattices are designed in dimensions up to 16. In all dimensions, the algorithm converges to either the previously best known lattice or a better one. The dual of the 15-dimensional laminated lattice is conjectured to be optimal in its dimension and its exact normalized second moment is computed.</description>

      <title>Universal Decoding over Finite-State Additive Channels via Noise Guessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study universal decoding over unknown discrete additive channels determined by a finite-state (unifilar) random process. Aiming at low-complexity decoders, we study variants of noise-guessing decoders that use estimators for the probability of a noise sequence when the actual channel law is unknown. A deterministic version produces noise sequences in a fixed order, and a new randomised version draws them at random, until finding a sequence that, subtracted from the received sequence, results in a valid codeword. We show that both strategies are random-coding universal (i.e. have the same random-coding error exponent as the optimal maximum likelihood decoding), and derive upper bounds for their complexity. Numerical examples in additive Markov channels illustrate the proposed methods' performance, showing that they consistently outperform a more usual training-based strategy.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Families of Polycyclic Codes over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equivalence of families of polycyclic codes associated with polynomials of the form $x^n - a_{n-1}x^{n-1} - \ldots - a_1x - a_0$ over a finite field. We begin with the specific case of polycyclic codes associated with a trinomial $x^n - a_{\ell} x^{\ell} - a_0$ (for some $0&lt; \ell &lt;n$), which we refer to as \textit{$\ell$-trinomial codes}, after which we generalize our results to general polycyclic codes. We introduce an equivalence relation called \textit{$n$-equivalence}, which extends the known notion of $n$-equivalence for constacyclic codes \cite{Chen2014}. We compute the number of $n$-equivalence classes %, $ N_{(n,\ell)}$, for this relation and provide conditions under which two families of polycyclic (or $\ell$-trinomial) codes are equivalent. In particular, we prove that when $\gcd(n, n-\ell) = 1$, any $\ell$-trinomial code family is equivalent to a trinomial code family associated with the polynomial $x^n - x^{\ell} - 1$. Finally, we focus on $p^{\ell}$-trinomial codes of length $p^{\ell+r}$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $r$ an integer, and provide some examples as an application of the theory developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing for Enhanced Straggler Resilience and Numerical Stability in Distributed CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices necessitates efficient management of computational resources, often via distributed environments susceptible to latency from straggler nodes. This paper introduces the Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing (FCDCC) framework to enhance straggler resilience and numerical stability in distributed CNNs. We extend Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) with Circulant and Rotation Matrix Embedding (CRME) which was originally proposed for matrix multiplication to high-dimensional tensor convolution. For the proposed scheme, referred to as the Numerically Stable Coded Tensor Convolution (NSCTC) scheme, we also propose two new coded partitioning schemes: Adaptive-Padding Coded Partitioning (APCP) for the input tensor and Kernel-Channel Coded Partitioning (KCCP) for the filter tensor. These strategies enable linear decomposition of tensor convolutions and encoding them into CDC subtasks, combining model parallelism with coded redundancy for robust and efficient execution. Theoretical analysis identifies an optimal trade-off between communication and storage costs. Empirical results validate the framework's effectiveness in computational efficiency, straggler resilience, and scalability across various CNN architectures.</description>

      <title>AI and Deep Learning for Terahertz Ultra-Massive MIMO: From Model-Driven Approaches to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explored the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing the challenges posed by terahertz ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems. It begins by outlining the characteristics of terahertz UM-MIMO systems and identifies three primary challenges for transceiver design: computational complexity, modeling difficulty, and measurement limitations. The study posits that AI provides a promising solution to these challenges. Three systematic research roadmaps are proposed for developing AI algorithms tailored to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. The first roadmap, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes the importance of leveraging available domain knowledge and advocates the adoption of AI only to enhance bottleneck modules within an established signal processing or optimization framework. Four essential steps are discussed: algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss-function design, and neural architecture design. The second roadmap presents channel state information (CSI) foundation models, aimed at unifying the design of different transceiver modules by focusing on their shared foundation, that is, the wireless channel. The training of a single compact foundation model is proposed to estimate the score function of wireless channels, which serve as a versatile prior for designing a wide variety of transceiver modules. Four essential steps are outlined: general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, joint design of CSI foundation models, and model-driven DL. The third roadmap aims to explore potential directions for applying pretrained large language models (LLMs) to terahertz UM-MIMO systems. Several application scenarios are envisioned, including LLM-based estimation, optimization, search, network management, and protocol understanding. Finally, the study highlights open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Exact Matching in Correlated Networks with Node Attributes for Improved Community Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study community detection in multiple networks with jointly correlated node attributes and edges. This setting arises naturally in applications such as social platforms, where a shared set of users may exhibit both correlated friendship patterns and correlated attributes across different platforms. Extending the classical Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and its contextual counterpart (Contextual SBM or CSBM), we introduce the correlated CSBM, which incorporates structural and attribute correlations across graphs. To build intuition, we first analyze correlated Gaussian Mixture Models, wherein only correlated node attributes are available without edges, and identify the conditions under which an estimator minimizing the distance between attributes achieves exact matching of nodes across the two databases. For the correlated CSBMs, we develop a two-step procedure that first applies $k$-core matching to most nodes using edge information, then refines the matching for the remaining unmatched nodes by leveraging their attributes with a distance-based estimator. We identify the conditions under which the algorithm recovers the exact node correspondence, enabling us to merge the correlated edges and average the correlated attributes for enhanced community detection. Crucially, by aligning and combining graphs, we identify regimes in which community detection is impossible in a single graph but becomes feasible when side information from correlated graphs is incorporated. Our results illustrate how the interplay between graph matching and community recovery can boost performance, broadening the scope of multi-graph, attribute-based community detection.</description>
