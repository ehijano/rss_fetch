      <title>Variational Green's Functions for Volumetric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green's functions characterize the fundamental solutions of partial differential equations; they are essential for tasks ranging from shape analysis to physical simulation, yet they remain computationally prohibitive to evaluate on arbitrary geometric discretizations. We present Variational Green's Function (VGF), a method that learns a smooth, differentiable representation of the Green's function for linear self-adjoint PDE operators, including the Poisson, the screened Poisson, and the biharmonic equations. To resolve the sharp singularities characteristic of the Green's functions, our method decomposes the Green's function into an analytic free-space component, and a learned corrector component. Our method leverages a variational foundation to impose Neumann boundary conditions naturally, and imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions via a projective layer on the output of the neural field. The resulting Green's functions are fast to evaluate, differentiable with respect to source application, and can be conditioned on other signals parameterizing our geometry.</description>

      <title>Real-time Rendering with a Neural Irradiance Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rendering diffuse global illumination in real-time is often approximated by pre-computing and storing irradiance in a 3D grid of probes. As long as most of the scene remains static, probes approximate irradiance for all surfaces immersed in the irradiance volume, including novel dynamic objects. This approach, however, suffers from aliasing artifacts and high memory consumption. We propose Neural Irradiance Volume (NIV), a neural-based technique that allows accurate real-time rendering of diffuse global illumination via a compact pre-computed model, overcoming the limitations of traditional probe-based methods, such as the expensive memory footprint, aliasing artifacts, and scene-specific heuristics. The key insight is that neural compression creates an adaptive and amortized representation of irradiance, circumventing the cubic scaling of grid-based methods. Our superior memory-scaling improves quality by at least 10x at the same memory budget, and enables a straightforward representation of higher-dimensional irradiance fields, allowing rendering of time-varying or dynamic effects without requiring additional computation at runtime. Unlike other neural rendering techniques, our method works within strict real-time constraints, providing fast inference (around 1 ms per frame on consumer GPUs at full HD resolution), reduced memory usage (1-5 MB for medium-sized scenes), and only requires a G-buffer as input, without expensive ray tracing or denoising.</description>

      <title>SPRig: Self-Supervised Pose-Invariant Rigging from Mesh Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art rigging methods assume a canonical rest pose--an assumption that fails for sequential data (e.g., animal motion capture or AIGC/video-derived mesh sequences) that lack the T-pose. Applied frame-by-frame, these methods are not pose-invariant and produce topological inconsistencies across frames. Thus We propose SPRig, a general fine-tuning framework that enforces cross-frame consistency losses to learn pose-invariant rigs on top of existing models. We validate our approach on rigging using a new permutation-invariant stability protocol. Experiments demonstrate SOTA temporal stability: our method produces coherent rigs from challenging sequences and dramatically reduces the artifacts that plague baseline methods. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>GSM-GS: Geometry-Constrained Single and Multi-view Gaussian Splatting for Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent research direction owing to its ultrarapid training speed and high-fidelity rendering capabilities. However, the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds poses challenges to reconstruction accuracy. This limitation frequently causes high-frequency detail loss in complex surface microstructures when relying solely on routine strategies. To address this limitation, we propose GSM-GS: a synergistic optimization framework integrating single-view adaptive sub-region weighting constraints and multi-view spatial structure refinement. For single-view optimization, we leverage image gradient features to partition scenes into texture-rich and texture-less sub-regions. The reconstruction quality is enhanced through adaptive filtering mechanisms guided by depth discrepancy features. This preserves high-weight regions while implementing a dual-branch constraint strategy tailored to regional texture variations, thereby improving geometric detail characterization. For multi-view optimization, we introduce a geometry-guided cross-view point cloud association method combined with a dynamic weight sampling strategy. This constructs 3D structural normal constraints across adjacent point cloud frames, effectively reinforcing multi-view consistency and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves both competitive rendering quality and geometric reconstruction. See our interactive project page</description>

      <title>FlexAM: Flexible Appearance-Motion Decomposition for Versatile Video Generation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective and generalizable control in video generation remains a significant challenge. While many methods rely on ambiguous or task-specific signals, we argue that a fundamental disentanglement of "appearance" and "motion" provides a more robust and scalable pathway. We propose FlexAM, a unified framework built upon a novel 3D control signal. This signal represents video dynamics as a point cloud, introducing three key enhancements: multi-frequency positional encoding to distinguish fine-grained motion, depth-aware positional encoding, and a flexible control signal for balancing precision and generative quality. This representation allows FlexAM to effectively disentangle appearance and motion, enabling a wide range of tasks including I2V/V2V editing, camera control, and spatial object editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexAM achieves superior performance across all evaluated tasks.</description>

      <title>Variation-aware Flexible 3D Gaussian Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indirect editing methods for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently witnessed significant advancements. These approaches operate by first applying edits in the rendered 2D space and subsequently projecting the modifications back into 3D. However, this paradigm inevitably introduces cross-view inconsistencies and constrains both the flexibility and efficiency of the editing process. To address these challenges, we present VF-Editor, which enables native editing of Gaussian primitives by predicting attribute variations in a feedforward manner. To accurately and efficiently estimate these variations, we design a novel variation predictor distilled from 2D editing knowledge. The predictor encodes the input to generate a variation field and employs two learnable, parallel decoding functions to iteratively infer attribute changes for each 3D Gaussian. Thanks to its unified design, VF-Editor can seamlessly distill editing knowledge from diverse 2D editors and strategies into a single predictor, allowing for flexible and effective knowledge transfer into the 3D domain. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets reveal the inherent limitations of indirect editing pipelines and validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.</description>
