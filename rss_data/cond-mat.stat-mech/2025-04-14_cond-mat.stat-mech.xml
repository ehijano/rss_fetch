      <title>The temperature dependent thermal vector potential in spinor Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal scalar and vector potential were introduced to investigate the thermal transport under a temperature gradient in terms of linear response theory[1,2]. However, the microscopic origin of these phenomenological thermal potentials had not been addressed clearly. In this manuscript, we try to derive a temperature dependent damping force based on the spinor Boltzmann equation (SBE), and relate it with the thermal gauge potential, which is exactly the temperature dependent thermal scalar and vector potential. It is shown that the thermal potential originates from the scattering of conduction electrons and impurity or other scattering mechanisms. We also derive a temperature dependent inverse relaxation time, which depends on momentum, it is different from the usual constant relaxation time. We evaluate the temperature dependent damping force by an approximated analytical solution of SBE. The other physical observable such as charge current and spin current are also explored.</description>

      <title>Entropically Driven Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populations of agents often exhibit surprising collective behavior emerging from simple local interactions. The common belief is that the agents must posses a certain level of cognitive abilities for such an emerging collective behavior to occur. However, contrary to this assumption, it is also well known that even noncognitive agents are capable of displaying nontrivial behavior. Here we consider an intermediate case, where the agents borrow a little bit from both extremes. We assume a population of agents performing random-walk in a bounded environment, on a square lattice. The agents can sense their immediate neighborhood, and they will attempt to move into a randomly selected empty site, by avoiding collisions.Also, the agents will temporary stop moving when they are in contact with at least two other agents. We show that surprisingly, such a rudimentary population of agents undergoes a percolation phase transition and self-organizes in a large polymer like structure, as a consequence of an attractive entropic force emerging from their restricted-valence and local spatial arrangement.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum inference problems and quantum hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability' transitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's ability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a phase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability transition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not clear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general quantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov structure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We show a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they coincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving Haar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes non-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones. This allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes optimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and 'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions coincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction on the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising model (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric monitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we call the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase diagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary numerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class. For the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which displays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with their interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on their shapes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Contact Model with Diffusion Beyond the Conventional Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contact process is a non-equilibrium Hamiltonian model that, even in one dimension, lacks an exact solution and has been extensively studied via Monte Carlo simulations, both in steady-state and time-dependent scenarios. Although the effects of particle mobility/diffusion on criticality have been preliminarily investigated, they remain incompletely understood. In this work, we examine how the critical rate of the model varies with the probability of particle mobility. By analyzing different stochastic evolutions of the system, we employ two modern approaches: 1) Random Matrix Theory (RMT): By building on the success of RMT, particularly Wishart-like matrices, in studying statistical physics of systems with up-down symmetry via magnetization dynamics [R. da Silva, IJMPC 2022], we demonstrate its applicability to models with an absorbing state. 2) Optimized Temporal Power Laws: By using short-time dynamics, we optimize power laws derived from ensemble-averaged evolutions of the system. Both methods consistently reveal that the critical rate decays with mobility according to a simple Belehradek function. Additionally, a straightforward mean-field analysis supports the decay of the critical parameter with mobility, although it predicts a simpler linear dependence.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic fluctuation theory of correlations in hard rod gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a theoretical framework known as ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory has been developed to study large-scale fluctuations and correlations in many-body systems exhibiting ballistic transport. In this paper, we review this theory in the context of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods. The initial configurations of the rods are sampled from a probability distribution characterized by slowly varying conserved density profiles across space. Beginning from a microscopic description, we first formulate the macroscopic fluctuation theory in terms of the phase-space density of quasiparticles. In the second part, we apply this framework to compute the two-point, two-time correlation functions of the conserved densities in the Euler scaling limit. We derive an explicit expression for the correlation function, which not only reveals its inherent symmetries but is also straightforward to evaluate numerically for a given initial state. Our results also recover known expressions for space-time correlations in equilibrium for the hard rod gas.</description>

      <title>Micro Heat Engines With Hydrodynamic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic flows are often generated in colloidal suspensions. Since colloidal particles are frequently used to construct stochastic heat engines, we study how the hydrodynamic flows influence the output parameters of the engine. We study a single colloidal particle confined in a harmonic trap with time-periodic stiffness that provides the engine protocol, in presence of a steady linear shear flow. The nature of the flow (circular, elliptic or hyperbolic) is externally tunable. At long times, the work done by the flow field is shown to dominate over the thermodynamic (Jarzynski) work done by the trap, if there is an appreciable deviation from the circular flow. The work by the time dependent trap is the sole contributor only for a perfectly circular flow. We also study an extended model, where a microscopic spinning particle (spinor) is tethered close to the colloidal particle, i.e. the working substance of the engine, such that the flow generated by the spinor influences the dynamics of the colloidal particle. We simulate the system and explore the influence of such a flow on the thermodynamics of the engine. We further find that for larger spinning frequencies, the work done by the flow dominates and the system cannot produce thermodynamic work.</description>

      <title>Impact of network assortativity on disease lifetime in the SIS model of epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately represent disease spread, epidemiological models must account for the complex network topology and contact heterogeneity. Traditionally, most studies have used random heterogeneous networks, which ignore correlations between the nodes' degrees. Yet, many real-world networks exhibit degree assortativity - the tendency for nodes with similar degrees to connect. Here we explore the effect degree assortativity (or disassortativity) has on long-term dynamics and disease extinction in the realm of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model on heterogeneous networks. We derive analytical results for the mean time to extinction (MTE) in assortative networks with weak heterogeneity, and show that increased assortativity reduces the MTE and that assortativity and degree heterogeneity are interchangeable with regard to their impact on the MTE. Our analytical results are verified using the weighted ensemble numerical method, on both synthetic and real-world networks. Notably, this method allows us to go beyond the capabilities of traditional numerical tools, enabling us to study rare events in large assortative networks, which were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the liquid-vapor interface. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on a quasi-continuum approach. Experimental evidence for this effect has been scarce so far. Here, we examine evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates, including the liquid films on both sides, by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Our solution shows that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, i.e., the evaporative refrigeration effect. Our work not only re-affirms the refrigeration effect, but clarifies that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. At the interface, the asymmetry in the distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules creates a cooling effect, which is the dominant mechanism. Additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. Our work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning and refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Learning rate matrix and information-thermodynamic trade-off relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium systems exchange information in addition to energy. In information thermodynamics, the information flow is characterized by the learning rate, which is not invariant under coordinate transformations. To formalize the property of the learning rate under variable transformations, we introduce a learning rate matrix. This matrix has the learning rates as its diagonal elements and characterizes the changes in the learning rates under linear coordinate transformations. The maximal eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the learning rate matrix gives the maximal information flow under orthogonal transformations. Furthermore, we derive a new trade-off relation between the learning rate and the heat dissipation of a subsystem. Finally, we illustrate the results using analytically solvable yet experimentally feasible models.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Flow of Information in a Nonequilibrium Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the origin of nonequilibrium characteristics in a generic interacting system having multiple degrees of freedom is a challenging task. In this context, information theoretic measures such as mutual information and related polymorphs offer valuable insights. Here, we explore these measures in a minimal experimental model consisting of two hydrodynamically coupled colloidal particles, where a nonequilibrium drive is introduced via an exponentially correlated noise acting on one of the particles. We show that the information-theoretic tools considered enable a systematic, data-driven dissection of information flow within the system. These measures allow us to identify the driving node and reconstruct the directional dependencies between particles. Notably, they help explain a recently observed, counterintuitive trend in the dependence of irreversibility on interaction strength under coarse-graining (B. Das et.al., arXiv:2405.00800 (2024)). Finally, our results demonstrate how directional information measures can uncover the hidden structure of nonequilibrium dynamics and provide a framework for studying similar effects in more complex systems.</description>

      <title>Universality, Robustness, and Limits of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) underpins much of our modern understanding of the thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of the Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the validity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of several physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we consider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one postselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps. The average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and we show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other hand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces to a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy modeling of Optimal Transport: the sub-optimality regime and the transition from dense to sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bipartite network model that captures intermediate stages of optimization by blending the Maximum Entropy approach with Optimal Transport. In this framework, the network's constraints define the total mass each node can supply or receive, while an external cost field favors a minimal set of links, driving the system toward a sparse, tree-like structure. By tuning the control parameter, one transitions from uniformly distributed weights to an optimal transport regime in which weights condense onto cost-favorable edges. We quantify this dense-to-sparse transition, showing with numerical analyses that the process does not hinge on specific assumptions about the node-strength or cost distributions. Finite-size analysis confirms that the results persist in the thermodynamic limit. Because the model offers explicit control over the degree of sub-optimality, this approach lends to practical applications in link prediction, network reconstruction, and statistical validation, particularly in systems where partial optimization coexists with other noise-like factors.</description>

      <title>The Exploratory Study on the Relationship Between the Failure of Distance Metrics in High-Dimensional Space and Emergent Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, integrating information theory and statistical mechanics, to connect metric failure in high-dimensional data with emergence in complex systems. We propose the "Information Dilution Theorem," demonstrating that as dimensionality ($d$) increases, the mutual information efficiency between geometric metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) and system states decays approximately as $O(1/d)$. This decay arises from the mismatch between linearly growing system entropy and sublinearly growing metric entropy, explaining the mechanism behind distance concentration. Building on this, we introduce information structural complexity ($C(S)$) based on the mutual information matrix spectrum and interaction encoding capacity ($C'$) derived from information bottleneck theory. The "Emergence Critical Theorem" states that when $C(S)$ exceeds $C'$, new global features inevitably emerge, satisfying a predefined mutual information threshold. This provides an operational criterion for self-organization and phase transitions. We discuss potential applications in physics, biology, and deep learning, suggesting potential directions like MI-based manifold learning (UMAP+) and offering a quantitative foundation for analyzing emergence across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Variational principle for the time evolution operator, its usefulness in effective theories of condensed matter systems and a glimpse into the role played by the quantum geometry of unitary transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work discusses a variational approach to determining the time evolution operator. We directly see a glimpse of how a generalization of the quantum geometric tensor for unitary operators plays a central role in parameter evolution. We try the method with the simplest ansatz (a power series in a time-independent Hamiltonian), which yields considerable improvements over a Taylor series. These improvements are because, unlike for a Taylor series of $\exp(-iHt)$, time $t$ is not forced to appear in the same order as $H$, giving more flexibility for the description. We demonstrate that our results can also be employed to improve degenerate perturbation theory in a non-perturbative fashion. We concede that our approach described here is most useful for finite-dimensional Hamiltonians. As a first example of applications to perturbation theory, we present AB bilayer graphene, which we downfolded to a 2x2 model; our energy results considerably improve typical second-order degenerate perturbation theory. We then demonstrate that the approach can also be used to derive a non-perturbatively valid Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Here, the approach for a finite-size lattice yields excellent results. However, the corrections are not ideal for the thermodynamic limit (they depend on the number of sites $N$). Nevertheless, the approach adds almost no additional technical complications over typical perturbative expansions of unitary operators, making it ready for deployment in physics questions. One should expect considerably improved couplings for the degenerate perturbation theory of finite-size systems. More work is needed in the many-body case, and we suggest a possible remedy to issues with the thermodynamic limit. Our work hints at how the appearance of mathematically beautiful concepts like quantum geometry can indicate an opportunity to dig for approximations beyond typical perturbation theory</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetries in the fluctuation-driven regime: an application of Noether's theorem to noisy dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noether's theorem provides a powerful link between continuous symmetries and conserved quantities for systems governed by some variational principle. Perhaps unfortunately, most dynamical systems of interest in neuroscience and artificial intelligence cannot be described by any such principle. On the other hand, nonequilibrium physics provides a variational principle that describes how fairly generic noisy dynamical systems are most likely to transition between two states; in this work, we exploit this principle to apply Noether's theorem, and hence learn about how the continuous symmetries of dynamical systems constrain their most likely trajectories. We identify analogues of the conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum, and briefly discuss examples of each in the context of models of decision-making, recurrent neural networks, and diffusion generative models.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Colloidal Dynamics under Stochastic Resetting: Competing Effects of Particle Interactions on the Steady State Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random arrest of the diffusion of a single particle and its return to its origin has served as the paradigmatic example of a large variety of processes undergoing stochastic resetting. While the implications and applications of stochastic resetting for a single particle are well understood, less is known about resetting of many interacting particles. In this study, we experimentally and numerically investigate a system of six colloidal particles undergoing two types of stochastic resetting protocols: global resetting, where all particles are returned to their origin simultaneously, and local resetting, where particles are reset one at a time. Our particles interact mainly through hard-core repulsion and hydrodynamic flows. We find that the most substantial effect of interparticle interactions is observed for local resetting, specifically when particles are physically dragged to the origin. In this case, hard-core repulsion broadens the steady-state distribution, while hydrodynamic interactions significantly narrow the distribution. The combination results in a steady-state distribution that is wider compared to that of a single particle system both for global and local resetting protocols.</description>

      <title>Influence of packing protocol on fractal exponents in dense polydisperse packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fractal properties of a system of densely and randomly packed disks, obeying a power-law distribution of radii, which is generated by using various protocols: Delaunay triangulation (DT) with both zero and periodic boundary conditions and the constant pressure protocol with periodic boundary conditions. The power-law exponents of the mass-radius relation and structure factor are obtained numerically for various values of the size ratio of the distribution, defined as the largest-to-smallest radius ratio. It is shown that the size ratio is an important control parameter responsible for the consistency of the fractal properties of the system: the greater the ratio, the less the finite size effects are pronounced and the better the agreement between the exponents. For the DT protocol, the exponents of the mass-radius relation, structure factor, and power-law distribution coincide even at moderate values of the size ratio. By contrast, for the constant-pressure protocol, all three exponents are found to be different for both moderate (around 300) and large (around 1500) size ratios, which might indicate a biased rather than random spatial distribution of the disks. Nevertheless, there is a tendency for the exponents to converge as the size ratio increases, suggesting that all the exponents become equal in the limit of infinite size ratio.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Induced Threshold on Integrability Footprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of a dissipative environment disrupts the unitary spectrum of dynamical quantum maps. Nevertheless, key features of the underlying unitary dynamics -- such as their integrable or chaotic nature -- are not immediately erased by dissipation. To investigate this, we model dissipation as a convex combination of a unitary evolution and a random Kraus map, and study how signatures of integrability fade as dissipation strength increases. Our analysis shows that in the weakly dissipative regime, the complex eigenvalue spectrum organizes into well-defined, high-density clusters. We estimate the critical dissipation threshold beyond which these clusters disappear, rendering the dynamics indistinguishable from chaotic evolution. This threshold depends only on the number of spectral clusters and the rank of the random Kraus operator. To characterize this transition, we introduce the eigenvalue angular velocity as a diagnostic of integrability loss. We illustrate our findings through several integrable quantum circuits, including the dissipative quantum Fourier transform. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how noise gradually erases the footprints of integrability in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Existence of Nonequilibrium Glasses in the Degenerate Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground-State Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stealthy interactions are an emerging class of nontrivial, bounded long-ranged oscillatory pair potentials with classical ground states that can be disordered, hyperuniform, and infinitely degenerate. Their hybrid crystal-liquid nature endows them with novel physical properties with advantages over their crystalline counterparts. Here, we show the existence of nonequilibrium hard-sphere glasses within this unusual ground-state manifold as the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ tends to zero that are remarkably configurationally extremely close to hyperuniform 3D maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere packings. The latter are prototypical glasses since they are maximally disordered, perfectly rigid, and perfectly nonergodic. Our optimization procedure, which leverages the maximum cardinality of the infinite ground-state set, not only guarantees that our packings are hyperuniform with the same structure-factor scaling exponent as the MRJ state, but they share other salient structural attributes, including a packing fraction of $0.638$, a mean contact number per particle of 6, gap exponent of $0.44(1)$, and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ and structures factors $S(k)$ that are virtually identical to one another for all $r$ and $k$, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform packings can be created within the disordered regime ($0 &lt; \chi &lt;1/2$) with heretofore unattained maximal packing fractions. As $\chi$ increases from zero, they always form interparticle contacts, albeit with sparser contact networks as $\chi$ increases from zero, resulting in linear polymer-like chains of contacting particles with increasingly shorter chain lengths. The capacity to generate ultradense stealthy hyperuniform packings for all $\chi$ opens up new materials applications in optics and acoustics.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry from the Moyal product: quantum kinetic equation and non-linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive the dissipationless quantum kinetic equation for a multi-band free fermionic system with U(1) symmetry. Using the Moyal product formalism, we fully band-diagonalize the dynamics. Expanding to the second order in gradients, which is beyond the semiclassical limit, we give a complete analysis of the band-resolved thermodynamics and transport properties, especially those arising from the quantum geometric tensor. We apply our framework to a Bloch band theory under electric fields near equilibrium and find the linear and nonlinear transport coefficients. We also obtain the dynamical density-density response functions in the metallic case, including quantum metric corrections. Our results and approach can be applied very generally to multi-band problems even in situations with spatially varying Hamiltonians and distributions.</description>

Abstract: A unified thermodynamic formalism describing the efficiency of learning is proposed. First, we derive an inequality, which is more strength than Clausius's inequality, revealing the lower bound of the entropy-production rate of a subsystem. Second, the inequality is transformed to determine the general upper limit for the efficiency of learning. In particular, we exemplify the bound of the efficiency in nonequilibrium quantum-dot systems and networks of living cells. The framework provides a fundamental trade-off relationship between energy and information inheriting in stochastic thermodynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Operator dynamics in Floquet many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an alternative scenario for the propagation of thermal noise in a conductor. In this scenario, the noise in the emf (electromotive force) between two terminals cannot be described as a sum of contributions from uncorrelated regions, each in local thermal equilibrium. We review previous studies of thermal noise in circuits with nonuniform temperature. We suggest experiments that could distinguish between different scenarios. We build a workable 1D model for a gas of particles that undergo stochastic collisions with the lattice and exert distance-dependent forces on each other. We enunciate definitions of current, voltage, and emf, appropriate to a wire with limited number of particles. For uniform temperature, within appropriate length and temperature ranges, our simulations comply with Nyquist's result. Analytic results can be obtained in the limit of strong interparticle interaction. The simulations indicate that (1) thermal noise in a resistor at uniform temperature within an electric circuit can be larger (smaller) than predicted by Nyquist due to the presence of a resistor with higher (lower) temperature in the circuit; (2) for sufficiently long circuits, the deviation from the Nyquist prediction is inversely proportional to the distance between the centers of the resistors; (3) if the resistors differ in temperature, their emf can be correlated, even if they are detached. The long-range repulsion between charges in electrically connected resistors may have conceptual and technological impact in nanodevices.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider the classical problem of a freely joined chain of Brownian particles connected by elastic springs and study its conformational probability distribution function in the overdamped regime in the limit of infinite stiffness of constraints. We show that the well-known solution by Fixman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71, 3050 (1974)] is missing a shape-related term, later alluded to but not computed by Helfand [J. Chem. Phys 71, 5000 (1979)]. In our approach, the shape term, also termed zero-point energy, arises explicitly from a careful treatment of the distributional limit. We present a computationally feasible method for the calculation of the shape term and demonstrate its validity in a couple of examples.</description>

      <title>Using operator covariance to disentangle scaling dimensions in lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In critical lattice models, distance ($r$) dependent correlation functions contain power laws $r^{-2\Delta}$ governed by scaling dimensions $\Delta$ of an underlying continuum field theory. In Monte Carlo simulations, the leading dimensions can be extracted by data fitting, which is difficult when two or more powers contribute significantly. Here a method utilizing covariance between multiple lattice operators is developed where the $r$ dependent eigenvalues of the covariance matrix reflect scaling dimensions of individual field operators. This disentangling is demonstrated explicitly for conformal field theories. The scheme is first tested on the critical point of the 2D Ising model, where the two primary scaling dimensions and their respective two lowest descendant dimensions are extracted. The 3D Ising model is studied next, revealing the two relevant primaries and their lowest descendants to high precision. The 2D tricritical Ising point is studied with the Blume-Capel model. Here the scaling dimensions of all three symmetric primary operators are successfully isolated along with the leading descendants. The eigenvectors are also studied and give useful information on the boundary between the ordered and disordered phases in the neighborhood of the tricritical point. Finally, the crossover from regular to tricritical Ising scaling is investigated on several points on the phase boundary of the Blume-Capel model away from its tricritical point. The scaling of the eigenvalues corresponding to tricritical descendant operators are found to be remarkably stable even far from the tricritical point. The covariance method represents a simple extension of standard analysis of correlation functions and can significantly enhance the utility of Monte Carlo simulations and other computational methods in studies of criticality, in particular conformal critical points.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum Dynamics as a Probe for Non-Hermitian Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Systems with Periodic Boundaries</title>

Abstract: It has recently been established that open quantum systems may exhibit a strong spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the non-Hermitian/Liouvillian skin effect (NHSE/LSE), making the topological properties of the system boundary-condition sensitive. In this Letter, we ask the query: Can topological phase transitions of open quantum systems, captured by open boundary conditioned invariants, be observed in the dynamics of a system in a periodic boundary condition, even in the presence of NHSE/LSE? We affirmatively respond to this question, by considering the quench dynamics of entanglement spectrum in a periodic open quantum fermionic system. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum exhibits zero-crossings only when this periodic system is quenched from a topologically trivial to non-trivial phase, defined from the spectrum in open boundary conditions, even in systems featuring LSE. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian topological phases leave a distinctive imprint on the unconditional dynamics within a subsystem of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric theory of (extended) time-reversal symmetries in stochastic processes -- Part II: field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the time-reversal properties of a generic Markovian stochastic field dynamics with Gaussian noise. We introduce a convenient functional geometric formalism that allows us to straightforwardly generalize known results from finite dimensional systems to the case of continuous fields. We give, at field level, full reversibility conditions for three notions of time-reversal defined in the first article of this two-part series, namely T-, MT-, and EMT-reversibility. When the noise correlator is invertible, these reversibility conditions do not make reference to any generically unknown function like the stationary probability, and can thus be verified systematically. Focusing on the simplest of these notions, where only the time variable is flipped upon time reversal, we show that time-reversal symmetry breaking is quantified by a single geometric object: the vorticity two-form, which is a two-form over the functional space $\mathbb{F}$ to which the field belongs. Reversibility then amounts to the cancellation of this vorticity two-form. This condition applies at distributional level and can thus be difficult to use in practice. For fields that are defined on a spatial domain of dimension $d=1$, we overcome this problem by building a basis of the space of two-forms $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$. Reversibility is then equivalent to the vanishing of the vorticity's coordinates in this basis, a criterion that is readily applicable to concrete examples. Furthermore, we show that this basis provides a natural direct-sum decomposition of $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$, each subspace of which is associated with a distinctive kind of phenomenology. This decomposition enables a classification of celebrated out-of-equilibrium phenomena, ranging from non-reciprocal (chaser/chased) interactions to the flocking of active agents, dynamical reaction-diffusion patterns, (...)</description>

      <title>Strange relaxation and metastable behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell</title>

Abstract: We have studied the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behaviours of the Ising ferromagnetic thick cubic shell by Monte Carlo simulation. Our goal is to find the dependence of the responses on the thickness of the shell. In the equilibrium results, we found that the pseudo-critical temperature of ferro-para phase transition of thick cubic shell increases with the increase of the thickness following a hyperbolic tangent relation. In the nonequilibrium studies, the relaxation time has been found to decrease with the increase of the thickness of the cubic shell. Here three different regimes are found, namely rapid fall, plateau and linear region. The metastable behaviour has been studied also as another kind of non-equilibrium response. The metastable lifetime has been studied as function of the thickness of the cubic shell. A non-monotonic variation of metastable lifetime with the thickness of the shell is observed. A specified thickness for longest-lived metastability has been identified.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Test for Quantum Integrability and Nonintegrability</title>

Abstract: The integrability of a quantum many-body system, which is characterized by the presence or absence of local conserved quantities, drastically impacts the dynamics of isolated systems, including thermalization. Nevertheless, a rigorous and comprehensive method for determining integrability or nonintegrability has remained elusive. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing rigorously provable tests for integrability and nonintegrability of quantum spin systems with finite-range interactions. Our results significantly simplify existing proofs of nonintegrability, such as those for the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with nearest-and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic chain and the $S=1/2$ XYZ model in two or higher dimensions. Moreover, our results also yield the first proof of nonintegrability for models such as the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain with a non-uniform magnetic field, the $S=1/2$ XYZ model on the triangular lattice, and the general spin XYZ model. This work also offers a partial resolution to the long-standing conjecture that integrability is governed by the existence of local conserved quantities with small support. Our framework ensures that the nonintegrability of one-dimensional spin systems with translational symmetry can be verified algorithmically, independently of system size.</description>

      <title>A Microcanonical Inflection Point Analysis via Parametric Curves and its Relation to the Zeros of the Partition Function</title>

Abstract: In statistical physics, phase transitions are arguably among the most extensively studied phenomena. In the computational approach to this field, the development of algorithms capable of estimating entropy across the entire energy spectrum in a single execution has highlighted the efficacy of microcanonical inflection point analysis, while Fisher's zeros technique has re-emerged as a powerful methodology for investigating these phenomena. This paper presents an alternative protocol for analyzing phase transitions using a parameterization of entropy function in the microcanonical ensemble. We also provide a clear demonstration of the relation of the linear pattern of the Fisher's zeros on the complex inverse temperature map (a circle in the complex $x=e^{-\beta \varepsilon}$ map) with the order of the transition, showing that the specific heat is inversely related to the distance between the zeros. We study various model systems, including the Lennard-Jones cluster, the Ising, the XY, and the Zeeman models. By examining the behavior of thermodynamic quantities such as entropy and its derivatives in the microcanonical ensemble, we identify key features - such as loops and discontinuities in parametric curves - which signal phase transitions' presence and nature. We are confident that this approach can facilitate the classification of phase transitions across various physical systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-size corrections from the subleading magnetic scaling field for the Ising and Potts models in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In finite-size scaling analyses of critical phenomena, proper consideration of correction terms, which can come from different sources, plays an important role. For the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the $Q$-state Potts model in two dimensions, although the subleading magnetic scaling field, with exactly known exponent, is theoretically expected to give rise in finite-size-scaling analyses, numerical observation remains elusive probably due to the mixing of various corrections. We simulate the O($n$) loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is in the same universality class as the $Q=n^2$ Potts model but has suppressed corrections from other sources, and provides strong numerical evidence for the attribution of the subleading magnetic field in finite-size corrections. Interestingly, it is also observed that the corrections in small- and large-cluster-size regions have opposite magnitudes, and, for the special $n=2$ case, they compensate with each other in observables like the second moment of the cluster-size distribution. Our finding reveals that the effect of the subleading magnetic field should be taken into account in finite-size-scaling analyses, which was unfortunately ignored in many previous studies.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we examine the impact of time-varying temperature and force on the thermodynamic features of active Brownian motor that moves with velocity against the force as well as passive Brownian motor. By deriving analytical expressions In this work, we examine the impact of time-varying temperature and force on the thermodynamic features of active Brownian motor that moves with velocity against the force as well as passive Brownian motor. By deriving analytical expressions for entropy production and entropy extraction rates, we extend the existing theoretical frameworks by considering a force or temperature that varies exponentially, linearly, and quadratically. By studying the system analytically, we investigate how thermal relaxation, steady-state conditions, and nonlinear dissipation effects are affected over time. We find that the total entropy depends only on temperature and viscous friction if the Brownian particle moves freely, while the entropy production and dissipation rates are strongly influenced by the external force.</description>

Abstract: We study the performance of quantum thermal machines in which the working fluid of the model is represented by a many-body quantum system that is periodically connected with external baths via local couplings. A formal characterization of the limit cycles of the set-up is presented in terms of the mixing properties of the quantum channel that describes the evolution of the fluid over a thermodynamic cycle. For the special case in which the system is a collection of spin 1/2 particles coupled via magnetization preserving Hamiltonians, a full characterization of the possible operational regimes (i.e., thermal engine, refrigerator, heater and thermal accelerator) is provided: in this context we show in fact that the different regimes only depend upon a limited number of parameters (essentially the ratios of the energy gaps associated with the local Hamiltonians of the parts of the network which are in direct thermal contact with the baths).</description>

      <title>Equilibration of Topological Defects Near the Deconfined Quantum Multicritical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum criticality (DQC) arises from fractionalization of quasi-particles and leads to fascinating behaviors beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson description of phase transitions. Here, we study the critical dynamics when driving a two-dimensional quantum magnet through a weakly first-order transition point near a putative deconfined multicritical point separating antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states. Numerical simulations show that the conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) mechanism is inadequate for describing the annealing process. We introduce the concept of dual asymmetric KZS, where both a pseudocritical relaxation time and the deconfinement time enter and the scaling also depends on the driving direction according to a duality principle connecting the topological defects in the two phases. These defects require a much longer time scale for equilibration than the amplitude of the order parameter. Beyond advancing the DQC scenario, our scaling approach provides a new window into out-of-equilibrium criticality with multiple length and time scales.</description>

Abstract: Thermalization phenomena, while ubiquitous in quantum systems, have traditionally been viewed as obstacles to be mitigated. In this study, we demonstrate the ability, instead, to harness thermalization to dynamically engineer and stabilize structured quantum states in a mesoscopically large ensemble of spins. Specifically, we showcase the capacity to generate, control, stabilize, and read out 'shell-like' spin texture with interacting $ {}^{ 13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spins in diamond, wherein spins are polarized oppositely on either side of a critical radius. The texture spans several nanometers and encompasses many hundred spins. We capitalize on the thermalization process to impose a quasi-equilibrium upon the generated texture; as a result, it is highly stable, immune to spin diffusion, and endures over multiple-minute long periods -- over a million times longer than the intrinsic interaction scale of the spins. Additionally, the texture is created and interrogated without locally controlling or probing the nuclear spins. These features are accomplished using an electron spin as a nanoscale injector of spin polarization, and employing it as a source of spatially varying dissipation, allowing for serial readout of the emergent spin texture. Long-time stabilization is achieved via prethermalization to a Floquet-induced Hamiltonian under the electronic gradient field. Our work presents a new approach to robust nanoscale spin state engineering and paves the way for new applications in quantum simulation, quantum information science, and nanoscale imaging.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics of our brains in dynamically driven disordered superconducting loop networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19279v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Numerical simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems, leading to two universal laws describing the nature of information dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition can be understood from generic properties. We demonstrate the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for this transition to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in Safety-Critical Systems with Probabilistic Initial Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We often rely on probabilistic measures--e.g. event probability or expected time--to characterize systems safety. However, determining these quantities for extremely low-probability events is generally challenging, as standard safety methods usually struggle due to conservativeness, high-dimension scalability, tractability or numerical limitations. We address these issues by leveraging rigorous approximations grounded in the principles of Large Deviations theory. By assuming deterministic initial conditions, Large Deviations identifies a single dominant path as the most significant contributor to the rare-event probability: the instanton. We extend this result to incorporate stochastic uncertainty in the initial states, which is a common assumption in many applications. To that end, we determine an expression for the probability density of the initial states, conditioned on the instanton--the most dominant path hitting the unsafe region--being observed. This expression gives access to the most probable initial conditions, as well as the most probable hitting time and path deviations, leading to an unsafe rare event. We demonstrate its effectiveness by solving a high-dimensional and non-linear problem: a space collision.</description>

Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanometers thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

      <title>Finite Correlation Length Scaling of Disorder Parameter at Quantum Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disorder parameter, defined as the expectation value of the symmetry transformation acting on a subsystem, can be used to characterize symmetric phases as an analogy to detecting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phases using local order parameters. In a dual picture, disorder parameters actually detect SSB of higher-form symmetries. In this work, we show that the non-local disorder parameters can be conveniently and efficiently evaluated using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS). Moreover, we propose a finite correlation length scaling theory of the disorder parameter within the quantum critical region and validate the scaling theory with variationally optimized iPEPS. We find from the finite correlation length scaling that the disorder parameter satisfies perimeter law at a critical point, i.e., it decays exponentially with the boundary size of the subsystem, indicating spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking at the critical point of the dual model.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>

Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Deconfined criticality as intrinsically gapless topological state in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered One Dimensional Critical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Langevin equation and the Mori projection operator technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In statistical physics, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism (also called Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism) is used to derive a linear integro-differential equation for observables in Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. We prove that the GLE together with the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT) uniquely define the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. The GLE and 2FDT are an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear Volterra equations. They neither rely on the Dyson identity nor on the concept of orthogonal dynamics. This holds true for autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. Further results are obtained for the Mori projection for autonomous systems, for which the fluctuating forces are orthogonal to the observable of interest. In particular, we prove that the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\overline{\mathcal{QL}}Q$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\mathcal{P}=1-\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. As a consequence, the corresponding orbit maps (e.g. the fluctuating forces) are the unique mild solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonal dynamics is a unitary group, if $\mathcal{L}$ is skew-adjoint. In this case, the fluctuating forces are stationary. In addition, we present a proof of the GLE by means of semigroup theory, and we retrieve the commonly used definitions for the fluctuating forces, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems, whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup. This includes large classes of systems in classical statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

      <title>A Clue on Small-Capacitance Josephson Junction: What to Expect from Cooper Pair Ideal Conductor and Ohmic Resistor in Parallel?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using analytical and Worldline Monte Carlo approaches, we investigate the effects induced by quantum phase fluctuations combined with quasiparticle subgap and shunt resistances on a small-capacitance Josephson junction. By using the linear response theory in the presence of two biasing schemes, we prove that the ideal conduction, foreseen in the pioneering papers on this topic, is not robust against either quantum phase fluctuations or dissipative effects. By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an increase of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic equilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic equilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle motion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to localized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly believed. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle changes from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the environment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge response function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the transition. Consequences beyond the linear response regime are investigated, leading to an alternative comprehensive physical picture for this system: we predict a transition from a dissipative quasiparticle current to a polaronic Cooper pair current.</description>

      <title>Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.</description>

      <title>How does the entanglement entropy of a many-body quantum system change after a single measurement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For one-dimensional free Dirac fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after the saturation time, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurement protocols. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength supporting that in all cases the EE is in the area law phase. Another distinct feature of the distribution is its spatial inhomogeneity. In the weak monitoring limit, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support for boundary point separating the two subsystems defining the EE while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, the distribution is Gaussian for weak monitoring. As the monitoring strength increases, it gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. In the strong monitoring limit, the tails are still exponential but the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect. For all monitoring strengths, the distribution is size independent.</description>

      <title>Non-local charges from perturbed defects via SymTFT in 2d CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional conformal field theories from the point of view of the 3d SymTFT of the unperturbed theory. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which results in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations, such that the perturbed line defects are conserved in the perturbed CFT. In other words, the perturbed defects are rigidly translation invariant, and such defects form a monoidal category which extends the topological symmetries. As examples we study the A-type Virasoro minimal models $M(p,q)$. Our formalism provides one-parameter families of commuting non-local conserved charges for perturbations by a primary bulk field with Kac label $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, or $(1,5)$, which are the standard integrable perturbations of minimal models. We find solutions to the commutation condition also for other bulk perturbations, such as $(1,7)$, and we contrast this with the existence of local conserved charges. There has been recent interest in the possibility that in certain cases perturbations by fields such as $(1,7)$ can be integrable, and our construction provides a new way in which integrability can be found without the need for local conserved charges.</description>
