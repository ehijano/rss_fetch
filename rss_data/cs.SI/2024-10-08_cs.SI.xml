      <title>Enabling Asymptotic Truth Learning in a Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a network of agents that all want to guess the correct value of some ground truth state. In a sequential order, each agent makes its decision using a single private signal which has a constant probability of error, as well as observations of actions from its network neighbors earlier in the order. We are interested in enabling \emph{network-wide asymptotic truth learning} -- that in a network of $n$ agents, almost all agents make a correct prediction with probability approaching one as $n$ goes to infinity. In this paper we study both random orderings and carefully crafted decision orders with respect to the graph topology as well as sufficient or necessary conditions for a graph to support such a good ordering. We first show that on a sparse graph of average constant degree with a random ordering asymptotic truth learning does not happen. We then show a rather modest sufficient condition to enable asymptotic truth learning. With the help of this condition we characterize graphs generated from the Erd\"os R\'enyi model and preferential attachment model. In an Erd\"os R\'enyi graph, unless the graph is super sparse (with $O(n)$ edges) or super dense (nearly a complete graph), there exists a decision ordering that supports asymptotic truth learning. Similarly, any preferential attachment network with a constant number of edges per node can achieve asymptotic truth learning under a carefully designed ordering but not under either a random ordering nor the arrival order. We also evaluated a variant of the decision ordering on different network topologies and demonstrated clear effectiveness in improving truth learning over random orderings.</description>

      <title>Modeling Social Media Recommendation Impacts Using Academic Networks: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of social media has highlighted potential negative impacts on society and individuals, largely driven by recommendation algorithms that shape user behavior and social dynamics. Understanding these algorithms is essential but challenging due to the complex, distributed nature of social media networks as well as limited access to real-world data. This study proposes to use academic social networks as a proxy for investigating recommendation systems in social media. By employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we develop a model that separates the prediction of academic infosphere from behavior prediction, allowing us to simulate recommender-generated infospheres and assess the model's performance in predicting future co-authorships. Our approach aims to improve our understanding of recommendation systems' roles and social networks modeling. To support the reproducibility of our work we publicly make available our implementations: https://github.com/DimNeuroLab/academic_network_project</description>

      <title>The Role of Social Support and Influencers in Social Media Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can individual agents coordinate their actions to achieve a shared objective in distributed systems? This challenge spans economic, technical, and sociological domains, each confronting scalability, heterogeneity, and conflicts between individual and collective goals. In economic markets, a common currency facilitates coordination, raising the question of whether such mechanisms can be applied in other contexts. This paper explores this idea within social media platforms, where social support (likes, shares, comments) acts as a currency that shapes content production and sharing. We investigate two key questions: (1) Can social support serve as an effective coordination tool, and (2) What role do influencers play in content creation and dissemination? Our formal analysis shows that social support can coordinate user actions similarly to money in economic markets. Influencers serve dual roles, aggregating content and acting as information proxies, guiding content producers in large markets. While imperfections in information lead to a "price of influence" and suboptimal outcomes, this price diminishes as markets grow, improving social welfare. These insights provide a framework for understanding coordination in distributed environments, with applications in both sociological systems and multi-agent AI systems.</description>

      <title>BCIM: Budget and capacity constrained influence maximization in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence maximization (IM) seeks to identify a seed set that maximizes influence within a network, with applications in areas such as viral marketing, disease control, and political campaigns. The budgeted influence maximization (BIM) problem extends IM by incorporating cost constraints for different nodes. However, the current BIM problem, limited by budget alone, often results in the selection of numerous low-cost nodes, which may not be applicable to real-world scenarios. Moreover, considering that users can transmit information across multiple social platforms, solving the BIM problem across these platforms could lead to more optimized resource utilization. To address these challenges, we propose the Budget and Capacity Constrained Influence Maximization (BCIM) problem within multilayer networks and introduce a Multilayer Multi-population Genetic Algorithm (MMGA) to solve it. The MMGA employs modules, such as initialization, repair, and parallel evolution, designed not only to meet budget and capacity constraints but also to significantly enhance algorithmic efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and empirical multilayer networks demonstrate that MMGA improves spreading performance by at least 10% under the two constraints compared to baselines extended from classical IM problems. The BCIM framework introduces a novel direction in influence maximization, providing an effective and efficient solution to the problem.</description>

      <title>Integrated or Segregated? User Behavior Change after Cross-Party Interactions on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been a widely shared concern that social media reinforces echo chambers of like-minded users and exacerbate political polarization. While fostering interactions across party lines is recognized as an important strategy to break echo chambers, there is a lack of empirical evidence on whether users will actually become more integrated or instead more segregated following such interactions on real social media platforms. We fill this gap by inspecting how users change their community engagement after receiving a cross-party reply in the U.S. politics discussion on Reddit. More specifically, we investigate if they increase their activity in communities of the opposing party, or in communities of their own party. We find that receiving a cross-party reply to a comment in a non-partisan discussion space is not significantly associated with increased out-party subreddit activity, unless the comment itself is already a reply to another comment. Meanwhile, receiving a cross-party reply is significantly associated with increased in-party subreddit activity, but the effect is comparable to that of receiving a same-party reply. Our results reveal a highly conditional depolarization effect following cross-party interactions in spurring activity in out-party communities, which is likely part of a more general dynamic of feedback-boosted engagement.</description>

      <title>icon: Fast Simulation of Epidemics on Coevolving Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fast simulation technique for modeling epidemics on adaptive networks. Our rejection-based algorithm efficiently simulates the co-evolution of the network structure and the epidemic dynamics. We extend the classical SIS model by incorporating stochastic rules that allow for the association of susceptible nodes and the dissociation of infected nodes. The method outperforms standard baselines in terms of computational efficiency while revealing new emergent patterns in epidemic spread.

      <description>arXiv:2410.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock markets are impacted by a large variety of factors including news and discussions among investors about investment opportunities. With the emergence of social media, new opportunities for having financial discussions arose. The market frenzy surrounding GameStop (GME) on the Reddit subreddit Wallstreetbets, caused financial discussion forums to receive widespread attention and it was established that Wallstreetbets played a leading role in the stock market movements of GME. Here, we present a new data set for exploring the effect of social media discussion forums on the stock market. The dataset consists of posts published on various Reddit subreddits concerning the popular meme stocks GameStop (GME), American Multi-Cinema Entertainment Holdings (AMC), and BlackBerry (BB). We document the data collection and processing steps and show that the posts and comments about these meme stocks are related to their market movements.</description>

      <title>Matrix-weighted networks for modeling multidimensional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks are powerful tools for modeling interactions in complex systems. While traditional networks use scalar edge weights, many real-world systems involve multidimensional interactions. For example, in social networks, individuals often have multiple interconnected opinions that can affect different opinions of other individuals, which can be better characterized by matrices. We propose a novel, general framework for modeling such multidimensional interacting dynamics: matrix-weighted networks (MWNs). We present the mathematical foundations of MWNs and examine consensus dynamics and random walks within this context. Our results reveal that the coherence of MWNs gives rise to non-trivial steady states that generalize the notions of communities and structural balance in traditional networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present SeeSay, an assistive device designed for individuals with visual impairments. This system leverages large language models (LLMs) for speech recognition and visual querying. It effectively identifies, records, and responds to the user's environment by providing audio guidance using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our experiments demonstrate the system's capability to recognize its surroundings and respond to queries with audio feedback in diverse settings. We hope that the SeeSay system will facilitate users' comprehension and recollection of their surroundings, thereby enhancing their environmental perception, improving navigational capabilities, and boosting overall independence.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models can Achieve Social Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social balance is a concept in sociology which states that if every three individuals in a population achieve certain structures of positive or negative interactions, then the whole population ends up in one faction of positive interactions or divided between two or more antagonistic factions. In this paper, we consider a group of interacting large language models (LLMs) and study how, after continuous interactions, they can achieve social balance. Across three different LLM models, we found that social balance depends on (i) whether interactions are updated based on "relationships", "appraisals", or "opinions"; (ii) whether agents update their interactions based on homophily or influence from their peers; and (iii) the number of simultaneous interactions the LLMs consider. When social balance is achieved, its particular structure of positive or negative interactions depends on these three conditions and are different across LLM models and sizes. The stability of interactions and the justification for their update also vary across models. Thus, social balance is driven by the pre-training and alignment particular to each LLM model.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Future Link Prediction in Quantum Computing Semantic Networks through LLM-Initiated Node Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly evolving in both physics and computer science, offering the potential to solve complex problems and accelerate computational processes. The development of quantum chips necessitates understanding the correlations among diverse experimental conditions. Semantic networks built on scientific literature, representing meaningful relationships between concepts, have been used across various domains to identify knowledge gaps and novel concept combinations. Neural network-based approaches have shown promise in link prediction within these networks. This study proposes initializing node features using LLMs to enhance node representations for link prediction tasks in graph neural networks. LLMs can provide rich descriptions, reducing the need for manual feature creation and lowering costs. Our method, evaluated using various link prediction models on a quantum computing semantic network, demonstrated efficacy compared to traditional node embedding techniques.</description>

      <title>Entity Insertion in Multilingual Linked Corpora: The Case of Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Links are a fundamental part of information networks, turning isolated pieces of knowledge into a network of information that is much richer than the sum of its parts. However, adding a new link to the network is not trivial: it requires not only the identification of a suitable pair of source and target entities but also the understanding of the content of the source to locate a suitable position for the link in the text. The latter problem has not been addressed effectively, particularly in the absence of text spans in the source that could serve as anchors to insert a link to the target entity. To bridge this gap, we introduce and operationalize the task of entity insertion in information networks. Focusing on the case of Wikipedia, we empirically show that this problem is, both, relevant and challenging for editors. We compile a benchmark dataset in 105 languages and develop a framework for entity insertion called LocEI (Localized Entity Insertion) and its multilingual variant XLocEI. We show that XLocEI outperforms all baseline models (including state-of-the-art prompt-based ranking with LLMs such as GPT-4) and that it can be applied in a zero-shot manner on languages not seen during training with minimal performance drop. These findings are important for applying entity insertion models in practice, e.g., to support editors in adding links across the more than 300 language versions of Wikipedia.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Impact of Local Homophily on GNN Fairness: In-Depth Analysis and New Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to generalize when graphs exhibit both homophily (same-class connections) and heterophily (different-class connections). Specifically, GNNs tend to underperform for nodes with local homophily levels that differ significantly from the global homophily level. This issue poses a risk in user-centric applications where underrepresented homophily levels are present. Concurrently, fairness within GNNs has received substantial attention due to the potential amplification of biases via message passing. However, the connection between local homophily and fairness in GNNs remains underexplored. In this work, we move beyond global homophily and explore how local homophily levels can lead to unfair predictions. We begin by formalizing the challenge of fair predictions for underrepresented homophily levels as an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. We then conduct a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how local homophily levels can alter predictions for differing sensitive attributes. We additionally introduce three new GNN fairness benchmarks, as well as a novel semi-synthetic graph generator, to empirically study the OOD problem. Across extensive analysis we find that two factors can promote unfairness: (a) OOD distance, and (b) heterophilous nodes situated in homophilous graphs. In cases where these two conditions are met, fairness drops by up to 24% on real world datasets, and 30% in semi-synthetic datasets. Together, our theoretical insights, empirical analysis, and algorithmic contributions unveil a previously overlooked source of unfairness rooted in the graph's homophily information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of internet access across various aspects of life, from remote work and online education to healthcare services and social connections. As we transition to a post-pandemic era, a pressing need arises to update our understanding of the multifaceted nature of internet access. This study is one of the first attempts to do so. Using survey data from New Zealand adult internet users (n=960), it compares internet connection types, frequency of internet use at home, social media use, and concerns about online risk between people with and without disabilities. Results show people with disabilities have restricted fibre access and higher wireless broadband (a much slower connection type). People with disabilities use social media platforms less and are more concerned about certain online risks. The findings highlight persistent disparities in internet access for people with disabilities in the post-pandemic era. Implications of the study are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The advent of increasingly-growing virtual realities poses unprecedented opportunities and challenges to different societies. Artistic collectives are not an exception, and we here aim to put special attention into musicians. Compositions, lyrics and even show-advertisements are constituents of a message that artists transmit about their reality. As such, artistic creations are ultimately linked to feelings and emotions, with aesthetics playing a crucial role when it comes to transmit artist's intentions. In this context, we here analyze how virtual realities can help to broaden the opportunities for musicians to bridge with their audiences, by devising a dynamical fashion-design recommendation system inspired by sound stimulus. We present our first steps towards re-defining musical experiences in the metaverse, opening up alternative opportunities for artists to connect both with real and virtual (\textit{e.g.} machine-learning agents operating in the metaverse) in potentially broader ways.</description>

      <title>Limits of Multilayer Diffusion Network Inference in Social Media Research</title>

Abstract: Information on social media spreads through an underlying diffusion network that connects people of common interests and opinions. This diffusion network often comprises multiple layers, each capturing the spreading dynamics of a certain type of information characterized by, for example, topic, language, or attitude. Researchers have previously proposed methods to infer these underlying multilayer diffusion networks from observed spreading patterns, but little is known about how well these methods perform across the range of realistic spreading data. In this paper, we conduct an extensive series of synthetic data experiments to systematically analyze the performance of the multilayer diffusion network inference framework, under varied network structure (e.g. density, number of layers) and information diffusion settings (e.g. cascade size, layer mixing) that are designed to mimic real-world spreading on social media. Our results show extreme performance variation of the inference framework: notably, it achieves much higher accuracy when inferring a denser diffusion network, while it fails to decompose the diffusion network correctly when most cascades in the data reach a limited audience. In demonstrating the conditions under which the inference accuracy is extremely low, our paper highlights the need to carefully evaluate the applicability of the inference before running it on real data. Practically, our results serve as a reference for this evaluation, and our publicly available implementation, which outperforms previous implementations in accuracy, supports further testing under personalized settings.</description>

      <title>Orphan Articles: The Dark Matter of Wikipedia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With 60M articles in more than 300 language versions, Wikipedia is the largest platform for open and freely accessible knowledge. While the available content has been growing continuously at a rate of around 200K new articles each month, very little attention has been paid to the accessibility of the content. One crucial aspect of accessibility is the integration of hyperlinks into the network so the articles are visible to readers navigating Wikipedia. In order to understand this phenomenon, we conduct the first systematic study of orphan articles, which are articles without any incoming links from other Wikipedia articles, across 319 different language versions of Wikipedia. We find that a surprisingly large extent of content, roughly 15\% (8.8M) of all articles, is de facto invisible to readers navigating Wikipedia, and thus, rightfully term orphan articles as the dark matter of Wikipedia. We also provide causal evidence through a quasi-experiment that adding new incoming links to orphans (de-orphanization) leads to a statistically significant increase of their visibility in terms of the number of pageviews. We further highlight the challenges faced by editors for de-orphanizing articles, demonstrate the need to support them in addressing this issue, and provide potential solutions for developing automated tools based on cross-lingual approaches. Overall, our work not only unravels a key limitation in the link structure of Wikipedia and quantitatively assesses its impact, but also provides a new perspective on the challenges of maintenance associated with content creation at scale in Wikipedia.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Framework for Attributed Network Clustering via K-Nearest Neighbor Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attributed networks containing entity-specific information in node attributes are ubiquitous in modeling social networks, e-commerce, bioinformatics, etc. Their inherent network topology ranges from simple graphs to hypergraphs with high-order interactions and multiplex graphs with separate layers. An important graph mining task is node clustering, aiming to partition the nodes of an attributed network into k disjoint clusters such that intra-cluster nodes are closely connected and share similar attributes, while inter-cluster nodes are far apart and dissimilar. It is highly challenging to capture multi-hop connections via nodes or attributes for effective clustering on multiple types of attributed networks. In this paper, we first present AHCKA as an efficient approach to attributed hypergraph clustering (AHC). AHCKA includes a carefully-crafted K-nearest neighbor augmentation strategy for the optimized exploitation of attribute information on hypergraphs, a joint hypergraph random walk model to devise an effective AHC objective, and an efficient solver with speedup techniques for the objective optimization. The proposed techniques are extensible to various types of attributed networks, and thus, we develop ANCKA as a versatile attributed network clustering framework, capable of attributed graph clustering (AGC), attributed multiplex graph clustering (AMGC), and AHC. Moreover, we devise ANCKA with algorithmic designs tailored for GPU acceleration to boost efficiency. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare our methods with 19 competitors on 8 attributed hypergraphs, 16 competitors on 6 attributed graphs, and 16 competitors on 3 attributed multiplex graphs, all demonstrating the superb clustering quality and efficiency of our methods.</description>

      <title>Uncovering multi-order Popularity and Similarity Mechanisms in Link Prediction by graphlet predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Link prediction has become a critical problem in network science and has thus attracted increasing research interest. Popularity and similarity are two primary mechanisms in the formation of real networks. However, the roles of popularity and similarity mechanisms in link prediction across various domain networks remain poorly understood. Accordingly, this study used orbit degrees of graphlets to construct multi-order popularity- and similarity-based network link predictors, demonstrating that traditional popularity- and similarity-based indices can be efficiently represented in terms of orbit degrees. Moreover, we designed a supervised learning model that fuses multiple orbit-degree-based features and validated its link prediction performance. We also evaluated the mean absolute Shapley additive explanations of each feature within this model across 550 real-world networks from six domains. We observed that the homophily mechanism, which is a similarity-based feature, dominated social networks, with its win rate being 91\%. Moreover, a different similarity-based feature was prominent in economic, technological, and information networks. Finally, no single feature dominated the biological and transportation networks. The proposed approach improves the accuracy and interpretability of link prediction, thus facilitating the analysis of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Fast Estimation of Temporal Motifs using Path Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counting the number of small subgraphs, called motifs, is a fundamental problem in social network analysis and graph mining. Many real-world networks are directed and temporal, where edges have timestamps. Motif counting in directed, temporal graphs is especially challenging because there are a plethora of different kinds of patterns. Temporal motif counts reveal much richer information and there is a need for scalable algorithms for motif counting.
  A major challenge in counting is that there can be trillions of temporal motif matches even with a graph with only millions of vertices. Both the motifs and the input graphs can have multiple edges between two vertices, leading to a combinatorial explosion problem. Counting temporal motifs involving just four vertices is not feasible with current state-of-the-art algorithms.
  We design an algorithm, TEACUPS, that addresses this problem using a novel technique of temporal path sampling. We combine a path sampling method with carefully designed temporal data structures, to propose an efficient approximate algorithm for temporal motif counting. TEACUPS is an unbiased estimator with provable concentration behavior, which can be used to bound the estimation error. For a Bitcoin graph with hundreds of millions of edges, TEACUPS runs in less than 1 minute, while the exact counting algorithm takes more than a day. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy of TEACUPS on large datasets, showing an average of 30$\times$ speedup (up to 2000$\times$ speedup) compared to existing GPU-based exact counting methods while preserving high count estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network structure has a large impact on constant-selection evolutionary dynamics, with which multiple types of fitness (i.e., strength) compete on the network. Here we study constant-selection dynamics on two-layer networks in which the fitness of a node in one layer affects that in the other layer, under birth-death processes and uniform initialization, which are commonly assumed. We show mathematically and numerically that two-layer networks are suppressors of selection, which means that they suppress the effects of the different fitness values among the different types on the final outcomes of the evolutionary dynamics (called fixation probability) relative to the constituent one-layer networks. In fact, many two-layer networks are suppressors of selection relative to the most basic baseline, the Moran process. This result is in stark contrast with the results for conventional one-layer networks for which most networks are amplifiers of selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of social media necessitates reliable and efficient detection of offensive content to mitigate harmful effects. Although sophisticated models perform well on individual datasets, they often fail to generalize due to varying definitions and labeling of "offensive content." In this paper, we introduce HateCOT, an English dataset with over 52,000 samples from diverse sources, featuring explanations generated by GPT-3.5Turbo and curated by humans. We demonstrate that pretraining on HateCOT significantly enhances the performance of open-source Large Language Models on three benchmark datasets for offensive content detection in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, despite differences in domain and task. Additionally, HateCOT facilitates effective K-shot fine-tuning of LLMs with limited data and improves the quality of their explanations, as confirmed by our human evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world graphs often evolve over time, making community or cluster detection a crucial task. In this technical report, we extend three dynamic approaches - Naive-dynamic (ND), Delta-screening (DS), and Dynamic Frontier (DF) - to our multicore implementation of the Leiden algorithm, known for its high-quality community detection. Our experiments, conducted on a server with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, show that ND, DS, and DF Leiden achieve average speedups of 1.37x, 1.47x, and 1.98x on large graphs with random batch updates, compared to the Static Leiden algorithm - while scaling at a rate of 1.6x for every doubling of threads. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply dynamic approaches to the Leiden algorithm. We hope these early results pave the way for further development of dynamic approaches for evolving graphs.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Distance Between Graphs: A Spectral Metric for Assessing the Stability of Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a spectral framework for assessing the generalization and stability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing a Graph Geodesic Distance (GGD) metric. For two different graphs with the same number of nodes, our framework leverages a spectral graph matching procedure to find node correspondence so that the geodesic distance between them can be subsequently computed by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem associated with their Laplacian matrices. For graphs with different sizes, a resistance-based spectral graph coarsening scheme is introduced to reduce the size of the bigger graph while preserving the original spectral properties. We show that the proposed GGD metric can effectively quantify dissimilarities between two graphs by encapsulating their differences in key structural (spectral) properties, such as effective resistances between nodes, cuts, the mixing time of random walks, etc. Through extensive experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art metrics, such as the latest Tree-Mover's Distance (TMD) metric, the proposed GGD metric shows significantly improved performance for stability evaluation of GNNs especially when only partial node features are available.</description>

      <title>Mental Disorder Classification via Temporal Representation of Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mental disorders pose a global challenge, aggravated by the shortage of qualified mental health professionals. Mental disorder prediction from social media posts by current LLMs is challenging due to the complexities of sequential text data and the limited context length of language models. Current language model-based approaches split a single data instance into multiple chunks to compensate for limited context size. The predictive model is then applied to each chunk individually, and the most voted output is selected as the final prediction. This results in the loss of inter-post dependencies and important time variant information, leading to poor performance. We propose a novel framework which first compresses the large sequence of chronologically ordered social media posts into a series of numbers. We then use this time variant representation for mental disorder classification. We demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our framework by outperforming the current SOTA in three different mental conditions: depression, self-harm, and anorexia, with an absolute improvement of 5% in the F1 score. We investigate the situation where current data instances fall within the context length of language models and present empirical results highlighting the importance of temporal properties of textual data. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed framework for a cross-domain study, exploring commonalities across disorders and the possibility of inter-domain data usage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the years, the number of users of social media has increased drastically. People frequently share their thoughts through social platforms, and this leads to an increase in hate content. In this virtual community, individuals share their views, express their feelings, and post photos, videos, blogs, and more. Social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter provide platforms to share vast amounts of content with a single click. However, these platforms do not impose restrictions on the uploaded content, which may include abusive language and explicit images unsuitable for social media. To resolve this issue, a new idea must be implemented to divide the inappropriate content. Numerous studies have been done to automate the process. In this paper, we propose a new Bi-GRU-CNN model to classify whether the text is offensive or not. The combination of the Bi-GRU and CNN models outperforms the existing model.</description>

      <title>Neural Collaborative Filtering to Detect Anomalies in Human Semantic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a wide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health. However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models are applied to recommendation tasks such as items to buy and news articles to read. Point of Interest is quite a new area to sequential recommendation based on language representations of multimodal datasets. As a first step to prove our concepts, we focused on restaurant recommendation based on each user's past visit history. When choosing a next restaurant to visit, a user would consider genre and location of the venue and, if available, pictures of dishes served there. We created a pseudo restaurant check-in history dataset from the Foursquare dataset and the FoodX-251 dataset by converting pictures into text descriptions with a multimodal model called LLaVA, and used a language-based sequential recommendation framework named Recformer proposed in 2023. A model trained on this semi-multimodal dataset has outperformed another model trained on the same dataset without picture descriptions. This suggests that this semi-multimodal model reflects actual human behaviours and that our path to a multimodal recommendation model is in the right direction.</description>
