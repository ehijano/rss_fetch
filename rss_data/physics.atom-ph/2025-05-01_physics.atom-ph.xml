      <title>Electron beam characterization via fluorescence imaging of Rydberg states in atomic vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an all-optical, minimally invasive method for electron beam (e-beam) characterization using Rydberg electrometry. The e-beam passes through a dilute Rb vapor prepared in a quantum superposition of ground and Rydberg states that reduces resonant absorption in a narrow spectral region. Imaging the modifications of Rb fluorescence due to shifts in the Rydberg state from the e-beam electric field allows us to reconstruct e-beam width, centroid position, and current. We experimentally demonstrate this technique using a 20 keV e-beam in the range of currents down to 20 $\mu$A, and discuss technical challenges produced by environmental electric potentials in the detection chamber. Overall, we demonstrate the promising potential of such an approach as a minimally invasive diagnostic for charged particle beams.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Dressing of Rydberg States in a Trapped Calcium Ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are using optical- and microwave-fields to excite Rydberg states in trapped cold 40Ca+ ions. We employ a single ion and observe spectroscopically in the manifold of a principal quantum number n=49 the dressing of Rydberg states of angular momentum states S and P. We compare our experimental spectra with a multi-level calculation of dressed states and find good agreement. The results are important for controlling the interaction of single ions in Rydberg states with electric fields of the ion trap, and for tailoring the interactions in an ion crystal in Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Steering reaction flux by coupling product channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for controlling the outcome of an ultracold chemical few-body reaction by redirecting a tunable fraction of reaction flux from one selected product channel to another one. In the reaction, three ultracold atoms collide to form a diatomic molecule. This product molecule can be produced in various internal states, characterizing the different product channels of the reaction. Our scheme relies on the coupling between two such product channels at an avoided molecular energy level crossing in the presence of an external magnetic field. The degree of coupling can be set by the magnetic field strength and allows for a widely tunable flux control between the two channels. This scheme is quite general and also holds great promise for a large variety of chemical processes with diverse species, since molecular energy level crossings are ubiquitous in molecular systems and are often easily accessible by standard laboratory equipment.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Anomalies in the Electronic Stopping of Slow Antiprotons in LiF', arXiv:2501.14381</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work contains detailed discussions on the contents of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 076401 (2025), in the following denoted PRL134. In this comment, we revisit and elaborate on the Adiabatic Ionization Model (AIM) for the energy loss of antiparticles in matter, with particular reference to its theoretical foundation as established previously. The AIM framework plays a central role in describing the ionization dynamics in the low-velocity regime considered by the authors of PRL134. Calculated AIM results for the energy loss of antiprotons in LiF crystals are compared to experimental data and different other models, pointing to severe problems of the PRL134 results.
  Beyond this specific comparative theoretical investigation, we critically examine several statements and assumptions made in PRL134. Certain claims presented therein appear to be inconsistent with established theoretical principles or are insufficiently justified by the data and arguments provided. As such, we believe that further clarification, and in some cases, a more rigorous justification, is necessary to substantiate those points.</description>

      <title>Observation of Time Crystal in a Spin Maser System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair interaction potentials between atoms in a crystal are in general non-monotonic in distance, with a local minimum whose position gives the lattice constant of the crystal. A temporal analogue of this idea of crystal formation is still pending despite intensive studies on the time crystal phase. In a hybrid spin maser system with a time delay feedback, we report the observation of a time crystal induced by a retarded interaction with a characteristic time scale. This nonequilibrium phase features a self-sustained oscillation with an emergent frequency other than the intrinsic Larmor precession frequency of the spin maser system. It is shown that the amplitude of the oscillation is robust against perturbation, while its time phase randomly distributes from 0 to $2\pi$ for different realizations, a signature of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking. This time crystal phase emerges only when the feedback strength exceeds a critical value, at which the system experiences a first order phase transition. Such a retarded interaction induced time crystal is closer to the idea of crystal, compared to other time crystal realizations.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of light atoms and bounds on physics beyond the standard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newly calculated bounds on the strength of the coupling of an electron to a proton or a neutron by a fifth force are presented. These results are derived from the high precision spectroscopic data currently available for hydrogen, deuterium, helium-3 and helium-4. They do not depend on specific assumptions on how the interaction would couple to a deuteron compared to a proton or would couple to an $\alpha$ particle compared to a helion. They depend on its coupling to a muon, but not in a significant way for carrier masses below 100~keV if one assumes that the strength of the interaction with a muon would be of a similar order of magnitude as the strength of the interaction with an electron in that mass region.</description>

      <title>Systematic Bayesian Optimization for Atomic Structure Calculations of Heavy Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel optimisation technique for atomic structure calculations using the Flexible Atomic Code, focussing on complex multielectron systems relevant to $r$-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova modelling. We introduce a method to optimise the fictitious mean configuration used in the Flexible Atomic Code, significantly improving the accuracy of calculated energy levels and transition properties for lanthanide and actinide ions. Our approach employs a Sequential Model-Based Optimisation algorithm to refine the fictitious mean configuration, iteratively minimising the discrepancy between calculated and experimentally determined energy levels. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through detailed analyses of Au II, Pt II, Pr II, Pr III, Er II, and Er~III, representing a broad range of atomic configurations. The results show substantial improvements in the accuracy of the calculated energy levels, with average relative differences to the NIST data reduced from 20-60\% to 10\% or less for the ions studied. Transition wavelength calculations exhibit exceptional agreement with experimental data, with about 90\% of the calculated values falling within 10\% of measurements for Pr and Er ions. While improvements in transition probability calculations are observed, the calculated transition probabilities (log($gf$) values) still show significant discrepancies compared to the experimental data, with root mean square deviations of approximately 1.1-1.4 dex for Pr and Er ions. We extend our optimisation technique to systematic calculations of singly and doubly ionised lanthanides, achieving accuracies comparable to or surpassing those of \textit{ab-initio} atomic structure codes. The method's broad applicability across the lanthanide series demonstrates its potential for enhancing opacity calculations and spectral modelling in astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning at Heisenberg Limit for Hybrid Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems with different particle species are fundamental in quantum materials and quantum information science. In this work, we establish a rigorous theoretical framework proving that, given access to an unknown spin-boson type Hamiltonian, our algorithm achieves Heisenberg-limited estimation for all coupling parameters up to error $\epsilon$ with a total evolution time ${O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ using only ${O}({\rm polylog}(\epsilon^{-1}))$ measurements. It is also robust against small state preparation and measurement errors. In addition, we provide an alternative algorithm based on distributed quantum sensing, which significantly reduces the evolution time per measurement. To validate our method, we demonstrate its efficiency in hybrid Hamiltonian learning and spectrum learning, with broad applications in AMO, condensed matter and high energy physics. Our results provide a scalable and robust framework for precision Hamiltonian characterization in hybrid quantum platforms.</description>
