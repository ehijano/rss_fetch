      <title>Election Polls on Social Media: Prevalence, Biases, and Voter Fraud Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms allow users to create polls to gather public opinion on diverse topics. However, we know little about what such polls are used for and how reliable they are, especially in significant contexts like elections. Focusing on the 2020 presidential elections in the U.S., this study shows that outcomes of election polls on Twitter deviate from election results despite their prevalence. Leveraging demographic inference and statistical analysis, we find that Twitter polls are disproportionately authored by older males and exhibit a large bias towards candidate Donald Trump relative to representative mainstream polls. We investigate potential sources of biased outcomes from the point of view of inauthentic, automated, and counter-normative behavior. Using social media experiments and interviews with poll authors, we identify inconsistencies between public vote counts and those privately visible to poll authors, with the gap potentially attributable to purchased votes. We also find that Twitter accounts participating in election polls are more likely to be bots, and election poll outcomes tend to be more biased, before the election day than after. Finally, we identify instances of polls spreading voter fraud conspiracy theories and estimate that a couple thousand of such polls were posted in 2020. The study discusses the implications of biased election polls in the context of transparency and accountability of social media platforms.</description>

      <title>SeBot: Structural Entropy Guided Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Social Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in social bot detection have been driven by the adoption of Graph Neural Networks. The social graph, constructed from social network interactions, contains benign and bot accounts that influence each other. However, previous graph-based detection methods that follow the transductive message-passing paradigm may not fully utilize hidden graph information and are vulnerable to adversarial bot behavior. The indiscriminate message passing between nodes from different categories and communities results in excessively homogeneous node representations, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of social bot detectors. In this paper, we propose SEBot, a novel multi-view graph-based contrastive learning-enabled social bot detector. In particular, we use structural entropy as an uncertainty metric to optimize the entire graph's structure and subgraph-level granularity, revealing the implicitly existing hierarchical community structure. And we design an encoder to enable message passing beyond the homophily assumption, enhancing robustness to adversarial behaviors of social bots. Finally, we employ multi-view contrastive learning to maximize mutual information between different views and enhance the detection performance through multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of social bot detection compared with SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Effective Clustering on Large Attributed Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attributed bipartite graphs (ABGs) are an expressive data model for describing the interactions between two sets of heterogeneous nodes that are associated with rich attributes, such as customer-product purchase networks and author-paper authorship graphs. Partitioning the target node set in such graphs into k disjoint clusters (referred to as k-ABGC) finds widespread use in various domains, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. However, the majority of existing solutions towards k-ABGC either overlook attribute information or fail to capture bipartite graph structures accurately, engendering severely compromised result quality. The severity of these issues is accentuated in real ABGs, which often encompass millions of nodes and a sheer volume of attribute data, rendering effective k-ABGC over such graphs highly challenging.
  In this paper, we propose TPO, an effective and efficient approach to k-ABGC that achieves superb clustering performance on multiple real datasets. TPO obtains high clustering quality through two major contributions: (i) a novel formulation and transformation of the k-ABGC problem based on multi-scale attribute affinity specialized for capturing attribute affinities between nodes with the consideration of their multi-hop connections in ABGs, and (ii) a highly efficient solver that includes a suite of carefully-crafted optimizations for sidestepping explicit affinity matrix construction and facilitating faster convergence. Extensive experiments, comparing TPO against 19 baselines over 5 real ABGs, showcase the superior clustering quality of TPO measured against ground-truth labels. Moreover, compared to the state of the arts, TPO is often more than 40x faster over both small and large ABGs.</description>

      <title>Reputation Transfer in the Twitter Diaspora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have witnessed a dynamic landscape of user migration in recent years, fueled by changes in ownership, policy, and user preferences. This paper explores the phenomenon of user migration from established platforms like X/Twitter to emerging alternatives such as Threads, Mastodon, and Truth Social. Leveraging a large dataset from X/Twitter, we investigate the extent of user departure from X/Twitter and the destinations they migrate to. Additionally, we examine whether a user's reputation on one platform correlates with their reputation on another, shedding light on the transferability of digital reputation across social media ecosystems. Overall, we find that users with a large following on X/Twitter are more likely to migrate to another platform; and that their reputation on X/Twitter is highly correlated with reputations on Threads, but not Mastodon or Truth Social.</description>

      <title>BrainStorm @ iREL at SMM4H 2024: Leveraging Translation and Topical Embeddings for Annotation Detection in Tweets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of LLMs in various NLP tasks has sparked debates regarding their reliability, particularly in annotation tasks where biases and hallucinations may arise. In this shared task, we address the challenge of distinguishing annotations made by LLMs from those made by human domain experts in the context of COVID-19 symptom detection from tweets in Latin American Spanish. This paper presents BrainStorm @ iREL's approach to the SMM4H 2024 Shared Task, leveraging the inherent topical information in tweets, we propose a novel approach to identify and classify annotations, aiming to enhance the trustworthiness of annotated data.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Aligning Medical Claims Made on Social Media with Medical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence-based medicine is the practice of making medical decisions that adhere to the latest, and best known evidence at that time. Currently, the best evidence is often found in the form of documents, such as randomized control trials, meta-analyses and systematic reviews. This research focuses on aligning medical claims made on social media platforms with this medical evidence. By doing so, individuals without medical expertise can more effectively assess the veracity of such medical claims. We study three core tasks: identifying medical claims, extracting medical vocabulary from these claims, and retrieving evidence relevant to those identified medical claims. We propose a novel system that can generate synthetic medical claims to aid each of these core tasks. We additionally introduce a novel dataset produced by our synthetic generator that, when applied to these tasks, demonstrates not only a more flexible and holistic approach, but also an improvement in all comparable metrics. We make our dataset, the Expansive Medical Claim Corpus (EMCC), available at https://zenodo.org/records/8321460</description>

      <title>A Starting Point for Dynamic Community Detection with Leiden Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world graphs evolve with time. Identifying communities or clusters on such graphs is an important problem. In this technical report, we extend three dynamic approaches, namely, Naive-dynamic (ND), Delta-screening (DS), and Dynamic Frontier (DF), to our multicore implementation of the Leiden algorithm, an algorithm known for its high-quality community detection. Our experiments on a server with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor demonstrate that ND, DS, and DF Leiden achieve speedups of 1.25x, 1.24x, and 1.37x on large graphs with random batch updates, compared to Static, ND, and DS Leiden, respectively. However, on real-world dynamic graphs, ND Leiden performs the best, being on average 1.14x faster than Static Leiden. We hope our early results serve as a starting point for dynamic approaches to the Leiden algorithm on evolving graphs.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Contrastive Learning: A Survey and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning on graphs has achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, the reliance on annotated graph data remains a significant bottleneck due to its prohibitive cost and time-intensive nature. To address this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs has gained increasing attention and has made significant progress. SSL enables machine learning models to produce informative representations from unlabeled graph data, reducing the reliance on expensive labeled data. While SSL on graphs has witnessed widespread adoption, one critical component, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), has not been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. Thus, this survey aims to fill this gap by offering a dedicated survey on GCL. We provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles of GCL, including data augmentation strategies, contrastive modes, and contrastive optimization objectives. Furthermore, we explore the extensions of GCL to other aspects of data-efficient graph learning, such as weakly supervised learning, transfer learning, and related scenarios. We also discuss practical applications spanning domains such as drug discovery, genomics analysis, recommender systems, and finally outline the challenges and potential future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>PULL: PU-Learning-based Accurate Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an edge-incomplete graph, how can we accurately find the missing links? The link prediction in edge-incomplete graphs aims to discover the missing relations between entities when their relationships are represented as a graph. Edge-incomplete graphs are prevalent in real-world due to practical limitations, such as not checking all users when adding friends in a social network. Addressing the problem is crucial for various tasks, including recommending friends in social networks and finding references in citation networks. However, previous approaches rely heavily on the given edge-incomplete (observed) graph, making it challenging to consider the missing (unobserved) links during training. In this paper, we propose PULL (PU-Learning-based Link predictor), an accurate link prediction method based on the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. PULL treats the observed edges in the training graph as positive examples, and the unconnected node pairs as unlabeled ones. PULL effectively prevents the link predictor from overfitting to the observed graph by proposing latent variables for every edge, and leveraging the expected graph structure with respect to the variables. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PULL consistently outperforms the baselines for predicting links in edge-incomplete graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The network effect, wherein one user's activity impacts another user, is common in social network platforms. Many new features in social networks are specifically designed to create a network effect, enhancing user engagement. For instance, content creators tend to produce more when their articles and posts receive positive feedback from followers. This paper discusses a new cluster-level experimentation methodology for measuring creator-side metrics in the context of A/B experiments. The methodology is designed to address cases where the experiment randomization unit and the metric measurement unit differ. It is a crucial part of LinkedIn's overall strategy to foster a robust creator community and ecosystem. The method is developed based on widely-cited research at LinkedIn but significantly improves the efficiency and flexibility of the clustering algorithm. This improvement results in a stronger capability for measuring creator-side metrics and an increased velocity for creator-related experiments.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Digital Contact Tracing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.05637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital contact tracing plays a crucial role in alleviating an outbreak, and designing multilevel digital contact tracing for a country is an open problem due to the analysis of large volumes of temporal contact data. We develop a multilevel digital contact tracing framework that constructs dynamic contact graphs from the proximity contact data. Prominently, we introduce the edge label of the contact graph as a binary circular contact queue, which holds the temporal social interactions during the incubation period. After that, our algorithm prepares the direct and indirect (multilevel) contact list for a given set of infected persons from the contact graph. Finally, the algorithm constructs the infection pathways for the trace list. We implement the framework and validate the contact tracing process with synthetic and real-world data sets. In addition, analysis reveals that for COVID-19 close contact parameters, the framework takes reasonable space and time to create the infection pathways. Our framework can apply to any epidemic spreading by changing the algorithm's parameters.</description>

      <title>MGL2Rank: Learning to Rank the Importance of Nodes in Road Networks Based on Multi-Graph Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of important nodes with strong propagation capabilities in road networks is a vital topic in urban planning. Existing methods for evaluating the importance of nodes in traffic networks only consider topological information and traffic volumes, the diversity of the traffic characteristics in road networks, such as the number of lanes and average speed of road segments, is ignored, thus limiting their performance. To solve this problem, we propose a graph learning-based framework (MGL2Rank) that integrates the rich characteristics of road networks to rank the importance of nodes. This framework comprises an embedding module containing a sampling algorithm (MGWalk) and an encoder network to learn the latent representations for each road segment. MGWalk utilizes multigraph fusion to capture the topology of road networks and establish associations between road segments based on their attributes. The obtained node representation is then used to learn the importance ranking of the road segments. Finally, a synthetic dataset is constructed for ranking tasks based on the regional road network of Shenyang City, and the ranking results on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The data and source code for MGL2Rank are available at https://github.com/iCityLab/MGL2Rank.</description>

      <title>DF Louvain: Fast Incrementally Expanding Approach for Community Detection on Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of recognizing natural divisions in networks. A relevant challenge in this problem is to find communities on rapidly evolving graphs. In this report we present our Parallel Dynamic Frontier (DF) Louvain algorithm, which given a batch update of edge deletions and insertions, incrementally identifies and processes an approximate set of affected vertices in the graph with minimal overhead, while using a novel approach of incrementally updating weighted-degrees of vertices and total edge weights of communities. We also present our parallel implementations of Naive-dynamic (ND) and Delta-screening (DS) Louvain. On a server with a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor, our experiments show that DF Louvain obtains speedups of 179x, 7.2x, and 5.3x on real-world dynamic graphs, compared to Static, ND, and DS Louvain, respectively, and is 183x, 13.8x, and 8.7x faster, respectively, on large graphs with random batch updates. Moreover, DF Louvain improves its performance by 1.6x for every doubling of threads.</description>
