      <title>The index of sub-laplacians: beyond contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following question: do sub-Laplacian type operators have non-trivial index theory on Carnot manifolds in higher degree of nilpotency? The problem relates to characterizing the structure of the space of hypoelliptic sub-Laplacian type operators, and results going back to Rothschild-Stein and Helffer-Nourrigat. In two degrees of nilpotency, there is a rich index theory by work of van Erp-Baum on contact manifolds, that was later extended to polycontact manifolds by Goffeng-Kuzmin. We provide a plethora of examples in higher degree of nilpotency where the index theory is trivial.</description>

      <title>A motivic Greenlees spectral sequence towards motivic Hochschild homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a motivic Greenlees spectral sequence by characterising an associated $t$-structure. We then examine a motivic version of topological Hochschild homology for the motivic cohomology spectrum modulo a prime number $p$. Finally, we use the motivic Greenlees spectral sequence to determine the homotopy ring of a related spectrum, given that the base field is algebraically closed with a characteristic that is coprime to $p$.</description>

      <title>Relative assembly maps and the K-theory of Hecke algebras in prime characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relative assembly map from the family of finite subgroups to the family of virtually cyclic subgroups for the algebraic $K$-theory of twisted group rings of a group G with coefficients in a regular ring R or, more generally, with coefficients in a regular additive category. They are known to be isomorphisms rationally. We show that it suffices to invert only those primes p for which G contains a non-trivial finite p-group and p is not invertible in R. The key ingredient is the detection of Nil-terms of a twisted group ring of a finite group F after localizing at p in terms of the p-subgroups of F using Verschiebungs and Frobenius operators. We construct and exploit the structure of a module over the ring of big Witt vectors on the Nil-terms. We analyze the algebraic K-theory of the Hecke algebras of subgroups of reductive p-adic groups in prime characteristic.</description>

      <title>Simple homotopy types of even dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a closed $n$-manifold, we consider the set of simple homotopy types of $n$-manifolds within its homotopy type, called its simple homotopy manifold set. We characterise it in terms of algebraic $K$-theory, the surgery obstruction map, and the homotopy automorphisms of the manifold. We use this to construct the first examples, for all $n \ge 4$ even, of closed $n$-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent but not simple homotopy equivalent. In fact, we construct infinite families with pairwise the same properties, and our examples can be taken to be smooth for $n \geq 6$.
  Our key examples are homotopy equivalent to the product of a circle and a lens space. We analyse the simple homotopy manifold sets of these manifolds, determining exactly when they are trivial, finite, and infinite, and investigating their asymptotic behaviour. The proofs involve integral representation theory and class numbers of cyclotomic fields. We also compare with the relation of $h$-cobordism, and produce similar detailed quantitative descriptions of the manifold sets that arise.</description>
