      <title>Explicit Morphisms in the Galois-Tukey Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the Continuum Hypothesis is false, it implies the existence of cardinalities between the integers and the real numbers. In studying these "cardinal characteristics of the continuum", it was discovered that many of the associated inequalities can be interpreted as morphisms within the "Galois-Tukey" category. This thesis aims to reformulate traditional direct proofs of cardinal characteristic inequalities by making the underlying morphisms explicit. New, purely categorical results are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A poset game in submonoids of additively indecomposable ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by arXiv:1705.11034, we consider the Chomp game in a natural poset structure defined in submonoids $\mathcal{S}^\sigma\subseteq\omega^\sigma$ of additively indecomposable ordinals. A fundamental observation is that there exists an ordinal $\xi$ such that, for every class $\langle (\mathcal{S}^\sigma;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\sigma}) \ | \ \sigma\in\text{Ord}\rangle$ of posets generated by a set of natural numbers, the second player has a winning strategy in all those posets or only in $\langle (\mathcal{S}^\sigma;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\sigma}) \ | \ \sigma\in\alpha\rangle$ for some successor ordinal $\alpha\leq\xi$ (and the first player will have a winning strategy in the rest of the posets). This Hanf number-style property could be valuable in proving the existence of winning strategies. We conjecture that $ \xi = 1 $ and, using results from arXiv:1908.09664, we prove that $\xi&lt;\omega_1$. We also explicitly describe a winning strategy for a specific family of classes.</description>

      <title>Iterability for (transfinite) stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.03880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish natural criteria under which normally iterable premice are iterable for stacks of normal trees. Let $\Omega$ be a regular uncountable cardinal. Let $m&lt;\omega$ and $M$ be an $m$-sound premouse and $\Sigma$ be an $(m,\Omega+1)$-iteration strategy for $M$ (roughly, a normal $(\Omega+1)$-strategy). We define a natural condensation property for iteration strategies, "inflation condensation". We show that if $\Sigma$ has inflation condensation then $M$ is $(m,\Omega,\Omega+1)^*$-iterable (roughly, $M$ is iterable for length $\leq\Omega$ stacks of normal trees each of length ${&lt;\Omega}$), and moreover, we define a specific such strategy $\Sigma^{\mathrm{st}}$ and a reduction of stacks via $\Sigma^{\mathrm{st}}$ to normal trees via $\Sigma$. If $\Sigma$ has the Dodd-Jensen property and $\mathrm{card}(M)&lt;\Omega$ then $\Sigma$ has inflation condensation. We also apply some of the techniques developed to prove that if $\Sigma$ has strong hull condensation (introduced independently by John Steel) and $G$ is $V$-generic for an $\Omega$-cc forcing, then $\Sigma$ extends to an $(m,\Omega+1)$-strategy $\Sigma^+$ for $M$ with strong hull condensation, in the sense of $V[G]$. Moreover, this extension is unique. We deduce that if $G$ is $V$-generic for a ccc forcing then $V$ and $V[G]$ have the same $\omega$-sound, $(\omega,\Omega+1)$-iterable premice which project to $\omega$.</description>

      <title>The definability of the extender sequence $\mathbb{E}$ from $\mathbb{E}{\upharpoonright}\aleph_1$ in $L[\mathbb{E}]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.00276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a short extender mouse. We prove that if $E\in M$ and $M$ satisfies "$E$ is a countably complete short extender whose support is a cardinal $\theta$ and $\mathcal{H}_\theta\subseteq\mathrm{Ult}(V,E)$", then $E$ is in the extender sequence $\mathbb{E}^M$ of $M$. We also prove other related facts, and use them to establish that if $\kappa$ is an uncountable cardinal of $M$ and $\kappa^{+M}$ exists in $M$ then $(\mathcal{H}_{\kappa^+})^M$ satisfies the Axiom of Global Choice.
  We prove that if $M$ satisfies the Power Set Axiom then $\mathbb{E}^M$ is definable over the universe of $M$ from the parameter $X=\mathbb{E}^M\upharpoonright\aleph_1^M$, and $M$ satisfies "every set is $\mathrm{OD}_{\{X\}}$". We also prove various local versions of this fact in which $M$ has a largest cardinal, and a version for generic extensions of $M$.
  As a consequence, for example, the minimal proper class mouse with a Woodin limit of Woodin cardinals models "$V=\mathrm{HOD}$". This adapts to many other similar examples.
  We also describe a simplified approach to Mitchell-Steel fine structure, which does away with the parameters $u_n$.</description>

      <title>Goldstern's principle about unions of null sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goldstern showed in his 1993 paper that the union of a real-parametrized, monotone family of Lebesgue measure zero sets has also Lebesgue measure zero provided that the sets are uniformly $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^1_1$. Our aim is to study to what extent we can drop the $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^1_1$ assumption. We show Goldstern's principle for the pointclass $\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$ holds. We show that Goldstern's principle for the pointclass of all subsets is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ and show its negation follows from $\mathsf{CH}$. Also we prove that Goldstern's principle for the pointclass of all subsets holds both under $\mathsf{ZF} + \mathsf{AD}$ and in Solovay models.</description>

      <title>Any function I can actually write down is measurable, right?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this expository paper aimed at a general mathematical audience, we discuss how to combine certain classic theorems of set-theoretic inner model theory and effective descriptive set theory with work on Hilbert's tenth problem and universal Diophantine equations to produce the following surprising result: There is a specific polynomial $p(x,y,z,n,k_1,\dots,k_{70})$ of degree $7$ with integer coefficients such that it is independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ (and much stronger theories) whether the function $$f(x) = \inf_{y \in \mathbb{R}}\sup_{z \in \mathbb{R}}\inf_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\sup_{\bar{k} \in \mathbb{N}^{70}}p(x,y,z,n,\bar{k})$$ is Lebesgue measurable. We also give similarly defined $g(x,y)$ with the property that the statement "$x \mapsto g(x,r)$ is measurable for every $r \in \mathbb{R}$" has large cardinal consistency strength (and in particular implies the consistency of $\mathsf{ZFC}$) and $h(m,x,y,z)$ such that $h(1,x,y,z),\dots,h(16,x,y,z)$ can consistently be the indicator functions of a Banach$\unicode{x2013}$Tarski paradoxical decomposition of the sphere.
  Finally, we discuss some situations in which measurability of analogously defined functions can be concluded by inspection, which touches on model-theoretic o-minimality and the fact that sufficiently strong large cardinal hypotheses (such as Vop\v{e}nka's principle and much weaker assumptions) imply that all 'reasonably definable' functions (including the above $f(x)$, $g(x,y)$, and $h(m,x,y,z)$) are universally measurable.</description>

      <title>Material Interpretation and Constructive Analysis of Maximal Ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents the concept of material interpretation as a method to transform classical proofs into constructive ones. Using the case study of maximal ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$, it demonstrates how a classical implication $A \to B$ can be rephrased as a constructive disjunction $\neg A \vee B$, with $\neg A$ representing a strong form of negation. The approach is based on on G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, the strong negation, and potentially Herbrand disjunctions. The classical proof that every maximal ideal in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ contains a prime number is revisited, highlighting its reliance on non-constructive principles such as the law of excluded middle. A constructive proof is then developed, replacing abstract constructs with explicit case distinctions and direct computations in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$. This proof clarifies the logical structure and reveals computational content. The article discusses broader applications, such as Zariski's Lemma, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, and the Universal Krull-Lindenbaum Lemma, with an emphasis on practical implementation using tools such as Python and proof assistants. The material interpretation offers a promising framework for bridging classical and constructive mathematics, enabling algorithmic implementations.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Fractal Numbers and the Classical Continuum Hypothesis (CH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reinterpretation of the continuum grounded in the stratified structure of definability rather than classical cardinality. In this framework, a real number is not an abstract point on the number line, but an object expressible at some level Fn of a formal hierarchy. We introduce the notion of "fractal numbers" -- entities defined not within a fixed set-theoretic universe, but through layered expressibility across constructive systems. This reconceptualizes irrationality as a relative property, depending on definability depth, and replaces the binary dichotomy between countable and uncountable sets with a gradated spectrum of definability classes. We show that the classical Continuum Hypothesis loses its force in this context: between aleph_0 and c lies not a single cardinal jump, but a stratified sequence of definitional stages, each forming a countable yet irreducible approximation to the continuum. We argue that the real line should not be seen as a completed totality but as an evolving architecture of formal expressibility. We conclude with a discussion of rational invariants, the relativity of irrationality, and the emergence of a fractal metric for definitional density.</description>

      <title>Varieties of MV-monoids and positive MV-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MV-monoids are algebras $\langle A,\vee,\wedge, \oplus,\odot, 0,1\rangle$ where $\langle A, \vee, \wedge, 0, 1\rangle$ is a bounded distributive lattice, both $\langle A, \oplus, 0 \rangle$ and $\langle A, \odot, 1\rangle$ are commutative monoids, and some further connecting axioms are satisfied. Every MV-algebra in the signature $\{\oplus,\neg,0\}$ is term equivalent to an algebra that has an MV-monoid as a reduct, by defining, as standard, $1:= \neg 0$, $x \odot y := \neg(\neg x \oplus\neg y)$, $x \vee y := (x \odot \neg y) \oplus y$ and $x \wedge y := \neg(\neg x \vee \neg y)$. Particular examples of MV-monoids are positive MV-algebras, i.e. the $\{\vee, \wedge, \oplus, \odot, 0, 1\}$-subreducts of MV-algebras. Positive MV-algebras form a peculiar quasivariety in the sense that, albeit having a logical motivation (being the quasivariety of subreducts of MV-algebras), it is not the equivalent quasivariety semantics of any logic. In this paper, we study the lattices of subvarieties of MV-monoids and of positive MV-algebras. In particular, we characterize and axiomatize all almost minimal varieties of MV-monoids, we characterize the finite subdirectly irreducible positive MV-algebras, and we characterize and axiomatize all varieties of positive MV-algebras.</description>
