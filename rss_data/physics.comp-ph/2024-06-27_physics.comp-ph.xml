      <title>Understanding the Impact of openPMD on BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Code, through Instrumentation, Monitoring, and In-Situ Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo simulations on large-scale systems play a fundamental role in understanding the complexities of plasma dynamics in fusion devices. Efficient handling and analysis of vast datasets are essential for advancing these simulations. Previously, we addressed this challenge by integrating openPMD with BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo code, streamlining data streaming and storage. This integration not only enhanced data management but also improved write throughput and storage efficiency. In this work, we delve deeper into the impact of BIT1 openPMD BP4 instrumentation, monitoring, and in-situ analysis. Utilizing cutting-edge profiling and monitoring tools such as gprof, CrayPat, Cray Apprentice2, IPM, and Darshan, we dissect BIT1's performance post-integration, shedding light on computation, communication, and I/O operations. Fine-grained instrumentation offers insights into BIT1's runtime behavior, while immediate monitoring aids in understanding system dynamics and resource utilization patterns, facilitating proactive performance optimization. Advanced visualization techniques further enrich our understanding, enabling the optimization of BIT1 simulation workflows aimed at controlling plasma-material interfaces with improved data analysis and visualization at every checkpoint without causing any interruption to the simulation.</description>

      <title>ViPErLEED package I: Calculation of $I(V)$ curves and structural optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a widely used technique in surface-science. Yet, it is rarely used to its full potential. The quantitative information about the surface structure, contained in the modulation of the intensities of the diffracted beams as a function of incident electron energy, LEED I(V), is underutilized. To acquire these data, minor adjustments would be required in most experimental setups, but existing analysis software is cumbersome to use. ViPErLEED (Vienna package for Erlangen LEED) lowers these barriers, introducing a combined solution for data acquisition, extraction, and computational analysis. These parts are discussed in three separate publications. Here, the focus is on the computational part of ViPErLEED, which performs automated LEED-I(V) calculations and structural optimization. Minimal user input is required, and the functionality is significantly enhanced compared to existing solutions. Computation is performed by embedding the Erlangen tensor-LEED package (TensErLEED). ViPErLEED manages parallelization, monitors convergence, and processes input and output. This makes LEED I(V) more accessible to new users while minimizing the potential for errors and the manual labor. Added functionality includes structure-dependent defaults, automatic detection of bulk and surface symmetries and their relationship, automated symmetry-preserving search procedures, adjustments to the TensErLEED code to handle larger systems, as well as parallelization and optimization. Modern file formats are used as input and output, and there is a direct interface to the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package. The software is implemented primarily in Python (version &gt;=3.7) and provided as an open-source package (GNU GPLv3 or later). A structure determination of the $\alpha$-Fe2O3(1-102)-(1x1) surface is presented as an example for the application of the software.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multiphase Flow Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Model Driven Initializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid fluid simulation approach that integrates generative diffusion models with physics-based simulations, aiming at reducing the computational costs of flow simulations while still honoring all the physical properties of interest. These simulations enhance our understanding of applications such as assessing hydrogen and CO$_2$ storage efficiency in underground reservoirs. Nevertheless, they are computationally expensive and the presence of nonunique solutions can require multiple simulations within a single geometry. To overcome the computational cost hurdle, we propose a hybrid method that couples generative diffusion models and physics-based modeling. We introduce a system to condition the diffusion model with a geometry of interest, allowing to produce variable fluid saturations in the same geometry. While training the model, we simultaneously generate initial conditions and perform physics-based simulations using these conditions. This integrated approach enables us to receive real-time feedback on a single compute node equipped with both CPUs and GPUs. By efficiently managing these processes within one compute node, we can continuously evaluate performance and stop training when the desired criteria are met. To test our model, we generate realizations in a real Berea sandstone fracture which shows that our technique is up to 4.4 times faster than commonly used flow simulation initializations.</description>

      <title>Efficient point-based simulation of four-way coupled particles in turbulence at high number density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many natural and industrial applications, turbulent flows encompass some form of dispersed particles. Although this type of multiphase turbulent flow is omnipresent, its numerical modeling has proven to be a remarkably challenging problem. Models that fully resolve the particle phase are computationally very expensive, strongly limiting the number of particles that can be considered in practice. This warrants the need for efficient reduced order modeling of the complex system of particles in turbulence that can handle high number densities of particles. Here, we present an efficient method for point-based simulation of particles in turbulence that are four-way coupled. In contrast with traditional one-way coupled simulations, where only the effect of the fluid phase on the particle phase is modeled, this method additionally captures the back-reaction of the particle phase on the fluid phase, as well as the interactions between particles themselves. We focus on the most challenging case of very light particles or bubbles, which show strong clustering in the high-vorticity regions of the fluid. This strong clustering poses numerical difficulties which are systematically treated in our work. Our method is valid in the limit of small particles with respect to the Kolmogorov scales of the flow and is able to handle very large number densities of particles. This methods paves the way for comprehensive studies of the collective effect of small particles in fluid turbulence for a multitude of applications.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of frustrated Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions in generalized triangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model with nearest-neighbor interaction $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ in two kinds of generalized triangular lattices (GTLs) employing the Wang--Landau Monte Carlo method and finite-size scaling analysis. In the first GTL (GTL1), featuring anisotropic properties, we identify three kinds of super-antiferromagnetic ground states with stripe structures. Meanwhile, in the second GTL (GTL2), which is non-regular in next-nearest-neighbor interaction, the ferrimagnetic 3$\times$3 and two kinds of partial spin liquid ground states are observed. We confirm that residual entropy is proportional to the number of spins in the partial spin liquid ground states. Additionally, we construct finite-temperature phase diagrams for ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. In GTL1, the transition into the ferromagnetic phase is continuous, contrasting with the first-order transition into the stripe phase. In GTL2, the critical temperature into the ferromagnetic ground state decreases as antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interaction intensifies until it meets the 3$\times$3 phase boundary. For intermediate values of the next-nearest-neighbor interaction, two successive transitions emerge: one from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase, followed by the other transition from the ferromagnetic phase to the 3$\times$3 phase.</description>

      <title>Refining Potential Energy Surface through Dynamical Properties via Differentiable Molecular Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning potentials (MLP) largely enhances the reliability of molecular dynamics, but its accuracy is limited by the underlying $\textit{ab initio}$ methods. A viable approach to overcome this limitation is to refine the potential by learning from experimental data, which now can be done efficiently using modern automatic differentiation technique. However, potential refinement is mostly performed using thermodynamic properties, leaving the most accessible and informative dynamical data (like spectroscopy) unexploited. In this work, through a comprehensive application of adjoint and gradient truncation methods, we show that both memory and gradient explosion issues can be circumvented in many situations, so the dynamical property differentiation is well-behaved. Consequently, both transport coefficients and spectroscopic data can be used to improve the density functional theory based MLP towards higher accuracy. Essentially, this work contributes to the solution of the inverse problem of spectroscopy by extracting microscopic interactions from vibrational spectroscopic data.</description>
