      <title>High-accuracy Measurements of Core-excited Transitions in Light Li-like Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition energies of the two $1s$-core-excited soft X-ray lines (dubbed q and r) from $1s^2 2s ^1S_{1/2}$ to the respective upper levels $1s(^{2}S)2s2p(^{3}P) ^{2}P_{3/2}$ and $^{2}P_{1/2}$ of Li-like oxygen, fluorine and neon were measured and calibrated using several nearby transitions of He-like ions. The major remaining source of energy uncertainties in monochromators, the periodic fluctuations produced by imperfect angular encoder calibration, is addressed by a simultaneously running photoelectron spectroscopy measurement. This leads to an improved energy determination of 5 parts per million, showing fair agreement with previous theories as well as with our own, involving a complete treatment of the autoionizing states studied here. Our experimental results translate to an uncertainty of only 1.6\,km/s for the oxygen line qr-blend used to determine the outflow velocities of active galactic nuclei, ten times smaller than previously possible.</description>

      <title>Hanle effect for lifetime determinations in the soft X-ray regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By exciting a series of $1\mathrm{s}^{2}\, ^{1}\mathrm{S}_{0} \to 1\mathrm{s}n\mathrm{p}\, ^{1}\mathrm{P}_{1}$ transitions in helium-like nitrogen ions with linearly polarized monochromatic soft X-rays at the Elettra facility, we found a change in the angular distribution of the fluorescence sensitive to the principal quantum number $n$. In particular it is observed that the ratio of emission in directions parallel and perpendicular to the polarization of incident radiation increases with higher $n$. We find this $n$-dependence to be a manifestation of the Hanle effect, which served as a practical tool for lifetime determinations of optical transitions since its discovery in 1924. In contrast to traditional Hanle effect experiments, in which one varies the magnetic field and considers a particular excited state, we demonstrate a 'soft X-ray Hanle effect' which arises in a static magnetic field but for a series of excited states. By comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions, we were able to determine lifetimes ranging from hundreds of femtoseconds to tens of picoseconds of the $1\mathrm{s}n\mathrm{p}\, ^{1}\mathrm{P}_{1}$ levels, which find excellent agreement with atomic-structure calculations. We argue that dedicated soft X-ray measurements could yield lifetime data that is beyond current experimental reach and cannot yet be predicted with sufficient accuracy.</description>

      <title>Observation of electric field induced superradiance slowdown in ultracold Rydberg atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atoms excited to electronically high-lying Rydberg states decay to low-energy states through spontaneous emission processes. We investigate the impact of a static electric field on the superradiant emission process between Rydberg $|60D_{5/2}\rangle$ and $|61P_{3/2}\rangle$ states in an ultracold Cesium Rydberg atom ensemble. We report experimental observations of a significant slowdown in superradiance upon applying an electric field. To understand the slowing down dynamics, we employ a discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) method to solve the corresponding master equation numerically. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that superradiance decoherence is caused by the Stark shifts of the Rydberg level. Our theoretical simulations qualitatively match the experimental observations. Our work provides new insights into controlling quantum critical behaviors, with implications for quantum many-body dynamics, and the study of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a recently established setup for laser spectroscopy at CRYRING@ESR at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research. Here, laser spectroscopy can be performed on stored and cooled ion bunches and coasting beams. First spectra of $^{24,25}$Mg$^+$ ions are presented that were recorded by classical Doppler-limited fluorescence spectroscopy as well as $\Lambda$-spectroscopy using counter- and copropagating laser beams that are Doppler-shifted by several nm.</description>

      <title>A low-power microstructured atomic oven for alkaline-earth-like elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkaline-earth-like elements play pivotal roles in advanced quantum sensing technologies, notably optical clocks, with unprecedented precision achieved in recent years. Despite remarkable progress, current optical lattice clocks still face challenges in meeting the demanding size, weight, and power consumption constraints essential for space applications. Conventional atom sources, such as ovens or dispensers, require substantial heating power, making up a significant fraction of the system's overall power consumption. Addressing this challenge, we present a novel microstructured atomic oven based on fused silica, designed for miniaturization and low-power operation. We characterize the oven by loading a magneto-optical trap with Yb evaporated from the oven and demonstrate operation with a loading rate above $10^8$ $\mathrm{atoms}/\mathrm{s}$ for heating powers below $250$ $\mathrm{mW}$.</description>

      <title>Improved precision and accuracy of electron energy-loss spectroscopy quantification via fine structure fitting with constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By working out the Bethe sum rule, a boundary condition that takes the form of a linear equality is derived for the fine structure observed in ionization edges present in electron energy-loss spectra. This condition is subsequently used as a constraint in the estimation process of the elemental abundances, demonstrating starkly improved precision and accuracy and reduced sensitivity to the number of model parameters. Furthermore, the fine structure is reliably extracted from the spectra in an automated way, thus providing critical information on the sample's electronic properties that is hard or impossible to obtain otherwise. Since this approach allows dispensing with the need for user-provided input, a potential source of bias is prevented.</description>

      <title>Coherent all X-ray four wave mixing at core shell resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear wave mixing in the X-ray range can provide valuable insights into the structural and electron dynamics of atomic and molecular systems on ultrafast time scales, with state- and site-selectivity and atomic resolution. This promising experimental toolbox was so far limited by requiring at least one near-visible laser, thus preventing core-shell two-dimensional X-ray spectroscopy. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of background-free all-X-ray four-wave mixing (XFWM) signals from a dilute gaseous sample (Ne). The measured and simulated two-dimensional spectral maps ($\omega_{\text{in}},\omega_{\text{out}}$) show multiple contributions involving the coherent response from core electrons. Notably, two-color resonant XFWM signals, essential for generalized multi-color schemes that allow to locally probe the electronic excitation of matter, are observed in neutral Ne. Moreover, stimulated Ne$^+$ emission in each of the propagating X-ray pulses leads to an increase of the temporal coherence in a narrow-bandwidth, which results in the coherent mixing of three X-ray lasers. Preliminary X-ray excitation experiments making use of multi-color time-delayed X-ray pulses demonstrate temporal resolution capability and show a time dependency consistent with a signal dominated by resonant XFWM processes. This first all-X-ray four-wave-mixing approach represents a major breakthrough towards multidimensional X-ray correlation spectroscopy and the general application of nonlinear all-X-ray wave-mixing.</description>

      <title>Cooperative atomic emission from a line of atoms interacting with a resonant plane surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative effects such as super- and subradiance can be observed in the fluorescence emitted by a system of N atoms in vacuum, after interaction with a laser beam. In the vicinity of a dielectric or metallic surface, Casimir-Polder effects can modify collective atomic frequency shifts and decay rates. In this work, we study cooperative fluorescent emission next to resonant surfaces using the coupled dipoles model. We show that cooperative effects, expected in free space, are absent when the atoms are close to a surface whose polariton resonances coincide with the dominant atomic dipole coupling. In this case, cooperative effects are overshadowed by the very fast decay of the atomic fluorescence into surface modes. We illustrate our formalism and our results by considering a line of cesium 6D3/2 atoms in front of a sapphire surface. Finally, we propose the study of Cesium 6P3/2 atoms in front of a resonant metasurface as the most promising scenario for experimentally demonstrating the results of our study.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically-Induced-Transparency Cooling of High-Nuclear-Spin Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling of $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ ions with a nuclear spin of $I=3/2$, which are a good candidate of qubits for future large-scale trapped ion quantum computing. EIT cooling of atoms or ions with a complex ground-state level structure is challenging due to the lack of an isolated $\Lambda$ system, as the population can escape from the $\Lambda$ system to reduce the cooling efficiency. We overcome this issue by leveraging an EIT pumping laser to repopulate the cooling subspace, ensuring continuous and effective EIT cooling. We cool the two radial modes of a single $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ ion to average motional occupations of 0.08(5) and 0.15(7) respectively. Using the same laser parameters, we also cool all the ten radial modes of a five-ion chain to near their ground states. Our approach can be adapted to atomic species possessing similar level structures. It allows engineering of the EIT Fano-like spectrum, which can be useful for simultaneous cooling of modes across a wide frequency range, aiding in large-scale trapped-ion quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Full non-LTE spectral line formation III. The case of a two-level atom with broadened upper level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider the full nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiation transfer problem. This formalism allows us to account for deviation from equilibrium distribution of both the radiation field and the massive particles. In the present study two-level atoms with broadened upper level represent the massive particles. In the absence of velocity-changing collisions, we demonstrate the analytic equivalence of the full non-LTE source function with the corresponding standard non-LTE partial frequency redistribution (PFR) model. We present an iterative method based on operator splitting techniques to numerically solve the problem at hand. We benchmark it against the standard non-LTE transfer problem for a two-level atom with PFR. We illustrate the deviation of the velocity distribution function of excited atoms from the equilibrium distribution. We also discuss the dependence of the emission profile and the velocity distribution function on elastic collisions and velocity-changing collisions.</description>

      <title>Finite-order method to calculate approximate density matrices in the Fock-space multireference coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient approach to calculate approximate pure-state and transition reduced density matrices in the framework of the multireference relativistic Fock-space coupled cluster (FS CC) theory is proposed. The method is based on the effective operator formalism and consists of the direct substitution of the FS CC Ansatz for a wave operator into the effective operator expression with the subsequent truncation of expansion at the terms quadratic in cluster amplitudes. The final density matrix is defined by active-space density matrices of different ranks "dressed" with contributions from cluster operators. The method gives a connected expression for pure-state density matrices, provided that the intermediate normalization condition is fulfilled. Moreover, under some additional assumptions, the connectivity can also be ensured for calculated transition property matrix elements and natural transition spinors. The developed technique allows for fast and accurate calculations of one-particle reduced density matrices for a wide range of electronic states. A pilot application of the new technique to construct averaged atomic natural orbital (ANO) basis sets for fully relativistic electronic structure calculations is presented.</description>
