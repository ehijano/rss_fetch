      <title>Can One Hear the Shape of a Decision Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the connection between an agent's decision problem and her ranking of information structures. We find that a finite amount of ordinal data on the agent's ranking of experiments is enough to identify her (finite) set of undominated actions (up to relabeling and duplication) and the beliefs rendering each such action optimal. An additional smattering of cardinal data, comparing the relative value to the agent of finitely many pairs of experiments, identifies her utility function up to an action-independent payoff.</description>

      <title>Revealing Choice Bracketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.14869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments suggest that people fail to take into account interdependencies between their choices -- they do not broadly bracket. Researchers often instead assume that people narrowly bracket, but existing designs do not test it. We design a novel experiment and revealed preference tests for how someone brackets their choices. In portfolio allocation under risk, social allocation, and induced-value shopping experiments, 40-43% of subjects are consistent with narrow bracketing and 0-16% with broad bracketing. Adjusting for each model's predictive precision, 74% of subjects are best described by narrow bracketing, 13% by broad bracketing, and 6% by intermediate cases.</description>

      <title>Comparative statics with adjustment costs and the le Chatelier principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of monotone comparative statics for models with adjustment costs. We show that comparative-statics conclusions may be drawn under the usual ordinal complementarity assumptions on the objective function, assuming very little about costs: only a mild monotonicity condition is required. We use this insight to prove a general le Chatelier principle: under the ordinal complementarity assumptions, if short-run adjustment is subject to a monotone cost, then the long-run response to a shock is greater than the short-run response. We extend these results to a fully dynamic model of adjustment over time: the le Chatelier principle remains valid, and under slightly stronger assumptions, optimal adjustment follows a monotone path. We apply our results to models of saving, production, pricing, labor supply and investment.</description>

      <title>A General Approach for Computing a Consensus in Group Decision Making That Integrates Multiple Ethical Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of computing a consensus according to multiple ethical principles -- which can include, for example, the principle of maximum freedom associated with the Benthamite doctrine and the principle of maximum fairness associated with the Rawlsian principles -- among the preferences of different individuals in the context of Group-Decision-Making. More formally, we put forward a novel formalisation of the above-mentioned problem based on a multinorm approximation problem that aims at minimising multiple p-metric distance functions, where each parameter p represents a given ethical principle. Our contribution incurs obvious benefits from a social-choice perspective. Firstly, our approach significantly generalises state-of-the-art approaches that were limited to only two ethical principles (p set to one, for maximum freedom, and p set to infinity, for maximum fairness). Secondly, our experimental results considering an established test case demonstrate that our approach is capable, thanks to a novel re-weighting scheme, to compute a multi-norm consensus that takes into account each ethical principle in a balanced way, in contrast with state-of-the-art approaches that were heavily biased towards the p=1 ethical principle</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Signaling with a Resource Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multidimensional signaling (cognitive/non-cognitive) as a sender's portfolio choice with a resource constraint. We establish the existence of a unique monotone D1 equilibrium where the cognitive (non-cognitive) signal increases (decreases) in sender type and the sum of the two increases in sender type. The equilibrium is characterized by two threshold sender types. The low threshold is one where a kink occurs in signaling. The constraint is binding only for sender types above it. The high threshold is the other one, above which all types spend all the resources in cognitive signal with pooling and discontinuity on the top.</description>
