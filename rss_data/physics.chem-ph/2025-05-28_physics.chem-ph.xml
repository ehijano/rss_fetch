      <title>Dissecting Exciton-Polariton Transport in Organic Molecular Crystals: Emerging Conductivity Assisted by Intermolecular Vibrational Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the spectral and transport properties of exciton-polaritons under the explicit influence of intermolecular vibrational coupling, which introduces dynamic disorder. In the context of a one-dimensional molecular chain strongly interacting with a cavity photon, we demonstrate the polaritonic characteristics of the spectral function and its interactions with the electronic band broadened by the coupling disorder. We further dissect the current flux into its bare excitonic contribution and transport via the cavity photon. Our results reveal that the enhancement in the charge carrier mobility and frequency-resolved conductivity stems from the photon-mediated current. More importantly, contrary to the intuition that dynamic disorder hinders transport, intermolecular vibrational coupling can facilitate exciton-polariton transport, offering an additional degree of tunability for material properties.</description>

      <title>Apax: A Flexible and Performant Framework For The Development of Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Atomistic learned potentials in JAX (apax), a flexible and efficient open source software package for training and inference of machine-learned interatomic potentials. Built on the JAX framework, apax supports GPU acceleration and implements flexible model abstractions for fast development. With features such as kernel-based data selection, well-calibrated uncertainty estimation, and enhanced sampling, it is tailored to active learning applications and ease of use. The features and design decisions made in apax are discussed before demonstrating some of its capabilities. First, a data set for the room-temperature ionic liquid EMIM+BF4- is created using active learning. It is highlighted how continuously learning models between iterations can reduce training times up to 85 % with only a minor reduction of the models' accuracy. Second, we show good scalability in a data-parallel training setting. We report that a Gaussian Moment Neural Network model, as implemented in apax, achieves higher accuracy and up to 10 times faster inference times than a performance-optimized Allegro model. A recently published Li3PO4 dataset, reported with comparable accuracy and inference performance metrics, is used as a point of comparison. Moreover, the inference speeds of the available simulation engines are compared. Finally, to highlight the modularity of apax, an equivariant message-passing model is trained as a shallow ensemble and used to perform uncertainty-driven dynamics.</description>

      <title>Solvated electrons in polar liquids as epsilon-near-zero materials tunable in the terahertz frequency range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons in polar liquids give rise to a polaron resonance at a terahertz (THz) frequency \nu_0 depending on electron concentration. The impact of this resonance on light propagation is studied in experiments, where a femtosecond pump pulse generates electrons via multiphoton ionization and a THz probe pulse propagated through the excited sample is detected in a phase-resolved way. We observe a behavior characteristic for epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials with strongly modified phase and group velocities around \nu_0, and a broadening of the THz pulse envelope below \nu_0. Calculations based on a local-field approach reproduce the ENZ behavior.</description>

      <title>Thermophysical Properties and Phase Behavior of CO2 with Impurities: Insight from Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimentally determining thermophysical properties for various compositions commonly found in CO2 transportation systems is extremely challenging. To overcome this challenge, we performed Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CO2 rich mixtures to compute thermophysical properties such as densities, thermal expansion coefficients, isothermal compressibilities, heat capacities, Joule-Thomson coefficients, speed of sound, and viscosities at temperatures (235-313) K and pressures (20-200) bar. We computed thermophysical properties of pure CO2 and CO2 rich mixtures with N2, Ar, H2, and CH4 as impurities (1-10) mol% and showed good agreement with available equations of state (EoS). We showed that impurities decrease the values of thermal expansion coefficients, isothermal compressibilities, heat capacities, and Joule-Thomson coefficients in the gas phase, while these values increase in the liquid and supercritical phases. In contrast, impurities increase the value of speed of sound in the gas phase and decrease it in the liquid and supercritical phases. We present an extensive data set of thermophysical properties for CO2 rich mixtures with various impurities, which will help to design the safe and efficient operation of CO2 transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: library for efficient training, model development and simulation of molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIP) are a novel in silico approach for molecular property prediction, creating an alternative to disrupt the accuracy/speed trade-off of empirical force fields and density functional theory (DFT). In this white paper, we present our MLIP library which was created with two core aims: (1) provide to industry experts without machine learning background a user-friendly and computationally efficient set of tools to experiment with MLIP models, (2) provide machine learning developers a framework to develop novel approaches fully integrated with molecular dynamics tools. The library includes in this release three model architectures (MACE, NequIP, and ViSNet), and two molecular dynamics (MD) wrappers (ASE, and JAX-MD), along with a set of pre-trained organics models. The seamless integration with JAX-MD, in particular, facilitates highly efficient MD simulations, bringing MLIP models significantly closer to industrial application. The library is available on GitHub and on PyPI under the Apache license 2.0.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learned Potentials for Solvation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solvent environments play a central role in determining molecular structure, energetics, reactivity, and interfacial phenomena. However, modeling solvation from first principles remains difficult due to the complex interplay of interactions and unfavorable computational scaling of first-principles treatment with system size. Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have recently emerged as efficient surrogates for quantum chemistry methods, offering first-principles accuracy at greatly reduced computational cost. MLPs approximate the underlying potential energy surface, enabling efficient computation of energies and forces in solvated systems, and are capable of accounting for effects such as hydrogen bonding, long-range polarization, and conformational changes. This review surveys the development and application of MLPs in solvation modeling. We summarize the theoretical basis of MLP-based energy and force predictions and present a classification of MLPs based on training targets, model types, and design choices related to architectures, descriptors, and training protocols. Integration into established solvation workflows is discussed, with case studies spanning small molecules, interfaces, and reactive systems. We conclude by outlining open challenges and future directions toward transferable, robust, and physically grounded MLPs for solvation-aware atomistic modeling.</description>

      <title>A theory for diffusion-controlled reactions within nonequilibrium steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study diffusion-controlled processes in nonequilibrium steady-states, where standard rate theory assumptions break down. Using transition path theory, we generalize the relations between reactive probability fluxes and measures of the rate of the reaction. Stochastic thermodynamics analysis reveals how work constrains the enhancement of rates relative to their equilibrium values. An analytically solvable ion-pairing model under a strong electric field illustrates and validates our approach and theory. These findings provide deeper insights into diffusion-controlled reaction dynamics beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Optical Interference Effect in Strong-field Electronic Coherence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.</description>

      <title>Modified Transfer Matrix Method for the Extraction of Material Properties via Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (1-15 THz).</description>

      <title>Finite-size effects of the excess entropy computed from integrating the radial distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computation of the excess entropy from the second-order density expansion of the entropy holds strictly for infinite systems in the limit of small densities. For the reliable and efficient computation of excess entropy, it is important to understand finite-size effects. Here, expressions to compute excess entropy and Kirkwood-Buff (KB) integrals by integrating the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) in a finite volume are derived, from which Sex and KB integrals in the thermodynamic limit are obtained. The scaling of these integrals with system size is studied. We show that the integrals of excess entropy converge faster than KB integrals. We compute excess entropy from Monte Carlo simulations using the Wang-Ramirez-Dobnikar-Frenkel pair interaction potential by thermodynamic integration and by integration of the RDF. We show that excess entropy computed by integrating the RDF is identical to that of excess entropy computed from thermodynamic integration at low densities, provided the RDF is extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit. At higher densities, differences up to 20% are observed.</description>

      <title>ExoPhoto: A Database of Temperature-Dependent Photodissociation Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the ExoPhoto database (https://exomol.com/exophoto/), an extension of the ExoMol database, specifically developed to address the growing need for high-accuracy, temperature-dependent photodissociation cross section data towards short-UV wavelengths. ExoPhoto combines theoretical models from three major computational databases (ExoMol, UGAMOP and PhoMol) and experimental datasets from two experimental groups, providing extensive wavelength and temperature coverage. ExoPhoto currently includes photodissociation data for 20 molecules: AlH, HCl, HF, MgH, OH, NaO, MgO, O2, AlCl, AlF, CS, HeH+, CO, CO2, H2O, SO2, C2H2, C2H4, H2CO, and NH3, derived from theoretical models and supported by experimental data from 5 databases.
  ExoPhoto also includes detailed data on branching ratios and quantum yields for selected datasets. The data structure of ExoPhoto follows the ExoMol framework, with a consistent naming convention and hierarchical JSON-based organization. Photodissociation cross sections are stored in a set of .photo files which provide data as a function of wavelength with one file for each target molecule temperature. Future developments aim to include more photodissociation cross section data and to provide data for molecules in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE). These will expand the utility of ExoPhoto for advanced astrophysical, planetary modeling and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking as Predicted by a Phase Space Hamiltonian with a Spin Coriolis Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform electronic structure calculations for a set of molecules with degenerate spin-dependent ground states ($^3$CH$_2$, $^2$CH$_3^{\bullet}$, $^3$O$_2$) going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and accounting for nuclear motion. According to a phase space (PS) approach that parametrizes electronic states ($|\Phi\rangle$) and electronic energies ($E$) by nuclear position and momentum (i.e., $|\Phi(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{P}) \rangle$ and $E(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{P})$), we find that the presence of degenerate spin degrees of freedom leads to broken symmetry ground states. More precisely, rather than a single degenerate minimum at $(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{P}) = (\mathbf{R}_{min}, 0)$, the ground state energy has two minima at $(\mathbf{R},\mathbf{P}) = (\mathbf{R}_{min}',\pm \mathbf{P}_{min})$ (where $\mathbf{R}_{min}'$ is close to $\mathbf{R}_{min}$), dramatically contradicting the notion that the total energy of the system can be written in separable form as $E = \frac{\mathbf{P}^2}{2M} + V_{el}$. Although we find that the broken symmetry solutions have small barriers between them for the small molecules, we hypothesize that the barriers should be macroscopically large for metallic solids, thus offering up a new phase-space potential energy surface for simulating the Einstein-de Haas effect.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale and Element-Specific Lattice Temperature Measurements using Core-Loss Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring nanoscale local temperatures, particularly in vertically integrated and multi-component systems, remains challenging. Spectroscopic techniques like X-ray absorption and core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are sensitive to lattice temperature, but understanding thermal effects is nontrivial. This work explores the potential for nanoscale and element-specific core-loss thermometry by comparing the Si L2,3 edge's temperature-dependent redshift against plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) in a scanning TEM. Using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we ab initio model both the Si L2,3 and plasmon redshift. We find that the core-loss redshift occurs due to bandgap reduction from electron-phonon renormalization. Our results indicate that despite lower core-loss signal intensity compared to plasmon features, core-loss thermometry has key advantages and can be more accurate through standard spectral denoising. Specifically, we show that the Varshni equation easily interprets the core-loss redshift for semiconductors, which avoids plasmon spectral convolution for PEET in complex junctions and interfaces. We also find that core-loss thermometry is more accurate than PEET at modeling thermal lattice expansion in semiconductors, unless the specimen's temperature-dependent dielectric properties are fully characterized. Furthermore, core-loss thermometry has the potential to measure nanoscale heating in multi-component materials and stacked interfaces with elemental specificity at length scales smaller than the plasmon's wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Molecular Dynamics and TEM Analysis of Crystal Growth and Hydrogen Sensing in Pt-Functionalized Graphene Chemiresistive Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene functionalized with catalytic transition metals offers high-performance gas sensing by coupling graphene's exceptional electronic transport properties with the metal's catalytic activity, yet the atomistic relationships connecting synthesis parameters, morphological outcomes, and sensor performance remain elusive. We developed an equivariant machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) with near-DFT accuracy to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Pt crystal growth on graphene and subsequent H$_2$-sensing. MD simulations validated by TEM show that Pt deposition begins with dispersed nuclei coalescing into polycrystalline nanoclusters with predominantly FCC interiors, while both MD and Raman spectroscopy reveal a predominantly non-covalent Pt-graphene interaction that induces moderate local strain and charge transfer yet preserves graphene's structural integrity. Reactive MD simulations confirm H$_2$ dissociative chemisorption exclusively on Pt, with negligible spillover onto pristine graphene. However, H adsorption on Pt attenuates the Pt-graphene interfacial binding, providing an indirect electronic pathway for H$_2$ sensing. Transient and steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrate that an intermediate Pt loading minimizes the limit of detection; lower loadings facilitate faster response and recovery kinetics and enhance signal transduction, whereas higher loadings increase the doping level of graphene. DFT charge analysis indicates that under-coordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, whereas continuous Pt films induce $p$-type doping, with both effects attenuated upon H adsorption. The developed machine-learned MD framework enables quantum-mechanically accurate modeling of metal crystal growth on graphene, elucidates the underlying H$_2$-sensing mechanism, and correlates several key sensing figures of merit with metal loading and morphology.</description>
