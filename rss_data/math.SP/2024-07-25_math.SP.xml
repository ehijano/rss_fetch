      <title>A new approach to inverse Sturm-Liouville problems based on point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, motivated by point interaction, we propose a new and explicit approach to inverse Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems under Dirichlet boundary. More precisely, when a given Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with the unknown integrable potential interacts with $\delta$-function potentials, we obtain a family of perturbation problems, called point interaction models in quantum mechanics. Then, only depending on the first eigenvalues of these perturbed problems, we define and study the first eigenvalue function, by which the desired potential can be expressed explicitly and uniquely. As by-products, using the analytic function theoretic tools, we also generalize several fundamental theorems of classical Sturm-Liouville problems to measure differential equations.</description>

      <title>Benjamini-Schramm and spectral convergence II. The non-homogeneous case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equivalence of spectral convergence and Benjamini-Schramm convergence is extended from homogeneous spaces to spaces which are compact modulo isometry group. The equivalence is proven under the condition of a uniform discreteness property. It is open, which implications hold without this condition.</description>

      <title>Fourier Decay from $L^2$-Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach for establishing rates of decay for the Fourier transform of a wide class of dynamically defined measures. Among the key features of the method is the systematic use of the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in~\cite{Khalil-Mixing}, coupled with non-concentration estimates for the derivatives of the underlying dynamical system. This method yields polylogarithmic Fourier decay for Diophantine self-similar measures, and polynomial decay for Patterson-Sullivan measures of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, Gibbs measures associated to non-integrable $C^2$ conformal systems, as well as stationary measures for carpet-like non-conformal iterated function systems. Applications include essential spectral gaps on convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, fractal uncertainty principles, and equidistribution properties of typical vectors in fractal sets.</description>

      <title>Calder\'{o}n problem for fractional Schr\"{o}dinger operators on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an analog of the anisotropic Calder\'on problem for fractional Schr\"odinger operators $(-\Delta_g)^\alpha + V$ with $\alpha \in (0,1)$ on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimensions two and higher. We prove that the knowledge of a Cauchy data set of solutions of the fractional Schr\"odinger equation, given on an open nonempty a priori known subset of the manifold determines both the Riemannian manifold up to an isometry and the potential up to the corresponding gauge transformation, under certain geometric assumptions on the manifold as well as the observation set. Our method of proof is based on: (i) studying a new variant of the Gel'fand inverse spectral problem without the normalization assumption on the energy of eigenfunctions, and (ii) the discovery of an entanglement principle for nonlocal equations involving two or more compactly supported functions. Our solution to (i) makes connections to antipodal sets as well as local control for eigenfunctions and quantum chaos, while (ii) requires sharp interpolation results for holomorphic functions. We believe that both of these results can find applications in other areas of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Morse Functions, Excision and Higher Torsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing invariants from both topological and geometric perspectives is a key focus in index theorem. This paper compares higher analytic and topological torsions and establishes a version of the higher Cheeger-M\"uller/Bismut-Zhang theorem. In fact, Bismut-Goette achieved this comparison assuming the existence of fiberwise Morse functions satisfying the fiberwise Thom-Smale transversality condition (TS condition). To fully generalize the theorem, we should remove this assumption. Notably, unlike fiberwise Morse functions, fiberwise generalized Morse functions (GMFs) always exist, we extend Bismut-Goette's setup by considering a fibration $ M \to S $ with a unitarily flat complex bundle $ F \to M $ and a fiberwise GMF $ f $, while retaining the TS condition.
  Compared to Bismut-Goette's work, handling birth-death points for a generalized Morse function poses a key difficulty. To address this, first, by the work of the author M.P., joint with Zhang and Zhu, we focus on a relative version of the theorem. Here, analytic and topological torsions are normalized by subtracting their corresponding torsions for trivial bundles. Next, using new techniques from by the author J.Y., we excise a small neighborhood around the locus where $f$ has birth-death points. This reduces the problem to Bismut-Goette's settings (or its version with boundaries) via a Witten-type deformation. However, new difficulties arise from very singular critical points during this deformation.To address these, we extend methods from Bismut-Lebeau, using Agmon estimates for noncompact manifolds developed by Dai and J.Y.</description>
