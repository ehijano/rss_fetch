      <title>The Subtle Interplay between Square-root Impact, Order Imbalance &amp; Volatility: A Unifying Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to reconcile several apparently contradictory observations in market microstructure: is the famous ''square-root law'' of metaorder impact that decays with time compatible with the random-walk nature of prices and the linear impact of order imbalances? Can one entirely explain the volatility of prices as resulting from the flow of uninformed metaorders that mechanically impact prices? We introduce a new theoretical framework to describe metaorders with different signs, sizes and durations, which all impact prices as a square-root of volume but with a subsequent time decay. We show that, as in the original propagator model, price diffusion is ensured by the long memory of cross-correlations between metaorders. In order to account for the effect of strongly fluctuating volumes $q$ of individual trades, we further introduce two $q$-dependent exponents, which allows us to account for the way the moments of generalized volume imbalance and the correlation between price changes and generalized order flow imbalance scales with $T$. We predict in particular that the corresponding power-laws depend in a non-monotonic fashion on a parameter $a$ that allows one to put the same weight on all child orders or overweight large orders, a behaviour clearly borne out by empirical data. We also predict that the correlation between price changes and volume imbalances should display a maximum as a function of $a$, which again matches observations. Such noteworthy agreement between theory and data suggests that our framework correctly captures the basic mechanism at the heart of price formation, namely the average impact of metaorders. We argue that our results support the ''Order-Driven'' theory of excess volatility, and are at odds with the idea that a ''Fundamental'' component accounts for a large share of the volatility of financial markets.</description>

      <title>FinTSBridge: A New Evaluation Suite for Real-world Financial Prediction with Advanced Time Series Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing attention to time series forecasting in recent years, many studies have proposed various solutions to address the challenges encountered in time series prediction, aiming to improve forecasting performance. However, effectively applying these time series forecasting models to the field of financial asset pricing remains a challenging issue. There is still a need for a bridge to connect cutting-edge time series forecasting models with financial asset pricing. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain; 2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and validated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new metrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series correlation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for these three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application potential of these forecasting models in important financial problems. We hope the developed new evaluation suite, FinTSBridge, can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of advanced forecasting models in finanical domains.</description>
