      <title>Relative asymptotics of multiple orthogonal polynomials for Nikishin systems of two measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relative asymptotics of two sequences of multiple orthogonal polynomials corresponding to two Nikishin systems of measures on the real line, the second one of which is obtained from the first one perturbing the generating measures with non-negative integrable functions. Each Nikishin system consists of two measures.</description>

      <title>Resonance and Periodic Solutions for Harmonic Oscillators with General Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the notion of resonance, as well as the existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions for a forced simple harmonic oscillator. While this topic is elementary, and well-studied for sinusoidal forcing, this does not seem to be the case when the forcing function is general (perhaps discontinuous). Clear statements of theorems and proofs do not readily appear in standard textbooks or online. For that reason, we provide a characterization of resonant solutions, written in terms of the relationship between the forcing and natural frequencies, as well as a condition on a particular Fourier mode. While our discussions involve some notions from $L^2$-spaces, our proofs are elementary, using this the variation of parameters formula; the main theorem and its proof should be readable by students who have completed a differential equations course and have some experience with analysis. We provide several examples, and give various constructions of resonant solutions. Additionally, we connect our discussion to notions of resonance in systems of partial differential equations, including fluid-structure interactions and partially damped systems.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of the DAHA of type $\check{C_1}C_1$ and their action on Askey-Wilson polynomials and functions. I. The flip $(a,b,c,d)\mapsto(a,b,qd^{-1},qc^{-1})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the automorphisms of the double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) of type $\check{C_1}C_1$ which have a relatively simple action on the generators and on the parameters, notably a symmetry $t_4$ which sends the Askey-Wilson parameters $(a,b,c,d)$ to $(a,b,qd^{-1},qc^{-1})$. We study how these symmetries act on the basic representation and on the symmetric and non-symmetric Askey-Wilson (AW) polynomials and functions. Interestingly $t_4$ maps AW polynomials to functions. In the second part of the paper we look for a version of non-symmetric AW functions that behave well under these symmetries.</description>

      <title>Fourier Decay from $L^2$-Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach for establishing rates of decay for the Fourier transform of a wide class of dynamically defined measures. Among the key features of the method is the systematic use of the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in~\cite{Khalil-Mixing}, coupled with non-concentration estimates for the derivatives of the underlying dynamical system. This method yields polylogarithmic Fourier decay for Diophantine self-similar measures, and polynomial decay for Patterson-Sullivan measures of convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, Gibbs measures associated to non-integrable $C^2$ conformal systems, as well as stationary measures for carpet-like non-conformal iterated function systems. Applications include essential spectral gaps on convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds, fractal uncertainty principles, and equidistribution properties of typical vectors in fractal sets.</description>

      <title>Vector valued estimates for matrix weighted maximal operators and product $\mathrm{BMO}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider maximal operators acting on vector valued functions, that is functions taking values on $\mathbb{C}^d,$ that incorporate matrix weights in their definitions. We show vector valued estimates, in the sense of Fefferman-Stein inequalities, for such operators. These are proven using an extrapolation result for convex body valued functions due to Bownik and Cruz-Uribe. Finally, we show an $\mathrm{H}^1$-$\mathrm{BMO}$ duality for matrix valued functions and we apply the previous vector valued estimates to show upper bounds for biparameter paraproducts.</description>

      <title>Decoupling for Schatten class operators in the setting of Quantum Harmonic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of decoupling for operators, and prove an equivalence between classical $\ell^qL^p$ decoupling for functions and $\ell^q\mathcal{S}^p$ decoupling for operators on bounded sets in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$. We also show that the equivalence only depends on the bounded set $\Omega$, and not the values of $p,q$ nor the partition of $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Poisson point processes and of optimal transport regularization with application in variational analysis of PET reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poisson distributed measurements in inverse problems often stem from Poisson point processes that are observed through discretized or finite-resolution detectors, one of the most prominent examples being positron emission tomography (PET). These inverse problems are typically reconstructed via Bayesian methods. A natural question then is whether and how the reconstruction converges as the signal-to-noise ratio tends to infinity and how this convergence interacts with other parameters such as the detector size. In this article we carry out a corresponding variational analysis for the exemplary Bayesian reconstruction functional from [arXiv:2311.17784,arXiv:1902.07521], which considers dynamic PET imaging (i.e.\ the object to be reconstructed changes over time) and uses an optimal transport regularization.</description>

      <title>A new approach to inverse Sturm-Liouville problems based on point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, motivated by point interaction, we propose a new and explicit approach to inverse Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems under Dirichlet boundary. More precisely, when a given Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with the unknown integrable potential interacts with $\delta$-function potentials, we obtain a family of perturbation problems, called point interaction models in quantum mechanics. Then, only depending on the first eigenvalues of these perturbed problems, we define and study the first eigenvalue function, by which the desired potential can be expressed explicitly and uniquely. As by-products, using the analytic function theoretic tools, we also generalize several fundamental theorems of classical Sturm-Liouville problems to measure differential equations.</description>

      <title>Matrix-weighted little BMO spaces in two parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we set up a theory of two-matrix weighted little BMO in two parameters. We prove that being a member of this class is equivalent to belonging uniformly in each variable to two-matrix weighted (one-parameter) BMO, a class studied extensively by J. Isralowitz, S. Pott, S. Treil and others. Using this equivalence, we deduce lower and upper bounds in terms of the two-matrix weighted little BMO norm of the symbol for the norm of commutators with Journ\'e operators.</description>

      <title>Classical discrete operators on variable $\ell^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{Z})$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show, by applying discrete weighted norm inequalities and the Rubio de Francia algorithm, that the discrete Hilbert transform and discrete Riesz potential are bounded on variable $\ell^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{Z})$ spaces whenever the discrete Hardy-Littlewood maximal is bounded on $\ell^{p'(\cdot)}(\mathbb{Z})$. We also obtain vector-valued inequalities for the discrete fractional maximal operator.</description>
