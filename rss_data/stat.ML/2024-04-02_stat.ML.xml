      <title>Verifying the Selected Completely at Random Assumption in Positive-Unlabeled Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is to train a binary classifier on the basis of training data containing positive and unlabeled instances, where unlabeled observations can belong either to the positive class or to the negative class. Modeling PU data requires certain assumptions on the labeling mechanism that describes which positive observations are assigned a label. The simplest assumption, considered in early works, is SCAR (Selected Completely at Random Assumption), according to which the propensity score function, defined as the probability of assigning a label to a positive observation, is constant. On the other hand, a much more realistic assumption is SAR (Selected at Random), which states that the propensity function solely depends on the observed feature vector. SCAR-based algorithms are much simpler and computationally much faster compared to SAR-based algorithms, which usually require challenging estimation of the propensity score. In this work, we propose a relatively simple and computationally fast test that can be used to determine whether the observed data meet the SCAR assumption. Our test is based on generating artificial labels conforming to the SCAR case, which in turn allows to mimic the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis of SCAR. We justify our method theoretically. In experiments, we demonstrate that the test successfully detects various deviations from SCAR scenario and at the same time it is possible to effectively control the type I error. The proposed test can be recommended as a pre-processing step to decide which final PU algorithm to choose in cases when nature of labeling mechanism is not known.</description>

      <title>Functional-Edged Network Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrasts with existing works which all consider nodes as functions and use edges to represent the relationships between different functions. We target at network modeling whose edges are functional data and transform the adjacency matrix into a functional adjacency tensor, introducing an additional dimension dedicated to function representation. Tucker functional decomposition is used for the functional adjacency tensor, and to further consider the community between nodes, we regularize the basis matrices to be symmetrical. Furthermore, to deal with irregular observations of the functional edges, we conduct model inference to solve a tensor completion problem. It is optimized by a Riemann conjugate gradient descent method. Besides these, we also derive several theorems to show the desirable properties of the functional edged network model. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of our proposed model using simulation data and real metro system data from Hong Kong and Singapore.</description>

      <title>Partially-Observable Sequential Change-Point Detection for Autocorrelated Data via Upper Confidence Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential change point detection for multivariate autocorrelated data is a very common problem in practice. However, when the sensing resources are limited, only a subset of variables from the multivariate system can be observed at each sensing time point. This raises the problem of partially observable multi-sensor sequential change point detection. For it, we propose a detection scheme called adaptive upper confidence region with state space model (AUCRSS). It models multivariate time series via a state space model (SSM), and uses an adaptive sampling policy for efficient change point detection and localization. A partially-observable Kalman filter algorithm is developed for online inference of SSM, and accordingly, a change point detection scheme based on a generalized likelihood ratio test is developed. How its detection power relates to the adaptive sampling strategy is analyzed. Meanwhile, by treating the detection power as a reward, its connection with the online combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem is formulated and an adaptive upper confidence region algorithm is proposed for adaptive sampling policy design. Theoretical analysis of the asymptotic average detection delay is performed, and thorough numerical studies with synthetic data and real-world data are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Bayesian Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian filtering serves as the mainstream framework of state estimation in dynamic systems. Its standard version utilizes total probability rule and Bayes' law alternatively, where how to define and compute conditional probability is critical to state distribution inference. Previously, the conditional probability is assumed to be exactly known, which represents a measure of the occurrence probability of one event, given the second event. In this paper, we find that by adding an additional event that stipulates an inequality condition, we can transform the conditional probability into a special integration that is analogous to convolution. Based on this transformation, we show that both transition probability and output probability can be generalized to convolutional forms, resulting in a more general filtering framework that we call convolutional Bayesian filtering. This new framework encompasses standard Bayesian filtering as a special case when the distance metric of the inequality condition is selected as Dirac delta function. It also allows for a more nuanced consideration of model mismatch by choosing different types of inequality conditions. For instance, when the distance metric is defined in a distributional sense, the transition probability and output probability can be approximated by simply rescaling them into fractional powers. Under this framework, a robust version of Kalman filter can be constructed by only altering the noise covariance matrix, while maintaining the conjugate nature of Gaussian distributions. Finally, we exemplify the effectiveness of our approach by reshaping classic filtering algorithms into convolutional versions, including Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter and particle filter.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Continuous Normalizing Flows for Learning Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are a generative method for learning probability distributions, which is based on ordinary differential equations. This method has shown remarkable empirical success across various applications, including large-scale image synthesis, protein structure prediction, and molecule generation. In this work, we study the theoretical properties of CNFs with linear interpolation in learning probability distributions from a finite random sample, using a flow matching objective function. We establish non-asymptotic error bounds for the distribution estimator based on CNFs, in terms of the Wasserstein-2 distance. The key assumption in our analysis is that the target distribution satisfies one of the following three conditions: it either has a bounded support, is strongly log-concave, or is a finite or infinite mixture of Gaussian distributions. We present a convergence analysis framework that encompasses the error due to velocity estimation, the discretization error, and the early stopping error. A key step in our analysis involves establishing the regularity properties of the velocity field and its estimator for CNFs constructed with linear interpolation. This necessitates the development of uniform error bounds with Lipschitz regularity control of deep ReLU networks that approximate the Lipschitz function class, which could be of independent interest. Our nonparametric convergence analysis offers theoretical guarantees for using CNFs to learn probability distributions from a finite random sample.</description>

      <title>C-XGBoost: A tree boosting model for causal effect estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal effect estimation aims at estimating the Average Treatment Effect as well as the Conditional Average Treatment Effect of a treatment to an outcome from the available data. This knowledge is important in many safety-critical domains, where it often needs to be extracted from observational data. In this work, we propose a new causal inference model, named C-XGBoost, for the prediction of potential outcomes. The motivation of our approach is to exploit the superiority of tree-based models for handling tabular data together with the notable property of causal inference neural network-based models to learn representations that are useful for estimating the outcome for both the treatment and non-treatment cases. The proposed model also inherits the considerable advantages of XGBoost model such as efficiently handling features with missing values requiring minimum preprocessing effort, as well as it is equipped with regularization techniques to avoid overfitting/bias. Furthermore, we propose a new loss function for efficiently training the proposed causal inference model. The experimental analysis, which is based on the performance profiles of Dolan and Mor{\'e} as well as on post-hoc and non-parametric statistical tests, provide strong evidence about the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>TransFusion: Covariate-Shift Robust Transfer Learning for High-Dimensional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenge that sets transfer learning apart from traditional supervised learning is the distribution shift, reflected as the shift between the source and target models and that between the marginal covariate distributions. In this work, we tackle model shifts in the presence of covariate shifts in the high-dimensional regression setting. Specifically, we propose a two-step method with a novel fused-regularizer that effectively leverages samples from source tasks to improve the learning performance on a target task with limited samples. Nonasymptotic bound is provided for the estimation error of the target model, showing the robustness of the proposed method to covariate shifts. We further establish conditions under which the estimator is minimax-optimal. Additionally, we extend the method to a distributed setting, allowing for a pretraining-finetuning strategy, requiring just one round of communication while retaining the estimation rate of the centralized version. Numerical tests validate our theory, highlighting the method's robustness to covariate shifts.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Non-convex Stochastic Constrained Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) is a powerful framework for training robust models against data distribution shifts. This paper focuses on constrained DRO, which has an explicit characterization of the robustness level. Existing studies on constrained DRO mostly focus on convex loss function, and exclude the practical and challenging case with non-convex loss function, e.g., neural network. This paper develops a stochastic algorithm and its performance analysis for non-convex constrained DRO. The computational complexity of our stochastic algorithm at each iteration is independent of the overall dataset size, and thus is suitable for large-scale applications. We focus on the general Cressie-Read family divergence defined uncertainty set which includes $\chi^2$-divergences as a special case. We prove that our algorithm finds an $\epsilon$-stationary point with a computational complexity of $\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-3k_*-5})$, where $k_*$ is the parameter of the Cressie-Read divergence. The numerical results indicate that our method outperforms existing methods.} Our method also applies to the smoothed conditional value at risk (CVaR) DRO.</description>

      <title>Empowering Credit Scoring Systems with Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Quantum Kernels are projected to provide early-stage usefulness for quantum machine learning. However, highly sophisticated classical models are hard to surpass without losing interpretability, particularly when vast datasets can be exploited. Nonetheless, classical models struggle once data is scarce and skewed. Quantum feature spaces are projected to find better links between data features and the target class to be predicted even in such challenging scenarios and most importantly, enhanced generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Systemic Quantum Score (SQS) and provide preliminary results indicating potential advantage over purely classical models in a production grade use case for the Finance sector. SQS shows in our specific study an increased capacity to extract patterns out of fewer data points as well as improved performance over data-hungry algorithms such as XGBoost, providing advantage in a competitive market as it is the FinTech and Neobank regime.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimization with Constraints: A Non-asymptotic Instance-Dependent Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of stochastic convex optimization under convex constraints. We analyze the behavior of a natural variance reduced proximal gradient (VRPG) algorithm for this problem. Our main result is a non-asymptotic guarantee for VRPG algorithm. Contrary to minimax worst case guarantees, our result is instance-dependent in nature. This means that our guarantee captures the complexity of the loss function, the variability of the noise, and the geometry of the constraint set. We show that the non-asymptotic performance of the VRPG algorithm is governed by the scaled distance (scaled by $\sqrt{N}$) between the solutions of the given problem and that of a certain small perturbation of the given problem -- both solved under the given convex constraints; here, $N$ denotes the number of samples. Leveraging a well-established connection between local minimax lower bounds and solutions to perturbed problems, we show that as $N \rightarrow \infty$, the VRPG algorithm achieves the renowned local minimax lower bound by H\`{a}jek and Le Cam up to universal constants and a logarithmic factor of the sample size.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Sharp Off-Policy Evaluation in Robust Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study evaluating a policy under best- and worst-case perturbations to a Markov decision process (MDP), given transition observations from the original MDP, whether under the same or different policy. This is an important problem when there is the possibility of a shift between historical and future environments, due to e.g. unmeasured confounding, distributional shift, or an adversarial environment. We propose a perturbation model that can modify transition kernel densities up to a given multiplicative factor or its reciprocal, which extends the classic marginal sensitivity model (MSM) for single time step decision making to infinite-horizon RL. We characterize the sharp bounds on policy value under this model, that is, the tightest possible bounds given by the transition observations from the original MDP, and we study the estimation of these bounds from such transition observations. We develop an estimator with several appealing guarantees: it is semiparametrically efficient, and remains so even when certain necessary nuisance functions such as worst-case Q-functions are estimated at slow nonparametric rates. It is also asymptotically normal, enabling easy statistical inference using Wald confidence intervals. In addition, when certain nuisances are estimated inconsistently we still estimate a valid, albeit possibly not sharp bounds on the policy value. We validate these properties in numeric simulations. The combination of accounting for environment shifts from train to test (robustness), being insensitive to nuisance-function estimation (orthogonality), and accounting for having only finite samples to learn from (inference) together leads to credible and reliable policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Robust Learning for Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Observational Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many public policies and medical interventions involve dynamics in their treatment assignments, where treatments are sequentially assigned to the same individuals across multiple stages, and the effect of treatment at each stage is usually heterogeneous with respect to the history of prior treatments and associated characteristics. We study statistical learning of optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) that guide the optimal treatment assignment for each individual at each stage based on the individual's history. We propose a step-wise doubly-robust approach to learn the optimal DTR using observational data under the assumption of sequential ignorability. The approach solves the sequential treatment assignment problem through backward induction, where, at each step, we combine estimators of propensity scores and action-value functions (Q-functions) to construct augmented inverse probability weighting estimators of values of policies for each stage. The approach consistently estimates the optimal DTR if either a propensity score or Q-function for each stage is consistently estimated. Furthermore, the resulting DTR can achieve the optimal convergence rate $n^{-1/2}$ of regret under mild conditions on the convergence rate for estimators of the nuisance parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lion optimizer has been a promising competitor with the AdamW for training large AI models, with advantages on memory, computation, and sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Distributed Lion, an innovative adaptation of Lion for distributed training environments. Leveraging the sign operator in Lion, our Distributed Lion only requires communicating binary or lower-precision vectors between workers to the center server, significantly reducing the communication cost. Our theoretical analysis confirms Distributed Lion's convergence properties. Empirical results demonstrate its robustness across a range of tasks, worker counts, and batch sizes, on both vision and language problems. Notably, Distributed Lion attains comparable performance to standard Lion or AdamW optimizers applied on aggregated gradients, but with significantly reduced communication bandwidth. This feature is particularly advantageous for training large models. In addition, we also demonstrate that Distributed Lion presents a more favorable performance-bandwidth balance compared to existing efficient distributed methods such as deep gradient compression and ternary gradients.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Calibration of Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) may lead their users to make suboptimal downstream decisions when they confidently hallucinate. This issue can be mitigated by having the LM verbally convey the probability that its claims are correct, but existing models cannot produce text with calibrated confidence statements. Through the lens of decision-making, we formalize linguistic calibration for long-form generations: an LM is linguistically calibrated if its generations enable its users to make calibrated probabilistic predictions. This definition enables a training framework where a supervised finetuning step bootstraps an LM to emit long-form generations with confidence statements such as "I estimate a 30% chance of..." or "I am certain that...", followed by a reinforcement learning step which rewards generations that enable a user to provide calibrated answers to related questions. We linguistically calibrate Llama 2 7B and find in automated and human evaluations of long-form generations that it is significantly more calibrated than strong finetuned factuality baselines with comparable accuracy. These findings generalize under distribution shift on question-answering and under a significant task shift to person biography generation. Our results demonstrate that long-form generations may be calibrated end-to-end by constructing an objective in the space of the predictions that users make in downstream decision-making.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning with Reconstruction Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most applications of utilizing neural networks for mathematical optimization, a dedicated model is trained for each specific optimization objective. However, in many scenarios, several distinct yet correlated objectives or tasks often need to be optimized on the same set of problem inputs. Instead of independently training a different neural network for each problem separately, it would be more efficient to exploit the correlations between these objectives and to train multiple neural network models with shared model parameters and feature representations. To achieve this, this paper first establishes the concept of common information: the shared knowledge required for solving the correlated tasks, then proposes a novel approach for model training by adding into the model an additional reconstruction stage associated with a new reconstruction loss. This loss is for reconstructing the common information starting from a selected hidden layer in the model. The proposed approach encourages the learned features to be general and transferable, and therefore can be readily used for efficient transfer learning. For numerical simulations, three applications are studied: transfer learning on classifying MNIST handwritten digits, the device-to-device wireless network power allocation, and the multiple-input-single-output network downlink beamforming and localization. Simulation results suggest that the proposed approach is highly efficient in data and model complexity, is resilient to over-fitting, and has competitive performances.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Norm Interpolation Under Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is a critical part of real-world machine learning deployments and has been extensively studied in experimental works with overparameterized neural networks. However, even in the simplest setting of linear regression a notable gap still exists in the theoretical understanding of transfer learning. In-distribution research on high-dimensional linear regression has led to the identification of a phenomenon known as \textit{benign overfitting}, in which linear interpolators overfit to noisy training labels and yet still generalize well. This behavior occurs under specific conditions on the source covariance matrix and input data dimension. Therefore, it is natural to wonder how such high-dimensional linear models behave under transfer learning. We prove the first non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for benignly-overfit linear interpolators in the transfer learning setting. From our analysis, we propose a taxonomy of \textit{beneficial} and \textit{malignant} covariate shifts based on the degree of overparameterization. We follow our analysis with empirical studies that show these beneficial and malignant covariate shifts for linear interpolators on real image data, and for fully-connected neural networks in settings where the input data dimension is larger than the training sample size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of meta-learning several contextual stochastic bandits tasks by leveraging their concentration around a low-dimensional affine subspace, which we learn via online principal component analysis to reduce the expected regret over the encountered bandits. We propose and theoretically analyze two strategies that solve the problem: One based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty and the other via Thompson sampling. Our framework is generic and includes previously proposed approaches as special cases. Besides, the empirical results show that our methods significantly reduce the regret on several bandit tasks.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Nuisance Function Estimation for Causal Mediation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When estimating the direct and indirect causal effects using the influence function-based estimator of the mediation functional, it is crucial to understand what aspects of the treatment, the mediator, and the outcome mean mechanisms should be focused on. Specifically, considering them as nuisance functions and attempting to fit these nuisance functions as accurate as possible is not necessarily the best approach to take. In this work, we propose a two-stage estimation strategy for the nuisance functions that estimates the nuisance functions based on the role they play in the structure of the bias of the influence function-based estimator of the mediation functional. We provide robustness analysis of the proposed method, as well as sufficient conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parameter of interest.</description>

      <title>Adversarially-Robust Inference on Trees via Belief Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of posterior inference on tree-structured graphical models in the presence of a malicious adversary who can corrupt some observed nodes. In the well-studied broadcasting on trees model, corresponding to the ferromagnetic Ising model on a $d$-regular tree with zero external field, when a natural signal-to-noise ratio exceeds one (the celebrated Kesten-Stigum threshold), the posterior distribution of the root given the leaves is bounded away from $\mathrm{Ber}(1/2)$, and carries nontrivial information about the sign of the root. This posterior distribution can be computed exactly via dynamic programming, also known as belief propagation.
  We first confirm a folklore belief that a malicious adversary who can corrupt an inverse-polynomial fraction of the leaves of their choosing makes this inference impossible. Our main result is that accurate posterior inference about the root vertex given the leaves is possible when the adversary is constrained to make corruptions at a $\rho$-fraction of randomly-chosen leaf vertices, so long as the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds $O(\log d)$ and $\rho \leq c \varepsilon$ for some universal $c &gt; 0$. Since inference becomes information-theoretically impossible when $\rho \gg \varepsilon$, this amounts to an information-theoretically optimal fraction of corruptions, up to a constant multiplicative factor. Furthermore, we show that the canonical belief propagation algorithm performs this inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PyTorch Frame, a PyTorch-based framework for deep learning over multi-modal tabular data. PyTorch Frame makes tabular deep learning easy by providing a PyTorch-based data structure to handle complex tabular data, introducing a model abstraction to enable modular implementation of tabular models, and allowing external foundation models to be incorporated to handle complex columns (e.g., LLMs for text columns). We demonstrate the usefulness of PyTorch Frame by implementing diverse tabular models in a modular way, successfully applying these models to complex multi-modal tabular data, and integrating our framework with PyTorch Geometric, a PyTorch library for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), to perform end-to-end learning over relational databases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model-selection method for dynamic real-life networks. Our approach involves training a classifier on a large body of synthetic network data. The data is generated by simulating nine state-of-the-art random graph models for dynamic networks, with parameter range chosen to ensure exponential growth of the network size in time. We design a conceptually novel type of dynamic features that count new links received by a group of vertices in a particular time interval. The proposed features are easy to compute, analytically tractable, and interpretable. Our approach achieves a near-perfect classification of synthetic networks, exceeding the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Applying our classification method to real-world citation networks gives credibility to the claims in the literature that models with preferential attachment, fitness and aging fit real-world citation networks best, although sometimes, the predicted model does not involve vertex fitness.</description>

      <title>Inference in Randomized Least Squares and PCA via Normality of Quadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms can be used to speed up the analysis of large datasets. In this paper, we develop a unified methodology for statistical inference via randomized sketching or projections in two of the most fundamental problems in multivariate statistical analysis: least squares and PCA. The methodology applies to fixed datasets -- i.e., is data-conditional -- and the only randomness is due to the randomized algorithm. We propose statistical inference methods for a broad range of sketching distributions, such as the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform (SRHT), Sparse Sign Embeddings (SSE) and CountSketch, sketching matrices with i.i.d. entries, and uniform subsampling. To our knowledge, no comparable methods are available for SSE and for SRHT in PCA. Our novel theoretical approach rests on showing the asymptotic normality of certain quadratic forms. As a contribution of broader interest, we show central limit theorems for quadratic forms of the SRHT, relying on a novel proof via a dyadic expansion that leverages the recursive structure of the Hadamard transform. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and empirical datasets support the efficacy of our methods, and in particular suggest that sketching methods can have better computation-estimation tradeoffs than recently proposed optimal subsampling methods.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Frequency Domain Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-parametric frequency-domain system identification from a finite-sample perspective. We assume an open loop scenario where the excitation input is periodic and consider the Empirical Transfer Function Estimate (ETFE), where the goal is to estimate the frequency response at certain desired (evenly-spaced) frequencies, given input-output samples. We show that under sub-Gaussian colored noise (in time-domain) and stability assumptions, the ETFE estimates are concentrated around the true values. The error rate is of the order of $\mathcal{O}((d_{\mathrm{u}}+\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{u}}d_{\mathrm{y}}})\sqrt{M/N_{\mathrm{tot}}})$, where $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total number of samples, $M$ is the number of desired frequencies, and $d_{\mathrm{u}},\,d_{\mathrm{y}}$ are the dimensions of the input and output signals respectively. This rate remains valid for general irrational transfer functions and does not require a finite order state-space representation. By tuning $M$, we obtain a $N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/3}$ finite-sample rate for learning the frequency response over all frequencies in the $ \mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm. Our result draws upon an extension of the Hanson-Wright inequality to semi-infinite matrices. We study the finite-sample behavior of ETFE in simulations.</description>

      <title>The Rate-Distortion-Perception Trade-off: The Role of Private Randomness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In image compression, with recent advances in generative modeling, the existence of a trade-off between the rate and the perceptual quality (realism) has been brought to light, where the realism is measured by the closeness of the output distribution to the source. It has been shown that randomized codes can be strictly better under a number of formulations. In particular, the role of common randomness has been well studied. We elucidate the role of private randomness in the compression of a memoryless source $X^n=(X_1,...,X_n)$ under two kinds of realism constraints. The near-perfect realism constraint requires the joint distribution of output symbols $(Y_1,...,Y_n)$ to be arbitrarily close the distribution of the source in total variation distance (TVD). The per-symbol near-perfect realism constraint requires that the TVD between the distribution of output symbol $Y_t$ and the source distribution be arbitrarily small, uniformly in the index $t.$ We characterize the corresponding asymptotic rate-distortion trade-off and show that encoder private randomness is not useful if the compression rate is lower than the entropy of the source, however limited the resources in terms of common randomness and decoder private randomness may be.</description>

Abstract: Linear models are ubiquitous in data science, but are particularly prone to overfitting and data memorization in high dimensions. To guarantee the privacy of training data, differential privacy can be used. Many papers have proposed optimization techniques for high-dimensional differentially private linear models, but a systematic comparison between these methods does not exist. We close this gap by providing a comprehensive review of optimization methods for private high-dimensional linear models. Empirical tests on all methods demonstrate robust and coordinate-optimized algorithms perform best, which can inform future research. Code for implementing all methods is released online.</description>

Abstract: We give nearly-tight upper and lower bounds for the improving multi-armed bandits problem. An instance of this problem has $k$ arms, each of whose reward function is a concave and increasing function of the number of times that arm has been pulled so far. We show that for any randomized online algorithm, there exists an instance on which it must suffer at least an $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ approximation factor relative to the optimal reward. We then provide a randomized online algorithm that guarantees an $O(\sqrt{k})$ approximation factor, if it is told the maximum reward achievable by the optimal arm in advance. We then show how to remove this assumption at the cost of an extra $O(\log k)$ approximation factor, achieving an overall $O(\sqrt{k} \log k)$ approximation relative to optimal.</description>

Abstract: In real-world graph data, distribution shifts can manifest in various ways, such as the emergence of new categories and changes in the relative proportions of existing categories. It is often important to detect nodes of novel categories under such distribution shifts for safety or insight discovery purposes. We introduce a new approach, Recall-Constrained Optimization with Selective Link Prediction (RECO-SLIP), to detect nodes belonging to novel categories in attributed graphs under subpopulation shifts. By integrating a recall-constrained learning framework with a sample-efficient link prediction mechanism, RECO-SLIP addresses the dual challenges of resilience against subpopulation shifts and the effective exploitation of graph structure. Our extensive empirical evaluation across multiple graph datasets demonstrates the superior performance of RECO-SLIP over existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of optimal ridge regularization and optimal ridge risk for out-of-distribution prediction, where the test distribution deviates arbitrarily from the train distribution. We establish general conditions that determine the sign of the optimal regularization level under covariate and regression shifts. These conditions capture the alignment between the covariance and signal structures in the train and test data and reveal stark differences compared to the in-distribution setting. For example, a negative regularization level can be optimal under covariate shift or regression shift, even when the training features are isotropic or the design is underparameterized. Furthermore, we prove that the optimally-tuned risk is monotonic in the data aspect ratio, even in the out-of-distribution setting and when optimizing over negative regularization levels. In general, our results do not make any modeling assumptions for the train or the test distributions, except for moment bounds, and allow for arbitrary shifts and the widest possible range of (negative) regularization levels.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Framework of Watermarks for Large Language Models: Pivot, Detection Efficiency and Optimal Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, embedding (nearly) unnoticeable statistical signals into text generated by large language models (LLMs), also known as watermarking, has been used as a principled approach to provable detection of LLM-generated text from its human-written counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the statistical efficiency of watermarks and designing powerful detection rules. Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of watermark detection, our framework starts by selecting a pivotal statistic of the text and a secret key -- provided by the LLM to the verifier -- to enable controlling the false positive rate (the error of mistakenly detecting human-written text as LLM-generated). Next, this framework allows one to evaluate the power of watermark detection rules by obtaining a closed-form expression of the asymptotic false negative rate (the error of incorrectly classifying LLM-generated text as human-written). Our framework further reduces the problem of determining the optimal detection rule to solving a minimax optimization program. We apply this framework to two representative watermarks -- one of which has been internally implemented at OpenAI -- and obtain several findings that can be instrumental in guiding the practice of implementing watermarks. In particular, we derive optimal detection rules for these watermarks under our framework. These theoretically derived detection rules are demonstrated to be competitive and sometimes enjoy a higher power than existing detection approaches through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.00363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, various methods have been proposed for estimating prediction intervals in regression settings, including Bayesian methods, ensemble methods, direct interval estimation methods and conformal prediction methods. An important issue is the calibration of these methods: the generated prediction intervals should have a predefined coverage level, without being overly conservative. In this work, we review the above four classes of methods from a conceptual and experimental point of view. Results on benchmark data sets from various domains highlight large fluctuations in performance from one data set to another. These observations can be attributed to the violation of certain assumptions that are inherent to some classes of methods. We illustrate how conformal prediction can be used as a general calibration procedure for methods that deliver poor results without a calibration step.</description>

Abstract: Decision-makers often simultaneously face many related but heterogeneous learning problems. For instance, a large retailer may wish to learn product demand at different stores to solve pricing or inventory problems, making it desirable to learn jointly for stores serving similar customers; alternatively, a hospital network may wish to learn patient risk at different providers to allocate personalized interventions, making it desirable to learn jointly for hospitals serving similar patient populations. Motivated by real datasets, we study a natural setting where the unknown parameter in each learning instance can be decomposed into a shared global parameter plus a sparse instance-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage multitask learning estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way, using a unique combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and LASSO regression (to debias the results). Our estimator yields improved sample complexity bounds in the feature dimension d relative to commonly-employed estimators; this improvement is exponential for "data-poor" instances, which benefit the most from multitask learning. We illustrate the utility of these results for online learning by embedding our multitask estimator within simultaneous contextual bandit algorithms. We specify a dynamic calibration of our estimator to appropriately balance the bias-variance tradeoff over time, improving the resulting regret bounds in the context dimension d. Finally, we illustrate the value of our approach on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretically Optimal Sample Complexity of Learning Dynamical Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the optimal sample complexity of learning the underlying interactions or dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as dynamical DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary (WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static DAG setting, a metric and an algorithm based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct the DDAG. It is shown that the optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound, a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Gaussian Vector Fields on Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various applications ranging from robotics to climate science require modeling signals on non-Euclidean domains, such as the sphere. Gaussian process models on manifolds have recently been proposed for such tasks, in particular when uncertainty quantification is needed. In the manifold setting, vector-valued signals can behave very differently from scalar-valued ones, with much of the progress so far focused on modeling the latter. The former, however, are crucial for many applications, such as modeling wind speeds or force fields of unknown dynamical systems. In this paper, we propose novel Gaussian process models for vector-valued signals on manifolds that are intrinsically defined and account for the geometry of the space in consideration. We provide computational primitives needed to deploy the resulting Hodge-Mat\'ern Gaussian vector fields on the two-dimensional sphere and the hypertori. Further, we highlight two generalization directions: discrete two-dimensional meshes and "ideal" manifolds like hyperspheres, Lie groups, and homogeneous spaces. Finally, we show that our Gaussian vector fields constitute considerably more refined inductive biases than the extrinsic fields proposed before.</description>

      <title>Handling The Non-Smooth Challenge in Tensor SVD: A Multi-Objective Tensor Recovery Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, numerous tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD)-based tensor recovery methods have shown promise in processing visual data, such as color images and videos. However, these methods often suffer from severe performance degradation when confronted with tensor data exhibiting non-smooth changes. It has been commonly observed in real-world scenarios but ignored by the traditional t-SVD-based methods. In this work, we introduce a novel tensor recovery model with a learnable tensor nuclear norm to address such a challenge. We develop a new optimization algorithm named the Alternating Proximal Multiplier Method (APMM) to iteratively solve the proposed tensor completion model. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the convergence of the proposed APMM to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the optimization problem. In addition, we propose a multi-objective tensor recovery framework based on APMM to efficiently explore the correlations of tensor data across its various dimensions, providing a new perspective on extending the t-SVD-based method to higher-order tensor cases. Numerical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in tensor completion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Bayesian experimental design for non-exchangeable data that formulates it as risk-sensitive policy optimization. We develop the Inside-Out SMC\textsuperscript{2} algorithm, a nested sequential Monte Carlo technique to infer optimal designs, and embed it into a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo framework to perform gradient-based policy amortization. Our approach is distinct from other amortized experimental design techniques, as it does not rely on contrastive estimators. Numerical validation on a set of dynamical systems showcases the efficacy of our method in comparison to other state-of-the-art strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistics and machine learning, logistic regression is a widely-used supervised learning technique primarily employed for binary classification tasks. When the number of observations greatly exceeds the number of predictor variables, we present a simple, randomized sampling-based algorithm for logistic regression problem that guarantees high-quality approximations to both the estimated probabilities and the overall discrepancy of the model. Our analysis builds upon two simple structural conditions that boil down to randomized matrix multiplication, a fundamental and well-understood primitive of randomized numerical linear algebra. We analyze the properties of estimated probabilities of logistic regression when leverage scores are used to sample observations, and prove that accurate approximations can be achieved with a sample whose size is much smaller than the total number of observations. To further validate our theoretical findings, we conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations. Overall, our work sheds light on the potential of using randomized sampling approaches to efficiently approximate the estimated probabilities in logistic regression, offering a practical and computationally efficient solution for large-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Kernel Multigrid: Accelerate Back-fitting via Sparse Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Additive Gaussian Processes (GPs) are popular approaches for nonparametric feature selection. The common training method for these models is Bayesian Back-fitting. However, the convergence rate of Back-fitting in training additive GPs is still an open problem. By utilizing a technique called Kernel Packets (KP), we prove that the convergence rate of Back-fitting is no faster than $(1-\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{n}))^t$, where $n$ and $t$ denote the data size and the iteration number, respectively. Consequently, Back-fitting requires a minimum of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ iterations to achieve convergence. Based on KPs, we further propose an algorithm called Kernel Multigrid (KMG). This algorithm enhances Back-fitting by incorporating a sparse Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to process the residuals after each Back-fitting iteration. It is applicable to additive GPs with both structured and scattered data. Theoretically, we prove that KMG reduces the required iterations to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ while preserving the time and space complexities at $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ per iteration, respectively. Numerically, by employing a sparse GPR with merely 10 inducing points, KMG can produce accurate approximations of high-dimensional targets within 5 iterations.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Exploration in Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.05830v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) achieves tremendous successes in practice, it is significantly less understood in theory, especially compared with value-based RL. In particular, it remains elusive how to design a provably efficient policy optimization algorithm that incorporates exploration. To bridge such a gap, this paper proposes an Optimistic variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (OPPO), which follows an ``optimistic version'' of the policy gradient direction. This paper proves that, in the problem of episodic Markov decision process with linear function approximation, unknown transition, and adversarial reward with full-information feedback, OPPO achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^2 H^3 T} )$ regret. Here $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the episode horizon, and $T$ is the total number of steps. To the best of our knowledge, OPPO is the first provably efficient policy optimization algorithm that explores.</description>

      <title>Can Temporal-Difference and Q-Learning Learn Representation? A Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.04761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal-difference and Q-learning play a key role in deep reinforcement learning, where they are empowered by expressive nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. At the core of their empirical successes is the learned feature representation, which embeds rich observations, e.g., images and texts, into the latent space that encodes semantic structures. Meanwhile, the evolution of such a feature representation is crucial to the convergence of temporal-difference and Q-learning.
  In particular, temporal-difference learning converges when the function approximator is linear in a feature representation, which is fixed throughout learning, and possibly diverges otherwise. We aim to answer the following questions: When the function approximator is a neural network, how does the associated feature representation evolve? If it converges, does it converge to the optimal one?
  We prove that, utilizing an overparameterized two-layer neural network, temporal-difference and Q-learning globally minimize the mean-squared projected Bellman error at a sublinear rate. Moreover, the associated feature representation converges to the optimal one, generalizing the previous analysis of Cai et al. (2019) in the neural tangent kernel regime, where the associated feature representation stabilizes at the initial one. The key to our analysis is a mean-field perspective, which connects the evolution of a finite-dimensional parameter to its limiting counterpart over an infinite-dimensional Wasserstein space. Our analysis generalizes to soft Q-learning, which is further connected to policy gradient.</description>

      <title>Variational Transport: A Convergent Particle-BasedAlgorithm for Distributional Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.11554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimization problem of minimizing a functional defined over a family of probability distributions, where the objective functional is assumed to possess a variational form. Such a distributional optimization problem arises widely in machine learning and statistics, with Monte-Carlo sampling, variational inference, policy optimization, and generative adversarial network as examples. For this problem, we propose a novel particle-based algorithm, dubbed as variational transport, which approximately performs Wasserstein gradient descent over the manifold of probability distributions via iteratively pushing a set of particles. Specifically, we prove that moving along the geodesic in the direction of functional gradient with respect to the second-order Wasserstein distance is equivalent to applying a pushforward mapping to a probability distribution, which can be approximated accurately by pushing a set of particles. Specifically, in each iteration of variational transport, we first solve the variational problem associated with the objective functional using the particles, whose solution yields the Wasserstein gradient direction. Then we update the current distribution by pushing each particle along the direction specified by such a solution. By characterizing both the statistical error incurred in estimating the Wasserstein gradient and the progress of the optimization algorithm, we prove that when the objective function satisfies a functional version of the Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) (Polyak, 1963) and smoothness conditions, variational transport converges linearly to the global minimum of the objective functional up to a certain statistical error, which decays to zero sublinearly as the number of particles goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Flow Meets Replicator Dynamics: A Mean-Field Analysis of Representation Learning in Actor-Critic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Actor-critic (AC) algorithms, empowered by neural networks, have had significant empirical success in recent years. However, most of the existing theoretical support for AC algorithms focuses on the case of linear function approximations, or linearized neural networks, where the feature representation is fixed throughout training. Such a limitation fails to capture the key aspect of representation learning in neural AC, which is pivotal in practical problems. In this work, we take a mean-field perspective on the evolution and convergence of feature-based neural AC. Specifically, we consider a version of AC where the actor and critic are represented by overparameterized two-layer neural networks and are updated with two-timescale learning rates. The critic is updated by temporal-difference (TD) learning with a larger stepsize while the actor is updated via proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a smaller stepsize. In the continuous-time and infinite-width limiting regime, when the timescales are properly separated, we prove that neural AC finds the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate. Additionally, we prove that the feature representation induced by the critic network is allowed to evolve within a neighborhood of the initial one.</description>

      <title>Detection of Small Holes by the Scale-Invariant Robust Density-Aware Distance (RDAD) Filtration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel topological-data-analytical (TDA) method is proposed to distinguish, from noise, small holes surrounded by high-density regions of a probability density function. The proposed method is robust against additive noise and outliers. Traditional TDA tools, like those based on the distance filtration, often struggle to distinguish small features from noise, because both have short persistences. An alternative filtration, called the Robust Density-Aware Distance (RDAD) filtration, is proposed to prolong the persistences of small holes of high-density regions. This is achieved by weighting the distance function by the density in the sense of Bell et al. The concept of distance-to-measure is incorporated to enhance stability and mitigate noise. The persistence-prolonging property and robustness of the proposed filtration are rigorously established, and numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the proposed filtration's utility in identifying small holes.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning from Partial Observation: Linear Function Approximation with Provable Sample Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with infinite observation and state spaces, which remains less investigated theoretically. To this end, we make the first attempt at bridging partial observability and function approximation for a class of POMDPs with a linear structure. In detail, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm (Optimistic Exploration via Adversarial Integral Equation or OP-TENET) that attains an $\epsilon$-optimal policy within $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ episodes. In particular, the sample complexity scales polynomially in the intrinsic dimension of the linear structure and is independent of the size of the observation and state spaces.
  The sample efficiency of OP-TENET is enabled by a sequence of ingredients: (i) a Bellman operator with finite memory, which represents the value function in a recursive manner, (ii) the identification and estimation of such an operator via an adversarial integral equation, which features a smoothed discriminator tailored to the linear structure, and (iii) the exploration of the observation and state spaces via optimism, which is based on quantifying the uncertainty in the adversarial integral equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.10490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-Box Knowledge Distillation (B2KD) is a formulated problem for cloud-to-edge model compression with invisible data and models hosted on the server. B2KD faces challenges such as limited Internet exchange and edge-cloud disparity of data distributions. In this paper, we formalize a two-step workflow consisting of deprivatization and distillation, and theoretically provide a new optimization direction from logits to cell boundary different from direct logits alignment. With its guidance, we propose a new method Mapping-Emulation KD (MEKD) that distills a black-box cumbersome model into a lightweight one. Our method does not differentiate between treating soft or hard responses, and consists of: 1) deprivatization: emulating the inverse mapping of the teacher function with a generator, and 2) distillation: aligning low-dimensional logits of the teacher and student models by reducing the distance of high-dimensional image points. For different teacher-student pairs, our method yields inspiring distillation performance on various benchmarks, and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Embed to Control Partially Observed Systems: Representation Learning with Provable Sample Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) faces two challenges. (i) It often takes the full history to predict the future, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the horizon. (ii) The observation and state spaces are often continuous, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the extrinsic dimension. Addressing such challenges requires learning a minimal but sufficient representation of the observation and state histories by exploiting the structure of the POMDP.
  To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm named Embed to Control (ETC), which learns the representation at two levels while optimizing the policy.~(i) For each step, ETC learns to represent the state with a low-dimensional feature, which factorizes the transition kernel. (ii) Across multiple steps, ETC learns to represent the full history with a low-dimensional embedding, which assembles the per-step feature. We integrate (i) and (ii) in a unified framework that allows a variety of estimators (including maximum likelihood estimators and generative adversarial networks). For a class of POMDPs with a low-rank structure in the transition kernel, ETC attains an $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity that scales polynomially with the horizon and the intrinsic dimension (that is, the rank). Here $\epsilon$ is the optimality gap. To our best knowledge, ETC is the first sample-efficient algorithm that bridges representation learning and policy optimization in POMDPs with infinite observation and state spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to learn an optimal policy from a dataset collected by a behavior policy which possibly depends on the latent state. Such a dataset is confounded in the sense that the latent state simultaneously affects the action and the observation, which is prohibitive for existing offline RL algorithms. To this end, we propose the \underline{P}roxy variable \underline{P}essimistic \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization (\texttt{P3O}) algorithm, which addresses the confounding bias and the distributional shift between the optimal and behavior policies in the context of general function approximation. At the core of \texttt{P3O} is a coupled sequence of pessimistic confidence regions constructed via proximal causal inference, which is formulated as minimax estimation. Under a partial coverage assumption on the confounded dataset, we prove that \texttt{P3O} achieves a $n^{-1/2}$-suboptimality, where $n$ is the number of trajectories in the dataset. To our best knowledge, \texttt{P3O} is the first provably efficient offline RL algorithm for POMDPs with a confounded dataset.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Latent Causal Content for Domain Adaptation under Latent Covariate Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) addresses the challenge of learning a label prediction function for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging both the labeled data from multiple source domains and the unlabeled data from the target domain. Conventional MSDA approaches often rely on covariate shift or conditional shift paradigms, which assume a consistent label distribution across domains. However, this assumption proves limiting in practical scenarios where label distributions do vary across domains, diminishing its applicability in real-world settings. For example, animals from different regions exhibit diverse characteristics due to varying diets and genetics.
  Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm called latent covariate shift (LCS), which introduces significantly greater variability and adaptability across domains. Notably, it provides a theoretical assurance for recovering the latent cause of the label variable, which we refer to as the latent content variable. Within this new paradigm, we present an intricate causal generative model by introducing latent noises across domains, along with a latent content variable and a latent style variable to achieve more nuanced rendering of observational data. We demonstrate that the latent content variable can be identified up to block identifiability due to its versatile yet distinct causal structure. We anchor our theoretical insights into a novel MSDA method, which learns the label distribution conditioned on the identifiable latent content variable, thereby accommodating more substantial distribution shifts. The proposed approach showcases exceptional performance and efficacy on both simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Estimating large causal polytrees from small samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a large causal polytree from a relatively small i.i.d. sample. This is motivated by the problem of determining causal structure when the number of variables is very large compared to the sample size, such as in gene regulatory networks. We give an algorithm that recovers the tree with high accuracy in such settings. The algorithm works under essentially no distributional or modeling assumptions other than some mild non-degeneracy conditions.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization with Unbounded Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09903v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online convex optimization (OCO) is a widely used framework in online learning. In each round, the learner chooses a decision in a convex set and an adversary chooses a convex loss function, and then the learner suffers the loss associated with their current decision. However, in many applications the learner's loss depends not only on the current decision but on the entire history of decisions until that point. The OCO framework and its existing generalizations do not capture this, and they can only be applied to many settings of interest after a long series of approximation arguments. They also leave open the question of whether the dependence on memory is tight because there are no non-trivial lower bounds. In this work we introduce a generalization of the OCO framework, "Online Convex Optimization with Unbounded Memory", that captures long-term dependence on past decisions. We introduce the notion of $p$-effective memory capacity, $H_p$, that quantifies the maximum influence of past decisions on present losses. We prove an $O(\sqrt{H_p T})$ upper bound on the policy regret and a matching (worst-case) lower bound. As a special case, we prove the first non-trivial lower bound for OCO with finite memory \citep{anavaHM2015online}, which could be of independent interest, and also improve existing upper bounds. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework by using it to derive regret bounds, and to improve and simplify existing regret bound derivations, for a variety of online learning problems including online linear control and an online variant of performative prediction.</description>

      <title>Similarity, Compression and Local Steps: Three Pillars of Efficient Communications for Distributed Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inequalities are a broad and flexible class of problems that includes minimization, saddle point, and fixed point problems as special cases. Therefore, variational inequalities are used in various applications ranging from equilibrium search to adversarial learning. With the increasing size of data and models, today's instances demand parallel and distributed computing for real-world machine learning problems, most of which can be represented as variational inequalities. Meanwhile, most distributed approaches have a significant bottleneck - the cost of communications. The three main techniques to reduce the total number of communication rounds and the cost of one such round are the similarity of local functions, compression of transmitted information, and local updates. In this paper, we combine all these approaches. Such a triple synergy did not exist before for variational inequalities and saddle problems, nor even for minimization problems. The methods presented in this paper have the best theoretical guarantees of communication complexity and are significantly ahead of other methods for distributed variational inequalities. The theoretical results are confirmed by adversarial learning experiments on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>First Order Methods with Markovian Noise: from Acceleration to Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into stochastic optimization problems that involve Markovian noise. We present a unified approach for the theoretical analysis of first-order gradient methods for stochastic optimization and variational inequalities. Our approach covers scenarios for both non-convex and strongly convex minimization problems. To achieve an optimal (linear) dependence on the mixing time of the underlying noise sequence, we use the randomized batching scheme, which is based on the multilevel Monte Carlo method. Moreover, our technique allows us to eliminate the limiting assumptions of previous research on Markov noise, such as the need for a bounded domain and uniformly bounded stochastic gradients. Our extension to variational inequalities under Markovian noise is original. Additionally, we provide lower bounds that match the oracle complexity of our method in the case of strongly convex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>PCA, SVD, and Centering of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The research detailed in this paper scrutinizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a seminal method employed in statistics and machine learning for the purpose of reducing data dimensionality. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is often employed as the primary means for computing PCA, a process that indispensably includes the step of centering - the subtraction of the mean location from the data set. In our study, we delve into a detailed exploration of the influence of this critical yet often ignored or downplayed data centering step. Our research meticulously investigates the conditions under which two PCA embeddings, one derived from SVD with centering and the other without, can be viewed as aligned. As part of this exploration, we analyze the relationship between the first singular vector and the mean direction, subsequently linking this observation to the congruity between two SVDs of centered and uncentered matrices. Furthermore, we explore the potential implications arising from the absence of centering in the context of performing PCA via SVD from a spectral analysis standpoint. Our investigation emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive understanding and acknowledgment of the subtleties involved in the computation of PCA. As such, we believe this paper offers a crucial contribution to the nuanced understanding of this foundational statistical method and stands as a valuable addition to the academic literature in the field of statistics.</description>

      <title>Consistency Trajectory Models: Learning Probability Flow ODE Trajectory of Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consistency Models (CM) (Song et al., 2023) accelerate score-based diffusion model sampling at the cost of sample quality but lack a natural way to trade-off quality for speed. To address this limitation, we propose Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM), a generalization encompassing CM and score-based models as special cases. CTM trains a single neural network that can -- in a single forward pass -- output scores (i.e., gradients of log-density) and enables unrestricted traversal between any initial and final time along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in a diffusion process. CTM enables the efficient combination of adversarial training and denoising score matching loss to enhance performance and achieves new state-of-the-art FIDs for single-step diffusion model sampling on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.73) and ImageNet at 64x64 resolution (FID 1.92). CTM also enables a new family of sampling schemes, both deterministic and stochastic, involving long jumps along the ODE solution trajectories. It consistently improves sample quality as computational budgets increase, avoiding the degradation seen in CM. Furthermore, unlike CM, CTM's access to the score function can streamline the adoption of established controllable/conditional generation methods from the diffusion community. This access also enables the computation of likelihood. The code is available at https://github.com/sony/ctm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider rather general and broad class of Markov chains, Ito chains, that look like Euler-Maryama discretization of some Stochastic Differential Equation. The chain we study is a unified framework for theoretical analysis. It comes with almost arbitrary isotropic and state-dependent noise instead of normal and state-independent one as in most related papers. Moreover, in our chain the drift and diffusion coefficient can be inexact in order to cover wide range of applications as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, sampling, Stochastic Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient Boosting. We prove the bound in $W_{2}$-distance between the laws of our Ito chain and corresponding differential equation. These results improve or cover most of the known estimates. And for some particular cases, our analysis is the first.</description>

      <title>Theoretically Grounded Loss Functions and Algorithms for Score-Based Multi-Class Abstention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning with abstention is a key scenario where the learner can abstain from making a prediction at some cost. In this paper, we analyze the score-based formulation of learning with abstention in the multi-class classification setting. We introduce new families of surrogate losses for the abstention loss function, which include the state-of-the-art surrogate losses in the single-stage setting and a novel family of loss functions in the two-stage setting. We prove strong non-asymptotic and hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees for these surrogate losses, which upper-bound the estimation error of the abstention loss function in terms of the estimation error of the surrogate loss. Our bounds can help compare different score-based surrogates and guide the design of novel abstention algorithms by minimizing the proposed surrogate losses. We experimentally evaluate our new algorithms on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets and the practical significance of our new surrogate losses and two-stage abstention algorithms. Our results also show that the relative performance of the state-of-the-art score-based surrogate losses can vary across datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the key framework of learning with abstention in the multi-class classification setting. In this setting, the learner can choose to abstain from making a prediction with some pre-defined cost. We present a series of new theoretical and algorithmic results for this learning problem in the predictor-rejector framework. We introduce several new families of surrogate losses for which we prove strong non-asymptotic and hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, thereby resolving positively two existing open questions. These guarantees provide upper bounds on the estimation error of the abstention loss function in terms of that of the surrogate loss. We analyze both a single-stage setting where the predictor and rejector are learned simultaneously and a two-stage setting crucial in applications, where the predictor is learned in a first stage using a standard surrogate loss such as cross-entropy. These guarantees suggest new multi-class abstention algorithms based on minimizing these surrogate losses. We also report the results of extensive experiments comparing these algorithms to the current state-of-the-art algorithms on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. Our results demonstrate empirically the benefit of our new surrogate losses and show the remarkable performance of our broadly applicable two-stage abstention algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of surrogate losses and algorithms for the general problem of learning to defer with multiple experts. We first introduce a new family of surrogate losses specifically tailored for the multiple-expert setting, where the prediction and deferral functions are learned simultaneously. We then prove that these surrogate losses benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. We illustrate the application of our analysis through several examples of practical surrogate losses, for which we give explicit guarantees. These loss functions readily lead to the design of new learning to defer algorithms based on their minimization. While the main focus of this work is a theoretical analysis, we also report the results of several experiments on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some settings neural networks exhibit a phenomenon known as \textit{grokking}, where they achieve perfect or near-perfect accuracy on the validation set long after the same performance has been achieved on the training set. In this paper, we discover that grokking is not limited to neural networks but occurs in other settings such as Gaussian process (GP) classification, GP regression, linear regression and Bayesian neural networks. We also uncover a mechanism by which to induce grokking on algorithmic datasets via the addition of dimensions containing spurious information. The presence of the phenomenon in non-neural architectures shows that grokking is not restricted to settings considered in current theoretical and empirical studies. Instead, grokking may be possible in any model where solution search is guided by complexity and error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper endeavors to augment the robustness of offline reinforcement learning (RL) in scenarios laden with heavy-tailed rewards, a prevalent circumstance in real-world applications. We propose two algorithmic frameworks, ROAM and ROOM, for robust off-policy evaluation and offline policy optimization (OPO), respectively. Central to our frameworks is the strategic incorporation of the median-of-means method with offline RL, enabling straightforward uncertainty estimation for the value function estimator. This not only adheres to the principle of pessimism in OPO but also adeptly manages heavy-tailed rewards. Theoretical results and extensive experiments demonstrate that our two frameworks outperform existing methods on the logged dataset exhibits heavy-tailed reward distributions. The implementation of the proposal is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/ROOM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02766v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laplace's method approximates a target density with a Gaussian distribution at its mode. It is computationally efficient and asymptotically exact for Bayesian inference due to the Bernstein-von Mises theorem, but for complex targets and finite-data posteriors it is often too crude an approximation. A recent generalization of the Laplace Approximation transforms the Gaussian approximation according to a chosen Riemannian geometry providing a richer approximation family, while still retaining computational efficiency. However, as shown here, its properties depend heavily on the chosen metric, indeed the metric adopted in previous work results in approximations that are overly narrow as well as being biased even at the limit of infinite data. We correct this shortcoming by developing the approximation family further, deriving two alternative variants that are exact at the limit of infinite data, extending the theoretical analysis of the method, and demonstrating practical improvements in a range of experiments.</description>

      <title>Fun with Flags: Robust Principal Directions via Flag Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA), along with its extensions to manifolds and outlier contaminated data, have been indispensable in computer vision and machine learning. In this work, we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants, and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces, ie a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension, which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants, not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpretations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality reduction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach, we recast robust and dual forms of PCA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework, creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the 'flagification' introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types. Last but not least, we propose an effective convergent solver for these flag-formulations employing the Stiefel manifold. Our empirical results on both real-world and synthetic scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of our novel algorithms, especially in terms of robustness to outliers on manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning, which involves running machine learning algorithms on quantum devices, has garnered significant attention in both academic and business circles. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive and unbiased review of the various concepts that have emerged in the field of quantum machine learning. This includes techniques used in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technologies and approaches for algorithms compatible with fault-tolerant quantum computing hardware. Our review covers fundamental concepts, algorithms, and the statistical learning theory pertinent to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Causal Bayesian Optimization via Exogenous Distribution Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximizing a target variable as an operational objective in a structured causal model is an important problem. Existing Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) methods either rely on hard interventions that alter the causal structure to maximize the reward; or introduce action nodes to endogenous variables so that the data generation mechanisms are adjusted to achieve the objective. In this paper, a novel method is introduced to learn the distribution of exogenous variables, which is typically ignored or marginalized through expectation by existing methods. Exogenous distribution learning improves the approximation accuracy of structured causal models in a surrogate model that is usually trained with limited observational data. Moreover, the learned exogenous distribution extends existing CBO to general causal schemes beyond Additive Noise Models (ANM). The recovery of exogenous variables allows us to use a more flexible prior for noise or unobserved hidden variables. A new CBO method is developed by leveraging the learned exogenous distribution. Experiments on different datasets and applications show the benefits of our proposed method.</description>
