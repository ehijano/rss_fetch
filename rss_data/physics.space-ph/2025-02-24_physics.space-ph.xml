      <title>Forecasting Local Ionospheric Parameters Using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for forecasting key ionospheric parameters using transformer-based neural networks. The model provides accurate forecasts and uncertainty quantification of the F2-layer peak plasma frequency (foF2), the F2-layer peak density height (hmF2), and total electron content (TEC) for a given geographic location. It supports a number of exogenous variables, including F10.7cm solar flux and disturbance storm time (Dst). We demonstrate how transformers can be trained in a data assimilation-like fashion that use these exogenous variables along with na\"ive predictions from climatology to generate 24-hour forecasts with non-parametric uncertainty bounds. We call this method the Local Ionospheric Forecast Transformer (LIFT). We demonstrate that the trained model can generalize to new geographic locations and time periods not seen during training, and we compare its performance to that of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI).</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the Relationships between Solar Flares and Source Active Regions</title>

Abstract: Solar flares are defined as outbursts on the surface of the Sun. They occur when energy accumulated in magnetic fields enclosing solar active regions (ARs) is abruptly expelled. Solar flares and associated coronal mass ejections are sources of space weather that adversely impact devices at or near Earth, including the obstruction of high-frequency radio waves utilized for communication and the deterioration of power grid operations. Tracking and delivering early and precise predictions of solar flares is essential for readiness and catastrophe risk mitigation. This paper employs the random forest (RF) model to address the binary classification task, analyzing the links between solar flares and their originating ARs with observational data gathered from 2011 to 2021 by SolarMonitor.org and the XRT flare database. We seek to identify the physical features of a source AR that significantly influence its potential to trigger &gt;=C-class flares. We found that the features of AR_Type_Today, Hale_Class_Yesterday are the most and the least prepotent features, respectively. NoS_Difference has a remarkable effect in decision-making in both global and local interpretations.</description>

      <title>Electron Beam Propagation and Radio-Wave Scattering in the Inner Heliosphere using Five Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles such as electrons can be accelerated to mildly-relativistic velocities in the solar corona. These electrons travel through the turbulent corona generating radio waves, which are then severely affected by scattering. The physical interpretation of the discrepancies between the actual and observed radio sources is still subject to debate. Here, we use radio emission observed by an unprecedented total of five spacecraft, to track the path of radio sources from the low corona to the inner heliosphere (15-75 R$_{\odot}$) generated during a solar event on 4 December 2021. In this study we use the Bayesian multilateration technique known as BELLA to track the apparent path of radio sources observed by Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, Wind, Solar Orbiter and Mars Express. To validate the accuracy of the tracked path, we used Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph interferometric imaging at 150 MHz, which was found to agree with the estimated footpoints predicted by BELLA. We also further validated our results using ACE in-situ measurements. We found that the apparent radio sources followed the path of a Parker Spiral, with an associated solar wind velocity of approximately 493 km s-1 (consistent with the corresponding speed observed at 1 au at the relevant longitude) and connected to 75$^\circ$ longitude East at the solar surface. Finally, we made quantitative estimates of the scattering of radio waves that were found to be in good agreement with contemporary models of scattering. This work shows conclusive evidence that the disputed cause of the widely observed `higher than expected' electron densities at interplanetary distances is due to radio wave scattering, and provides a more detailed understanding of the propagation of radio waves emitted near the local plasma frequency in turbulent plasmas.</description>

      <title>Forecasting and Analysis of Solar Energetic Particle Radiation Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar Energetic Particle (SEPs) with energies ranging from tens of keV to a few GeV, are a significant component in the description of the space environment. In this work, the HESPERIA REleASE product is emphasized, which, based on the Relativistic Electron Alert System for Exploration (REleASE) forecasting scheme, generates real-time predictions of the proton flux (30-50 MeV) at L1, making use of relativistic and near-relativistic electron measurements by the SOHO/EPHIN and ACE/EPAM experiments, respectively. The HESPERIA REleASE Alert is a notification system based on the forecasts produced by the HESPERIA REleASE product and informs about the expected radiation impact in real-time using an illustration and a distribution system for registered users. We also present and discuss the Advance Warning Times derived for the compiled list of major SEP events successfully forecasted over the last 2.5 years dur-ing solar cycle 25 by HESPERIA REleASE and recent developments.</description>
