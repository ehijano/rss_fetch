      <title>Orbital Stability of Closely-Spaced Four-planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital dynamics of four-planet systems consisting of Earth-mass planets on initially-circular, coplanar orbits around a star of one solar mass. In our simulations, the innermost planet's semimajor axis is set at 1 AU, with subsequent semimajor axes spaced equally in terms of planets' mutual Hill radii. Several sets of initial planetary longitudes are investigated, with integrations continuing for up to $10^{10}$ orbits of the innermost planet, stopping if a pair of planets pass within 0.01 AU of each other or if a planet is ejected from the system. We find that the simulated lifetimes of four-planet systems follow the general trend of increasing exponentially with planetary spacing, as seen by previous studies of closely-spaced planets. Four-planet system lifetimes are intermediate between those of three- and five-planet systems and more similar to the latter. Moreover, as with five-planet systems, but in marked contrast to the three-planet case, no initial semimajor axes spacings are found to yield systems that survive several orders of magnitude longer than other similar spacings. First- and second-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs) between planets correlate with reductions in system lifetimes. Additionally, we find that third-order MMRs between planets on neighboring orbits also have a substantial, though smaller, destabilizing effect on systems very near resonance that otherwise would be very long-lived. Local extrema of system lifetimes as a function of planetary spacing occur at slightly smaller initial orbital separation for systems with planets initially at conjunction relative to those in which the planets begin on widely-separated longitudes. This shift is produced by the asymmetric mutual planetary perturbations as the planets separate in longitude from the initial aligned configuration that cause orbits to spread out in semimajor axis.</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) I: Motivation, sample, data reduction, and results overview</title>

Abstract: The outer regions of planetary systems host dusty debris discs analogous to the Kuiper belt (exoKuiper belts), which provide crucial constraints on planet formation and evolution processes. ALMA dust observations have revealed a great diversity, and that some belts contain CO gas, whose origin and implications are uncertain. Most of this progress, however, has been limited by low-resolution observations. We conducted the first ALMA large programme dedicated to debris discs: the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS). We selected the 24 most promising belts to constrain their detailed radial and vertical structure, and to characterise the gas content. We constrained the radial and vertical distribution of dust, as well as the presence of asymmetries. For a subset of six belts with CO gas, we constrained the gas distribution and kinematics. To interpret these observations, we used a wide range of dynamical models. The first ARKS results are presented as a series of ten papers. We discovered that up to 33% of our sample exhibits multiple dusty rings. For highly inclined belts, we found that non-Gaussian vertical distributions are common and are indicative of multiple dynamical populations. We also found that 10 of the 24 belts present asymmetries. We find that the CO gas is radially broader than the dust, but this could be an effect of optical depth. At least one system shows non-Keplerian kinematics due to strong pressure gradients, which may have triggered a vortex that trapped dust in an arc. Finally, we find evidence that the micron-sized grains may be affected by gas drag in gas rich systems. ARKS has revealed a great diversity of structures in exoKuiper belts that may arise when they are formed in protoplanetary discs or subsequently via interactions with planets and/or gas. We encourage the community to explore the reduced data and data products.</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) IX: Gas-driven origin for the continuum arc in the debris disc of HD 121617</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris discs were long considered to be largely gas-free environments governed by collisional fragmentation, gravitational stirring, and radiative forces. Recent CO detections show that gas is present, but its abundance and origin remain uncertain. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) revealed a narrow gas and dust ring in the disc HD 121617 with an asymmetric arc 40% brighter than the rest of the ring. We aim to constrain the total gas mass in HD 121617 assuming the dust arc is produced by hydrodynamical gas-dust interactions. We used the Dusty FARGO-ADSG code, modelling dust as Lagrangian particles, including radiation pressure and dust feedback, and varying the total gas mass. Simulations were compared to observations using radiative transfer. An unstable gas ring creates a size-dependent radial and azimuthal dust trap whose efficiency depends on gas mass. Two models, with 50 and 5 Earth masses of gas, reproduce both the ALMA band 7 arc and the outward offset of the VLT/SPHERE scattered-light ring via gas drag and radiation pressure. We infer a conservative gas-mass range of 2.5 to 250 Earth masses. If the ALMA asymmetry is caused by gas drag, the required gas mass compared with the observed CO implies substantial H2, consistent with primordial gas. HD 121617 would then be a hybrid disc between protoplanetary and debris stages. Since a planet could also create an arc, future observations are needed to distinguish these scenarios.</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) VIII: A dust arc and non-Keplerian gas kinematics in HD 121617</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ExoKuiper belts around young A-type stars often host CO gas, whose origin is still unclear. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) includes 6 of these gas-bearing belts, to characterise their dust and gas distributions and investigate the gas origin. As part of ARKS, we observed the gas-rich system HD121617 and discovered an arc of enhanced dust density. In this paper, we analyse in detail the dust and gas distributions and the gas kinematics of this system. We extracted radial and azimuthal profiles of the dust (in the millimetre and near-infrared) and gas emission ($^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO) from reconstructed images. To constrain the morphology of the arc, we fitted an asymmetric model to the dust emission. To characterise the gas kinematics, we fitted a Keplerian model to the velocity map and extracted the azimuthal velocity profile by deprojecting the data. We find that the dust arc is narrow (1-5 au wide at a radius of 75 au), azimuthally extended, and asymmetric; the emission is more azimuthally compact in the direction of the system's rotation, and represents 13% of the total dust mass (0.2$M_\oplus$). The arc is much less pronounced or absent for small grains and gas. Finally, we find strong non-Keplerian azimuthal velocities at the inner and outer wings of the ring, as was expected due to strong pressure gradients. The dust arc resembles the asymmetries found in protoplanetary discs, often interpreted as the result of dust trapping in vortices. If the gas disc mass is high enough ($\gtrsim20M_\oplus$, requiring a primordial gas origin), both the radial confinement of the ring and the azimuthal arc may result from dust grains responding to gas drag. Alternatively, it could result from planet-disc interactions via mean motion resonances. Further studies should test these hypotheses and may provide a dynamical gas mass estimate in this CO-rich exoKuiper belt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CO gas is detected in a significant number of debris discs, but its origin and evolution remains unclear. Key constraints are its mass and spectro-spatial distribution, which are coupled through optical depth and have only been analysed at low to moderate resolution so far. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is the first ALMA large program to target debris discs at high spectro-spatial resolution. We used $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO J=3-2 line data of 18 ARKS debris belts, 5 of which were already known to host gas, to analyse the spectro-spatial distribution of CO, constrain the gas masses, and to search for gas in the remaining systems. We developed a line-imaging pipeline and produced line cubes for each disc, with a spatial resolution down to $\sim$70 mas and spectral resolution of 26 m s$^{-1}$. Using spectro-spatial shifting and stacking, we produced high signal-to-noise maps, and radial and spectral profiles that reveal the distribution and kinematics of gas in 5 gas-bearing discs. For these discs, we constrained the inner radius of the $^{12}$CO, and found the radial brightness profile of CO peaked interior to the dust ring, but that CO was more radially extended than the dust. We present the first radially resolved $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotopologue flux ratios in gas-bearing debris discs, which are constant with radius for the majority of systems, indicating $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO are both optically thick or thin throughout the discs. We report CO line fluxes/upper limits for all systems and optical depth dependant masses for the 5 gas-bearing systems. Finally, we analysed the $^{12}$CO J=3-2 line luminosities for the ARKS debris discs and discs from the literature. We confirm that gas is mostly detected in young systems. However, the high scatter seen in young/high fractional luminosity systems indicates no trend within the systems with detected gas.</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS). X. Interpreting the peculiar dust rings around HD 131835</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty discs detected around main-sequence stars are thought to be signs of planetesimal belts in which the dust distribution is shaped by collisional and dynamical processes, including interactions with gas if present. The debris disc around the young A-type star HD 131835 is composed of two dust rings at ~65 au and ~100 au, a third unconstrained innermost component, and a gaseous component centred at ~65 au. New ALMA observations show that the inner of the two dust rings is brighter than the outer one, in contrast with previous observations in scattered light. We explore two scenarios that could explain these observations: the two dust rings might represent distinct planetesimal belts with different collisional properties, or only the inner ring might contain planetesimals while the outer ring consists entirely of dust that has migrated outwards due to gas drag. To explore the first scenario, we employed a state-of-the-art collisional evolution code. To test the second scenario, we used a simple dynamical model of dust grain evolution in an optically thin gaseous disc. Collisional models of two planetesimal belts cannot fully reproduce the observations by only varying their dynamical excitation, and matching the data through a different material strength requires an extreme difference in dust composition. The gas-driven scenario can reproduce the location of the outer ring and the brightness ratio of the two rings from scattered light observations, but the resulting outer ring is too faint overall in both scattered light and sub-millimetre emission. The dust rings in HD 131835 could be produced from two planetesimal belts, although how these belts would attain the required extremely different properties needs to be explained. The dust-gas interaction is a plausible alternative explanation and deserves further study using a more comprehensive model.</description>

Abstract: Asymmetries in debris discs provide unique clues to understand the evolution and architecture of planetary systems.** The aim of the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is to expand our understanding of radial and vertical dust structures, as well as gas distributions and kinematics, in debris discs.** Here, in ARKS~VI, we present a systematic analysis of the asymmetries and stellocentric offsets present in the ALMA continuum data for the ARKS survey. Our aims are to identify asymmetries in debris disc dust distributions, quantify debris disc asymmetry properties, and discuss the potential origins of debris disc asymmetries.** We utilised empirical methods to identify emission asymmetries** and the presence of offset emission between disc centres and the locations of the host stars, via an analysis of their calibration procedures and disc properties. We associated observational asymmetry types** and plausible physical classes** associated with each source. We show that there are ten systems, almost half of the ARKS sample, that host either a continuum emission asymmetry or offset emission. Three systems host offsets (HD15115, HD32297, and HD109573 (HR4796)), four host azimuthal asymmetries (HD9672 (49Ceti), HD92945, HD107146, and HD121617), two host an asymmetry in their major axis (HD10647 (q$^1$ Eri), and HD39060 ($\beta$ Pic)), and one hosts an asymmetry in their minor axis (HD61005). We attribute the offset asymmetries to non-zero eccentricities, and three of the azimuthal asymmetries to arcs. The presence of an asymmetry or offset in the ARKS sample appears to be correlated with the fractional luminosity of cold dust.** Conclusions: This study demonstrates that debris disc asymmetries in the ARKS sample are common, and plausibly so in the wider population of debris discs at (sub)-millimetre wavelengths.** ** = ABRIDGED FOR ARXIV: FULL ABSTRACT IN PAPER</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Study of Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF): Complementary ALMA and JWST Investigations of Water and Methanol in Cometary Comae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period comets, which are often considered to be representative of material in the protoplanetary disk that formed the Solar System, are ideal to investigate the question of chemical inheritance in astronomy. Determining the chemistry of comets, both individually and as a population, has become of great importance in comparative studies against sources representative of evolutionary precursors to planetary systems. Contemporaneous observations of long-period comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) were obtained with the JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in early 2023 March. This work focuses on \ce{CH3OH} measurements from both ALMA and JWST as well as \ce{H2O} measurements from JWST. Radiative transfer modeling of \ce{CH3OH} and \ce{H2O} was performed to investigate spatial variations in rotational temperature, column density, and production rates, as well as a comparison of derived values between the two telescopes. Most of the spatial distributions of the modeled values are centrally peaked, and the modeled values from JWST are all within the error bars of the average values from ALMA. C/2022 E3 (ZTF) also displays an enhancement in modeled rotational temperature in the anti-Sunward direction that is shown to be statistically significant. Based on non-LTE radiative transfer modeling, the declining \ce{H2O} rotational temperatures as a function of nucleocentric distance observed by JWST can be explained primarily as a result of rotational line cooling. The values derived in this work are in general agreement with single-dish millimeter-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Increased and Varied Radiation during the Sun's Encounters with Cold Clouds in the last 10 million years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research raises the possibility that 3 and 7 million years ago, the Sun encountered massive clouds that shrank the heliosphere--the solar cocoon protecting our solar system--exposing Earth to its interstellar environment, in agreement with geological evidence from 60Fe and 244Pu isotopes. Here we show that during such encounters Earth was exposed to increased radiation in the form of high-energy particles. During periods of Earth's immersion in the heliosphere, it received particle radiation that we name Heliospheric Energetic Particles (HEPs). The intensity of &lt; 10 MeV protons was at least an order of magnitude more intense than today's most extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events. SEPs today last minutes to hours, but HEP exposure then lasted for extensive periods of several months, making it a prolonged external driver. During Earth's excursion outside the heliosphere, it was exposed to a galactic cosmic ray radiation with the intensity of &lt; 1 GeV protons at least an order of magnitude more intense than today. Therefore, the space surrounding Earth was permeated by a variable high-energy radiation. We discuss the implications for Earth's climate and biodiversity.</description>

Abstract: CO gas has been detected in $\sim$20 debris discs. We present ALMA observations of the CO-rich HD 121617 debris disc from the ARKS survey. Using high-resolution Band 7 observations of $^{12}CO \ J=3-2$, we analyse local CO line profiles to investigate optical depth, CO mass, and temperature. Spectra are aligned and stacked in concentric annuli to produce local line profiles. The resulting profiles are Gaussian-shaped and broadened by Keplerian shear. The line profiles are modelled using both a simplified toy model and a RADMC-3D model including projection effects and Keplerian shear. Fitting the RADMC-3D model to the $^{13}$CO data, we find that an optically thick model with a temperature of 38 K and a CO mass of $2 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\oplus}$ reproduces the observations. The model reproduces the enhanced emission at orbital azimuths of $\sim \pm45^{\circ}$ and $\pm135^{\circ}$, forming an X-shaped structure in the velocity-integrated intensity map, as well as the broader $^{12}$CO linewidth relative to $^{13}$CO. Scaling the model by the ISM abundance ratio ($\sim$77) also reproduces the $^{12}$CO data, though high optical depths and model assumptions limit mass constraints. We find that azimuthally averaged local line profiles appear Gaussian regardless of optical depth, cautioning against their use for distinguishing optically thin and thick emission. We constrain the mean molecular weight to $12.6_{-1.1}^{+1.3}$, dependent on model assumptions. Our $^{13}$CO results suggest that C$^{18}$O may also be optically thick in CO-rich debris discs and that the mean molecular weight is significantly higher than if H$_2$ were the dominant gas species, suggesting a non-primordial composition.</description>

      <title>Data Mining-Based Cislunar Escape-Family Analysis in The Multi-Body Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Escape trajectories from the Earth-Moon system play an important role in interplanetary transfer. This paper focuses on the escape trajectories from a 167 km circular Earth orbit in the Earth-Moon planar circular three-body problem and the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular four-body problem and is denoted to providing a comprehensive analysis on these escape trajectories. To achieve these purposes, the global maps of escape trajectories are constructed, and escape trajectories with one lunar gravity assist are pre-filtered. Then, an effective method to identification escape families is proposed based on dynamical analysis and data mining techniques. Once the escape families are identified, the corresponding characteristics are analyzed to provide insights into the construction of escape trajectories. Based on these escape families, the effects of the solar gravity perturbation on the number of escape trajectories, the emergence and disappearance of escape families, variation in generalized energy, and transfer characteristics are further summarized, providing insights into the model selection in the escape trajectory construction. This paper establishes an analysis methodology of escape trajectories from a perspective of escape families, deepening the understanding of escape dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibrium points in modified elliptic restricted three-body problem with various perturbation sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamics of the third body in an elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP) framework, taking into account perturbations from radiation pressure, oblateness, and elongation of the primary bodies, as well as disk-like structures. The objectives are to determine the positions and stability of the equilibrium points, asses how these points shift under the influence of perturbations, and evaluate the dependence of their stability on the orbital eccentricity and perturbation parameters. The ERTBP model is modified to include a radiating, oblate primary body and an elongated secondary body modeled as a finite straight segment, alongside perturbations from a surrounding disk. The system's equations of motion are numerically solved using parameters from perturbed and classical cases. Equilibrium positions are computed over a range of eccentricities and perturbation values, and stability is analyzed using linearized equations and eigenvalue methods. In all cases, we have found three collinear ($L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$) and two non-collinear ($L_4$, $L_5$) equilibrium points solutions. The inclusion of radiations, oblateness, elongation using a finite straight segment, and disk perturbation systematically displaces each equilibrium point from its classical location, with the magnitude and direction of the displacement varying with the perturbation parameter. Stability analysis confirms that the collinear points remain linearly stable under all tested conditions. Meanwhile, non-collinear points are stable under a specific condition. We investigate the stability boundary of these points as a function of orbital eccentricity and we found there is a critical range of eccentricity values within which stability is preserved.</description>

      <title>Interior dynamics of envelopes around disk-embedded planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the core accretion scenario, forming planets start to acquire gaseous envelopes while accreting solids. Conventional one-dimensional models assume envelopes to be static and isolated. However, recent three-dimensional simulations demonstrate dynamic gas exchange from the envelope to the surrounding disk. This process is controlled by the balance between heating, through the accretion of solids, and cooling, which is regulated by poorly-known opacities. In this work, we systemically investigate a wide range of cooling and heating rates, using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We identify three distinct cooling regimes. Fast-cooling envelopes ($\beta \lesssim 1$, with $\beta$ the cooling time in units of orbital time) are nearly isothermal and have inner radiative layers that are shielded from recycling flows. In contrast, slow cooling envelopes ($\beta\gtrsim10^3$) become fully convective. In the intermediate regime ($1\lesssim\beta\lesssim300$), envelopes are characterized by a three-layer structure, comprising an inner convective, a middle radiative, and an outer recycling layer. The development of this radiative layer traps small dust and vapour released from sublimated species. In contrast, fully convective envelopes efficiently exchange material from inner to outer envelope. Such fully convective envelopes are likely to emerge in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks ($\lesssim$ 1 au) where cooling times are long, implying that inner-disk super-Earths may see their growth stalled and be volatile depleted.</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) III: The vertical structure of debris disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris disks -- collisionally sustained belts of dust and sometimes gas around main sequence stars -- are remnants of planet formation processes and are found in systems ${\gtrsim}10$ Myr old. Millimeter-wavelength observations are particularly important, as the grains probed by these observations are not strongly affected by radiation pressure and stellar winds, allowing them to probe the dynamics of large bodies producing dust. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is analyzing high-resolution observations of 24 debris disks to enable the characterization of debris disk substructures across a large sample for the first time. For the most highly inclined disks, it is possible to recover the vertical structure of the disk. We aim to model and analyze the most highly inclined systems in the ARKS sample in order to uniformly extract the vertical dust distributions for a sample of well-resolved debris disks. We employed both parametric and nonparametric methods to constrain the vertical dust distributions for the most highly inclined ARKS targets. We find a broad range of aspect ratios, revealing a wide diversity in vertical structure, with a range of best-fit parametric values of $0.0026 \leq h_{\rm HWHM} \leq 0.193$ and a median best-fit value of $h_{\rm HWHM}=0.021$. The results obtained by nonparametric modeling are generally consistent with the parametric modeling results. We find that five of the 13 disks are consistent with having total disk masses less than that of Neptune (17 $M_{\oplus}$), assuming stirring by internal processes (self-stirring and collisional and frictional damping). Furthermore, most systems show a significant preference for a Lorentzian vertical profile rather than a Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the exoplanet radius valley with host stars from SWEET-Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radius valley,a deficit of planets near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$, was observed among exoplanets of radius $\lesssim$ 5 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ with periods $&lt;$ 100 days by NASA's $Kepler$ mission. It separates super-Earths (rocky, $\lesssim 1.9$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) from sub-Neptunes (volatile-rich, $\gtrsim 2$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and may arise from formation conditions or atmospheric loss. Disentangling these mechanisms has led to numerous studies of population-level trends, although the resulting interpretations remain sensitive to sample selection and the robustness of host-star parameters. We re-examine its existence, depth, and dependence on period, flux, stellar mass, and age. Using SWEET-Cat and MAISTEP tool, we derived stellar parameters for 1,221 main-sequence stars (1,405 planets), with effective temperatures 4400--7500 K and radii 0.62--2.75 $\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$, achieving 2\% precision in radius and mass. Planetary radii were recomputed from radius ratios, yielding 5\% median uncertainty. The valley is partially filled near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and depends on period, flux, and stellar mass, with slopes $-0.12^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$, $0.10^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, and $0.19^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. Sub-Neptunes show a stronger stellar mass-dependent trend than super-Earths ($0.17^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ vs $0.11^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$). With stellar age, the super-Earth/sub-Neptune ratio rises from $0.51^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$ ($&lt;3$ Gyr) to $0.64^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$ ($\gtrsim3$ Gyr), and the valley becomes shallower and shifts to larger radii. A 4D fit shows consistent slopes with 2D analyses and a weaker age trend ($0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$). These results suggest prolonged atmospheric loss, which is consistent with a core-powered mass loss scenario and emphasize the need for improved determinations, a goal expected to be achieved by future missions like PLATO.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Planetary Tidal Disruption Events Around Solar-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12501v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal disruption of planets by their host stars represents a growing area of interest in transient astronomy, offering insights into the final stages of planetary system evolution. We model the hydrodynamic evolution and predict the multi-wavelength observational signatures of planetary TDEs around a solar-mass host, focusing on Jupiter-like and Neptune-like progenitors and examining how different eccentricities of the planet's pre-disruption orbit shape the morphology and emission of the tidal debris. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the FARGO3D code to model the formation and viscous evolution of the resulting debris disk. We employ a viscous alpha-disk prescription and include a time-dependent energy equation to compute the disk's effective temperature and subsequently derive the bolometric and multi-band photometric light curves. Our simulations show that planetary TDEs produce a diverse range of luminous transients. A Jupiter-like planet disrupted from a circular orbit at the Roche limit generates a transient peaking at $L_{bol} \approx 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after a 12-day rise. In contrast, the same planet on an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) produces a transient of comparable peak luminosity but on a much shorter timescale, peaking in only 1 day and followed by a highly volatile light curve. We find that the effect of eccentricity is not universal, as it accelerates the event for Jupiter but delays it for Neptune. A robust "bluer-when-brighter" colour evolution is a common feature as the disk cools over its multi-year lifetime. The strong dependence of light curve morphology on the initial orbit and progenitor mass makes these events powerful diagnostics. This framework is crucial for identifying planetary TDEs in time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Analytic Modeling of Tidally Locked Rocky Planet Atmospheres Across Dynamical Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new first-principles analytic approach to interpreting eclipses and phase curves of rocky planets. Observations with JWST have reported nondetections of atmospheres around the majority of hot rocky planets orbiting M dwarfs. However, most of these "bare rock" inferences are based on models that are ill-suited to many currently observable planets, as they were developed for use on cooler, slower-rotating bodies. In particular, these models rely on the weak temperature gradient assumption, in which rotation is neglected and temperature gradients can be simply related to wind speeds. We find that this assumption may not be valid for over 40% of terrestrials observed with JWST, including TRAPPIST-1b, GJ 367b, and TOI-2445b. Our simple new four-box model does not rely on this assumption, and instead allows the heat transport efficiency to be specified or follow scalings derived herein. This method is fast, interpretable, physically motivated, reproduces previous general circulation model results, and can be used as a starting point for more detailed modeling. We observe that the longitudinal temperature structure of tidally locked terrestrials depends strongly on the atmospheric circulation. Considering the applicable range of atmospheric dynamical regimes, we find that a given planet's nightside temperature can plausibly vary by 100s of Kelvin (from detectable to undetectable). Furthermore, a planet's dayside energy balance can display complex behavior, with degeneracies between surface pressure and dayside temperature. Illustrating an application to observations, we find that assumptions about atmospheric dynamics and longitudinal temperature structure can bias atmospheric constraints at the order-of-magnitude level.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy of mass and size measurements of young protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing the masses and sizes of protoplanetary disks is of fundamental importance for the contemporary theories of planet formation. However, their measurements are associated with large uncertainties. In this proof of concept study, we focus on the very early stages of disk evolution, concurrent with the formation of the protostellar seed, because it is then that the initial conditions for subsequent planet formation are likely established. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk followed by radiation transfer postprocessing, we constructed synthetic disk images at millimeter wavelengths. We then calculated the synthetic disk radii and masses using an algorithm that is often applied to observations of protoplanetary disks with ALMA, and compared the resulting values with the actual disk mass and size derived directly from hydrodynamic modeling. We paid specific attention to the effects of dust growth on the discrepancy between synthetic and intrinsic disk masses and radii. We find that the dust mass is likely underestimated in Band 6 by factors of 1.4-4.2 when Ossenkopf &amp; Henning opacities and typical dust temperatures are used, but the discrepancy reduces in Band~3, where the dust mass can be even overestimated. Dust growth affects both disk mass and size estimates via the dust-size-dependent opacity, and extremely low values of dust temperature (~ several Kelvin) are required to recover the intrinsic dust mass when dust has grown to mm-sized grains and its opacity has increased. Dust mass estimates are weakly sensitive to the distance to the source, while disk radii may be seriously affected. We conclude that the accuracy of measuring the dust mass and disk radius during the formation of a protoplanetary disk also depends on the progress in dust growth. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) V: Comparison between scattered light and thermal emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris discs are analogues to our own Kuiper belt around main-sequence stars and are therefore referred to as exoKuiper belts. They have been resolved at high angular resolution at wavelengths spanning the optical to the submillimetre-millimetre regime. Short wavelengths probe the light scattered by such discs, which is dominated by micron-sized dust particles, while millimetre wavelengths probe the thermal emission of millimetre-sized particles. Determining differences in the dust distribution between millimetre- and micron-sized dust is fundamental to revealing the dynamical processes affecting the dust in debris discs. We aim to compare the scattered light from the discs of the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) with the thermal emission probed by ALMA. We focus on the radial distribution of the dust. We used high-contrast scattered light observations obtained with VLT/SPHERE, GPI, and the HST to uniformly study the dust distribution in those systems and compare it to the dust distribution extracted from the ALMA observations carried out in the course of the ARKS project. We also set constraints on the presence of planets by using these high-contrast images combined with exoplanet evolutionary models. 15 of the 24 discs comprising the ARKS sample are detected in scattered light, with TYC9340-437-1 being imaged for the first time at near-infrared wavelengths. For 6 of those 15 discs, the dust surface density seen in scattered light peaks farther out compared to that observed with ALMA. These 6 discs except one are known to also host cold CO gas. Conversely, the systems without significant offsets are not known to host gas, except one. This observational study suggests that the presence of gas in debris discs may affect the small and large grains differently, pushing the small dust to greater distances where the gas is less abundant.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids Flybys Using Multiple Venus Gravity Assists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops low-energy spacecraft (SC) trajectories using Venus gravity assists to study asteroids during heliocentric transfer segments between planetary encounters. The study focuses on potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) as primary exploration targets. This paper proposes a method for calculating SC trajectories that enable asteroid flybys after a Venus gravity assist. The method involves formulating and solving an optimization problem to design trajectories incorporating flybys of selected asteroids and Venus. Trajectories are calculated using two-body dynamics by solving the Lambert problem. A preliminary search for candidate asteroids uses an algorithm to narrow the search space of the optimization problem. This algorithm uses the V-infinity globe technique to connect planetary gravity assists with resonant orbits. The resonant orbit in this case serves as an initial approximation for the SC's trajectory between two successive planetary flybys. Four flight schemes were analyzed, including multiple flybys of Venus and asteroids, with the possibility of an SC returning to Earth. The proposed solutions reduce flight time between asteroid approaches, increase gravity assist frequency, and enhance mission design flexibility. The use of Venus gravity assists and resonant orbits ensures a close encounter with at least one asteroid during the SC's trajectory between two consecutive flybys of Venus, and demonstrates the feasibility of periodic Venus gravity assists and encounters with PHAs. The developed method was applied to construct trajectories that allow an SC to approach both Venus-resonant asteroids and PHAs via multiple Venus gravity assists. An additional study was carried out to identify asteroids accessible during the Earth-Venus segment in launch windows between 2029 and 2050.</description>

      <title>Exploring rotational properties and the YORP effect in asteroid families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term dynamical evolution of asteroid families is governed by the interplay between orbital and rotational evolution driven by thermal forces and collision. We aim to observationally trace the rotational evolution of main-belt asteroid families over Gyr timescales. We analyzed rotational properties of 8739 asteroids with spin period measurements and 3794 asteroids with obliquity determinations across 28 asteroid families spanning ages from 14~Myrs to 3~Gyrs. We introduced a dimensionless timescale that normalizes each asteroid's family age by its classical YORP timescale, enabling direct comparison of rotational states across different evolutionary stages. We examined two key observables: the fraction of slow rotators (periods greater than or equal to 30 hours) and the polarization fraction (the degree to which asteroid spin poles align correctly with their position in the family's V-shape distribution according to the Yarkovsky theory). Evolution of both quantities were fitted to identify characteristic transition timescales. We discovered that the slow-rotator fraction increases steeply with $t$ and saturates at $f_{\rm slow} \simeq 0.25$ around a breakpoint $t_{\rm bp} \simeq 20$. This implies a stochastic YORP timescale $\tau_{\rm YORP,stoc} \simeq 10\,\tau_{\rm YORP}$ by comparison with rotational evolution models that include tumbling and weakened YORP torques. The polarization fraction reaches a maximum of $\simeq 0.8$ at $t \simeq 16$ and then decays toward the random limit $f_{\rm pol} \rightarrow 0.5$ for $t \gtrsim 20$, indicating an increasing dominance of collisional spin reorientation over time. The rotation properties within different asteroid families offer crucial clues to rotation evolution and can serve as a new dimension for age estimation of asteroid families with more data in the LSST era.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: Sub-solar C/O ratio and metallicity atmosphere of the misaligned hot Jupiter HAT-P-30b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the misaligned hot Jupiter HAT-P-30b from 2.8--5.2 $\mu$m as part of the BOWIE-ALIGN survey, a comparative survey designed to probe the link between planet formation and atmospheric composition in samples of misaligned and aligned hot Jupiters orbiting F-type stars. Through independent data reductions and retrieval analyses, we find evidence for absorption features of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ in the atmosphere of HAT-P-30b. Our retrieved abundances are consistent with equilibrium chemistry, from which we infer a sub-solar C/O ratio (0.16--0.45), and sub-solar and sub-stellar metallicity (0.2--0.8$\times$solar, compared to a stellar metallicity of 1.1--1.6$\times$solar), with muted spectral features. This composition challenges formation models of continuous migration and accretion within a steady disc of stellar metallicity, and could be the result of low C/O ratio gas accretion within the water ice line, low metallicity accretion due to the trapping of volatiles further out in the disc, or the combined accretion of low metallicity gas and carbon-poor solids.</description>

      <title>Toward Reliable Interpretations of Small Exoplanet Compositions: Comparisons and Considerations of Equations of State and Materials Used in Common Rocky Planet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk compositions of small planets ($R_p&lt; 2 \mathrm{R}_\oplus$) are directly linked to their formation histories, making reliable compositional constraints imperative for testing models of planet formation and evolution. Because exoplanet interiors cannot be directly observed, their make-up must be inferred from mass-radius-composition models that link assumed stellar abundances to the direct observables: planetary mass and radius. There are a variety of such models in the literature, each adopting different equations of state (EOS) to describe the materials' properties at depth and varying assumptions about the minerals present within the planets. These EOS+mineral suites provide the foundations for compositional inferences, but they have not yet been systematically compared. In this work, we review several suites, with a detailed description of the basic structure, mineral physics, and materials within standard small planet models. We show that EOS+mineral suites predict planet densities whose differences are comparable to current observational uncertainties, which present a challenge for robustly interpreting and classifying small planets. We apply a powerful small-planet characterization framework, which illustrates that variations among EOS+mineral suites lead to inconsistent conclusions for both individual planets and sample-level demographics. Our results demonstrate the need for more careful considerations of the materials and EOS used in mass-radius-composition models, especially given the current focus on finding and characterizing potentially habitable rocky planets. We conclude with recommendations for best practices so that future interpretations of small planets and their formation are accurate and consistent.</description>

      <title>Timescales diagnostics for saving viscous and MHD-driven dusty discs from external photoevaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary discs is a function of their internal processes and of their environment. It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modeled via an $\alpha$ parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc's angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.</description>

      <title>A Newly Identified Degeneracy Keeps the Planetary Interpretation Viable for OGLE-2011-BLG-0950</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0950 exhibits the well-known ``Planet/Binary'' degeneracy, in which distinct lens configurations produce similar light curves but imply substantially different mass ratios between the lens components. A previous study suggested that high-resolution imaging could break this degeneracy through differences in the lens-source relative proper motion. In this work, we identify a new planetary model for this event that arises from a newly identified degeneracy, simultaneously reproducing the observed light curve and remaining consistent with the relative proper motion measured from high-resolution imaging. By combining constraints from the light-curve modeling and high-resolution observations, we infer a lens system consisting of a $\sim 1~M_{\odot}$ host star orbited by a $\sim 1.5~M_{\rm Jup}$ planet, with a projected separation of about 2 or 8 au, subject to the ``Close/Wide'' degeneracy. Our reanalysis of the color-magnitude diagram further indicates that the source star has unresolved companions that contribute non-negligible blended light, highlighting the importance of carefully accounting for source and lens companions in future Roman microlensing analyses. Finally, we show that adopting a single mass--luminosity relation significantly underestimates the uncertainties in the inferred lens properties for host masses $\gtrsim 1~M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>The Occurrence Rate of Nearby Planetary Companions to Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the &gt; 500 confirmed transiting hot jupiters and approximately 2000 additional candidates today, only ten are known to have nearby companion planets. The survival of nearby companions means that these hot jupiters cannot have migrated to their present location via dynamically disruptive high-eccentricity migration but instead have undergone disk migration or formed in situ. The occurrence rate for these nearby companions, therefore, constrains the relative efficiency of different hot jupiter formation pathways. Here, we perform a uniform box least-squares search for nearby transiting companions to hot jupiters in the first five years of TESS data. Accounting for observational completeness and detection efficiency, we arrive at an occurrence rate of $(7.6^{+5.5}_{-3.8})\%$, which is a lower limit on the fraction of hot jupiters that underwent disk migration or in situ formation. Comparing this rate with that derived from transit-timing variation searches suggests that hot jupiters are likely mostly aligned with their nearby companions, but their apparently higher incidence of grazing transits may point to a slight preferential misalignment. We also synthesize evidence that hot jupiters with nearby companions may have cold companions at a rate similar to that of other hot jupiters. Comprehensive transit, radial velocity, and stellar obliquity measurements in hot jupiter systems with nearby companions will be necessary to fully account for the relative prevalence of proposed hot jupiter formation pathways.</description>

      <title>The ESA Meerkat Asteroid Guard: a monitoring service for imminent impactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Meerkat Asteroid Guard, an imminent impactor warning service developed and maintained by the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC). The software uses the method of systematic ranging to perform orbit determination on tracklets in the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP), which typically have short observational arcs. Fitted orbits are propagated to determine the likelihood of an impact with Earth. In addition, magnitude fitting and Monte Carlo sampling are performed to estimate the object's size, possible impact locations and times, and suggest a best telescope pointing for object follow-up. A set of object scores are produced from computed posterior probabilities across the grid, giving a statistical description of the object's orbital and physical characteristics. The scores are packaged with several informative plots in an email alert, which is sent to Meerkat subscribers in the event of a significant impact probability, close approach, or other scientifically interesting event. The highlights of the five years of Meerkat's operational service are presented, including the successful warnings for all of the past six imminent impactors discovered before impact and several interesting close approaches.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Can Persist in the Inner Regions of Weakly-Ionized Planet Forming Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks, and the extent to which those mechanisms produce turbulence, is a crucial problem in understanding planet formation. The bulk of the gas in protoplanetary disks is weakly ionized, which leads to the emergence of three non-ideal effects, Ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect. These low-ionization processes can in some cases suppress turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). However, it has recently been shown that these non-ideal terms can also affect the dynamics of the gas in fundamentally different ways than simple diffusion. In order to further study the role of low-ionization on disk gas dynamics, we carry out a 3D local shearing box simulation with both Ohmic diffusion and ambipolar diffusion and an additional simulation with the Hall effect included. The strength of each non-ideal term, when present, is representative of gas at a radius of 5 AU in a realistic protoplanetary disk. We find the Hall effect increases the saturation strength of the magnetic field, but does not necessarily drive turbulence, consistent with previous work. However, interactions between ambipolar diffusion and the Keplerian shear lead to the ambipolar diffusion shear instability (ADSI), which can drive the initial growth, not damping, of magnetic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly demonstrates the viability of the ADSI in the non-linear regime within protoplanetary disks. At later times in the disk, the MRI (reduced in strength by ambipolar-diffusion), may also be present in regions of weak magnetic field between strong concentrations of vertical magnetic flux and sustain turbulence locally in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Four Cold Super-Jupiters Revealed by Extended and Complex Microlensing Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of four microlensing events, KMT-2020-BLG-0202, KMT-2022-BLG-1551, KMT-2023-BLG-0466, and KMT-2025-BLG-0121, which exhibit extended and complex anomalies in their light curves. These events were identified through a systematic reanalysis of KMTNet data aimed at detecting planetary signals that deviate from the typical short-term anomaly morphology. Detailed modeling indicates that all four anomalies were produced by planetary companions to low-mass stellar hosts. The events have mass ratios of $q \sim (5$--$14)\times10^{-3}$ and Einstein timescales of $t_{\rm E} \sim 20$--$43$ days. Bayesian analyses based on Galactic models show that the companions are super-Jupiters with masses of a few to approximately 10 $M_{\rm J}$, orbiting sub-solar-mass hosts located at distances of $D_{\rm L} \sim 4$--$7$~kpc. All planets lie well beyond the snow line of their hosts, placing them in the regime of cold giant planets. These detections demonstrate that extended and complex microlensing anomalies, which are often challenging to recognize as planetary in origin, can nonetheless contain planetary signals. This work underscores the unique sensitivity of microlensing to cold, massive planets beyond the snow line and highlights the importance of systematic reanalyses of survey data for achieving a more complete and unbiased census of exoplanets in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Architectures of Exoplanetary Systems. IV: A Multi-planet Model for Reproducing the Radius Valley and Intra-system Size Similarity of Planets around Kepler's FGK Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kepler-observed distribution of planet sizes have revealed two distinct patterns: (1) a radius valley separating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes and (2) a preference for intra-system size similarity. We present a new model for the exoplanet population observed by Kepler, which is a "hybrid" of a clustered multi-planet model in which the orbital architectures are set by the angular momentum deficit (AMD) stability (He et al. 2020; arXiv:2007.14473) and a joint mass-radius-period model involving envelope mass-loss driven by photoevaporation (Neil &amp; Rogers 2020; arXiv:1911.03582). We find that the models that produce the deepest radius valleys have a primordial population of planets with initial radii peaking at $\sim 2.1 R_\oplus$, which is subsequently sculpted by photoevaporation into a bimodal distribution of final planet radii. The hybrid model requires strongly clustered initial planet masses in order to match the distributions of the size similarity metrics. Thus, the preference for intra-system radius similarity is well explained by a clustering in the primordial mass distribution. The hybrid model also naturally reproduces the observed radius cliff (steep drop-off beyond $\sim 2.5 R_\oplus$). Our hybrid model is the latest installment of the SysSim forward models, and is the first multi-planet model capable of simultaneously reproducing the observed radius valley and the intra-system size similarity patterns. We compute occurrence rates and fractions of stars with planets for a variety of planet types, and find that the occurrence of Venus and Earth-like planets drops by a factor of $\sim 2$-4 for the hybrid models compared to previous clustered models in which there is no envelope mass-loss.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Origin of (469219) Kamo`oalewa of Tianwen-2 Mission from the Main-Belt: $\nu_6$ Secular Resonance, Flora Family or 3:1 Resonance with Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: China's Tianwen-2 mission, launched on 29 May 2025, targets the near-Earth object (469219) Kamo`oalewa, an Earth quasi-satellite trapped in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with our planet. Determining the origin of Kamo`oalewa is central to understanding the formation pathways and dynamical evolution of Earth's quasi-satellite population. Here we show a strong possibility of main-belt origin for Kamo`oalewa using long-term dynamical simulations. We examine three candidate source regions: the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\nu_6$), the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter (3:1J MMR), and the Flora family. A total of 42,825 test particles were integrated over 100 Myr. We find that asteroids from all three regions can be transported onto Kamo`oalewa-like orbits, albeit with markedly different efficiencies. Particles originating near the $\nu_6$ show the highest transfer probability (3.31%), followed by the Flora family (2.54%) and the 3:1J MMR (0.39%). We further identify representative dynamical pathways linking these source regions to Earth quasi-satellite orbits. The Tianwen-2 spacecraft is expected to rendezvous with Kamo`oalewa in 2026, performing close-proximity operations and returning samples. The mission will provide decisive observational constraints on the asteroid's composition and physical properties, offering a critical test of its proposed origin.</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) II. The radial structure of debris discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) was recently completed to cover the lack of high-resolution observations of debris discs and to investigate the prevalence of substructures such as radial gaps and rings in a sample of 24 discs. This study characterises the radial structure of debris discs in the ARKS programme. To identify and quantify the disc substructures, we modelled all discs with a range of non-parametric and parametric approaches. We find that of the 24 discs in the sample, 5 host multiple rings, 7 are single rings that display halos or additional low-amplitude rings, and 12 are single rings with at most tentative evidence of additional substructures. The fractional ring widths that we measured are significantly narrower than previously derived values, and they follow a distribution similar to the fractional widths of individual rings resolved in protoplanetary discs. However, there exists a population of rings in debris discs that are significantly wider than those in protoplanetary discs. We also find that discs with steep inner edges consistent with planet sculpting tend to be found at smaller (&lt;100 au) radii, while more radially extended discs tend to have shallower edges more consistent with collisional evolution. An overwhelming majority of discs have radial profiles well-described by either a double power law or double-Gaussian parametrisation. While our findings suggest that it may be possible for some debris discs to inherit their structures directly from protoplanetary discs, there exists a sizeable population of broad debris discs that cannot be explained in this way. Assuming that the distribution of millimetre dust reflects the distribution of planetesimals, mechanisms that cause rings in protoplanetary discs to migrate or debris discs to broaden soon after formation may be at play, possibly mediated by planetary migration or scattering.</description>

      <title>Primitive asteroids in the main belt, Cybele, and Hilda populations from Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primitive asteroids include C-, P-, and D-classes, known to be dark and having spectra mostly featureless. They differ in the spectral slope, which ranges from moderate values for C-types, and progressively increases in P- and D-types, the latter being the reddest. While C- and P-types are commonly observed in the asteroid main belt, D-types are commonly found further from the Sun, in the Cybele, Hilda, and Jupiter Trojans regions, and very few are reported in the main belt. This study aims at characterizing the abundance of primordial and red asteroids, belonging to the P-, D-, and Z-classes in the Mahlke et al. (2022) taxonomy, in the 2-5.2 AU region using the third data release by the Gaia mission spectral catalog, which includes more than 60000 spectrophotometric data of asteroids. We have applied the following methodology to identify primordial asteroids in the catalog: 1) selection of objects with signal to noise ratio greater than 20; 2) albedo value less than 12%; 3) chi-squared fit to automatically identify potential D-, Z-, and P-types using Bus-DeMeo and Mahlke taxonomy; 4) visual inspection of every spectrum to confirm the taxonomic classification. Referring to Mahlke taxonomy, we have found 318 new D-types across the main belt, as well as 124 Z-types, and is in agreement with theoretical estimations. We computed the spectral slope in the visible range (0.55 - 0.81 \mu m). We also have identified 265 P-types in the main belt. For the Cybele and Hilda asteroids, we characterize the taxonomic class of all the bodies with SNR higher than 20 in the Gaia catalog, for a total sample of 193 and 180 asteroids, respectively.</description>

      <title>Discovery and characterisation of two exoplanets orbiting the metal-poor, solar-type star TOI-5788 with TESS, CHEOPS, and HARPS-N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and characterisation of two transiting exoplanets orbiting the metal-poor, solar-type star TOI-5788. From our analysis of six \textit{TESS} sectors and a dedicated \textit{CHEOPS} programme, we identify an inner planet (TOI-5788~b; $P = 6.340758\pm0.000030\,\si{\day}$) with radius $1.528\pm0.075\,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ and an outer planet (TOI-5788~c; $P = 16.213362\pm0.000026\,\si{\day}$) with radius $2.272\pm0.039\,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$. We obtained 125 radial-velocity spectra from HARPS-N and constrain the masses of TOI-5788~b and~c as $3.72\pm0.94\,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ and $6.4\pm1.2\,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$, respectively. Although dynamical analyses indicate that a third planet could exist in a stable orbit between 8 and 14 days, we find no evidence of additional planets. Since the TOI-5788 system is one of the few systems with planets straddling the radius gap, and noting that there are even fewer such systems around metal poor stars, it is a promising system to constrain planet formation theories. We therefore model the interior structures of both planets. We find that TOI-5788~b is consistent with being a rocky planet with almost no envelope, or having an atmosphere of a high mean molecular weight. We find that TOI-5788~c is consistent with both gas-dwarf and water-world hypotheses of mini-Neptune formation. We model the atmospheric evolution history of both planets. Whilst both scenarios are consistent with the atmospheric evolution of TOI-5788~c, the gas-dwarf model is marginally preferred. The results of the atmospheric evolution analysis are not strongly dependent on stellar evolution. This makes the system a promising target to test internal structure and atmospheric evolution models.</description>

      <title>RV$\times$TESS I: Modeling Asteroseismic Signals with Simultaneous Photometry and RVs</title>

Abstract: Detecting small planets via the radial velocity method remains challenged by signals induced by stellar variability, versus the effects of the planet(s). Here, we explore using Gaussian Process (GP) regression with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry in modeling radial velocities (RVs) to help to mitigate stellar jitter from oscillations and granulation for exoplanet detection. We applied GP regression to simultaneous TESS photometric and RV data of HD 5562, a G-type subgiant ($M_\star=1.09M_{\odot}$, $R_\star=1.88R_{\odot}$) with a V magnitude of 7.17, using photometry to inform the priors for RV fitting. The RV data is obtained by the Magellan Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS). The photometry-informed GP regression reduced the RV scatter of HD~5562 from 2.03 to 0.51 m/s. We performed injection and recovery tests to evaluate the potential of GPs for discovering small exoplanets around evolved stars, which demonstrate that the GP provides comparable noise reduction to the binning method. We also found that the necessity of photometric data depends on the quality of the RV dataset. For long baseline and high-cadence RV observations, GP regression can effectively mitigate stellar jitter without photometric data. However, for intermittent RV observations, incorporating photometric data improves GP fitting and enhances detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Pre-computed aerosol extinction, scattering and asymmetry grids for scalable atmospheric retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented wavelength coverage and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) permits to measure the absorption features of a wide range of condensate species from Silicates to Titan tholins. Atmospheric retrievals are uniquely suited to analyse these datasets and characterize the aerosols present in exoplanet atmospheres. However, including the optical properties of condensed particles within retrieval frameworks remains computationally expensive, limiting our ability to fully exploit JWST observations. In this work, we improve the computational efficiency and scaling behavior of aerosol models in atmospheric retrievals, enabling in-depth studies including multiple condensate species within practical time scales. Rather than computing the aerosol Mie coefficients for each sampled model, we pre-compute extinction efficiency (Qext), scattering efficiency (Qscat) and asymmetry parameter (g) grids for seven condensate species relevant in exoplanet atmospheres (Mg2SiO4 amorph sol - gel, MgSiO3 amorph glass, MgSiO3 amorph sol - gel, SiO2 alpha, SiO2 amorph, SiO and Titan tholins). The pre-computed Qext grids significantly reduce computation time between 1.4 and 17 times with negligible differences on the retrieved parameters. They also scale effortlessly with the number of aerosol species while maintaining the accuracy of cloud models. Thereby enabling more complex retrievals as well as broader population studies without increasing the overall error budget. The Qext, Qscat and g grids are freely available on Zenodo as well as a public TauREx plugin -TauREx-PCQ- that utilize them.</description>

      <title>The PAIRS project: a global formation model for planets in binaries. I. Effect of disc truncation on the growth of S-type planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars are as common as single stars. The number of detected planets orbiting binaries is rapidly increasing thanks to the synergy between transit surveys, Gaia and high-resolution direct imaging campaigns. However, global planet formation models around binary stars are still underdeveloped, which limits the theoretical understanding of planets orbiting binary star systems. Hereby we introduce the PAIRS project, which aims at building a global planet formation model for planets in binaries, and to produce planet populations synthesis to statistically compare theory and observations. In this first paper, we present the adaptation of the circumstellar disc to simulate the formation of S-type planets. The presence of a secondary star tidally truncates and heats the outer part of the circumprimary disc (and vice-versa for the circumsecondary disc), limiting the material to form planets. We implement and quantify this effect for a range of binary parameters by adapting the Bern Model of planet formation in its pebble-based form and for in-situ planet growth. We find that the disc truncation has a strong impact on reducing the pebble supply for core growth, steadily suppressing planet formation for binary separations below 160 au, when considering all the formed planets more massive than Mars. We find as well that S-type planets tend to form close to the central star with respect to the binary separation and disc truncation radius. Our newly developed model will be the basis of future S-type planet population synthesis studies.</description>

      <title>The PAIRS project: a global formation model for planets in binaries. II. Gravitational perturbation effects from secondary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roughly half of Sun-like stars have at least one stellar companion, whereas it is widely assumed that most known exoplanets orbit single stars, largely due to observational biases. However, astrometric surveys, direct imaging, and speckle interferometry are steadily increasing the number of confirmed exoplanets in binaries. A stellar companion introduces additional effects, such as circumstellar disk truncation and gravitational perturbations, which can strongly impact planet formation. While global planet formation models, for example the Bern model, have been broadly applied to single stars, modeling S-type binaries requires key modifications to capture these effects. This study extends the Bern model by incorporating the gravitational influence of a stellar companion into its N-body integrator, allowing us to quantify how this perturbation affects planetary formation and final system architecture across a range of binary configurations. By comparing binary and single-star systems under identical initial conditions, we can assess the specific impact of binary-induced dynamics. We ran three sets of simulations: (i) a grid of in situ single-embryo cases to quantify gravitational effects; (ii) formation simulations with and without migration to compare outcomes with single-star analogs; and (iii) multi-embryo runs to evaluate impacts on multi-planetary systems. Planets forming beyond half the host star's Hill radius are much more likely to become unbound especially in systems with high binary eccentricity. Even within stable zones, growth is suppressed by both reduced material availability and increased eccentricity from stellar perturbations. Both disk truncation and stellar perturbations must be included to model planet formation in S-type binaries accurately. Neglecting either one will end up misrepresenting planetary growth and survival.</description>

      <title>Using observations of escaping H/He to constrain the atmospheric composition of sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal composition of sub-Neptunes remains a prominent unresolved question in exoplanetary science. We present a technique to place constraints on envelope mean molecular weight that utilises observations of escaping hydrogen or helium exospheres. This method is based on a simple timescale argument, which states that sub-Neptunes require a sufficiently large hydrogen or helium reservoir to explain on-going escape at their observed rates. This then naturally leads to an upper limit on atmospheric mean molecular weight. We apply this technique to archetypal sub-Neptunes, namely GJ-436 b, TOI-776 b and TOI-776 c, which have all been observed to be losing significant hydrogen content as well as relatively featureless transit spectra when observed with JWST. Combining constraints from atmospheric escape and transit spectroscopy in the case of TOI-776 c allows us to tentatively rule out the high mean molecular weight scenario, pointing towards a low mean molecular weight atmosphere with high-altitude aerosols muting spectral features in the infra-red. Finally, we reframe our analysis to the hycean candidate K2-18 b, which has also been shown to host a tentative escaping hydrogen exosphere. If such a detection is robust, we infer a hydrogen-rich envelope mass fraction of $\log f_\text{env} = -1.67\pm0.78$, which is inconsistent with the hycean scenario at the $\sim 4\sigma$ level. This latter result requires further observational follow-up to confirm.</description>

Abstract: Direct observations of exoplanets probe the demographics and atmospheric composition of young self-luminous companions, yielding insight into their formation and early evolution history. In the near future, Gaia will reveal hundreds of nearby young exoplanets amenable to direct follow-up observations. Long-baseline interferometry with current and future facilities is best capable of exploiting this unique synergy which is poised to deliver a statistical sample of benchmark planets with precise dynamical masses and in-depth atmospheric characterization. This will enable tackling the longstanding question of how giant planets form from multiple angles simultaneously, shining light on the complex physical processes underlying planet formation.</description>

      <title>Using Astrometry to Break Degeneracies in Stellar Surface Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric jitter noise arises when starspots on a rotating stellar surface move in and out of view, shifting the photocenter. This noise may limit our ability to detect and weigh small, sub-Neptune-sized planets around active stars. By deriving a linear forward model for the astrometric jitter signal of a rotating star in a spherical-harmonic coordinate system, we show that jitter noise can be used to reconstruct surface-brightness maps and, in principle, disentangle jitter from stellar reflex motion due to an orbiting planet. Furthermore, we show that astrometry and photometry probe complementary surface information: photometry measures even-degree spherical harmonic surfaces that are symmetric about the equator, while astrometry measures odd-degree modes. Their joint use, therefore, breaks degeneracies in surface mapping. Our model further quantifies the variation in the astrometric signal with inclination angle, which is foundational for studies of worst-case configurations of astrometric star-spot noise. For example, we show that pole-on stellar inclinations lead to poorly constrained inversions, as any stellar surface produces a purely circular astrometric jitter signal. We characterize the degeneracy in jointly identifying the stellar surface and stellar inclination, and develop a surface estimation approach. Using this approach, we present example simulations and reconstructions that demonstrate the use of astrometry data alongside light-curve data to improve stellar surface mapping and localize spot positions in latitude and longitude. With forthcoming high-precision Gaia astrometry, astrometric surface mapping provides a promising new approach to probe stellar activity.</description>

      <title>Clouds and Chemistry Across the Brown Dwarf T-Y Sequence: Insights from JWST Atmospheric Retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers exceptional spectral resolution and wavelength coverage, which are essential for studying the coldest brown dwarfs, particularly Y dwarfs. These objects are at the cold end of the sub-stellar sequence and exhibit atmospheric phenomena such as cloud formation, chemical disequilibrium, and radiative-convective coupling. We examine a curated sample of 22 late-T to Y dwarfs through Bayesian atmospheric retrieval (nested sampling) and supervised machine learning (random forests). Bayesian model comparison indicates that cloud-free models are generally favored for the hottest objects in the sample (T6-T8). Conversely, later-type dwarfs exhibit varying preferences, with both gray-cloud and cloud-free models providing comparable fits. The atmospheric parameters retrieved are consistent across the applied methodologies. Evidence of vertical mixing and disequilibrium chemistry is found in several objects; notably, the Y1 dwarf WISEPAJ1541-22 favors a gray cloud model and shows elevated abundances of both CO and CO2 compared to equilibrium chemistry calculations. As anticipated, the abundances of H2O, CH4, and NH3 increase with decreasing effective temperature over the T-Y sequence.</description>

      <title>PyIRD: A Python-Based Data Reduction Pipeline for Subaru/IRD and REACH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PyIRD is a Python-based pipeline for reducing spectroscopic data obtained with IRD (InfraRed Doppler; Kotani et al. (2018)) and REACH (Rigorous Exoplanetary Atmosphere Characterization with High dispersion coronagraphy; Kotani et al. (2020)) on the Subaru Telescope. It is designed to process raw images into one-dimensional spectra in a semi-automatic manner. Unlike traditional methods, it does not rely on IRAF (Tody, 1986; 1993), a software used for astronomical data reduction. This approach simplifies the workflow while maintaining efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the pipeline includes an updated method for removing readout noise patterns from raw images, enabling efficient extraction of spectra even for faint targets such as brown dwarfs.

Understanding the survival and orbital evolution of brown dwarf (BD) companions during the post-main-sequence (MS) evolution of their host stars is increasingly important, especially with recent discoveries of many substellar companions around white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. We investigate the long-term evolution and final outcomes of BDs orbiting low-mass MS stars as these evolve into WDs. By comparing forward-modeling populations with observed WD-BD binaries, we test evolutionary models and predict the existence of yet-undetected systems. Methods. We employ the COMPAS binary population synthesis code to evolve observed MS-BD systems through the post-MS phases of their host stars into the WD stage, tracking orbital changes driven by mass loss, tides, and common-envelope (CE) evolution. Results. Our simulations reproduce a period gap in the distribution of detached WD-BD binaries, consistent with observations. We also identify a boundary separating detached and semi-detached systems on the period-mass diagram, located at orbital periods of $\sim$1-2 hours depending on the BD mass. Conclusions. We predict that a subset of currently known MS-BD binaries will survive post-MS evolution and emerge as detached WD-BD systems, while others will undergo CE evolution and potentially form cataclysmic variables with BD donors. Our results reproduce the observed period gap in WD-BD binaries and provide quantitative predictions for the role of CE efficiency in shaping their distribution. This work predicts that many WD-BD systems remain undetected, motivating targeted searches with microlensing and high-contrast imaging techniques using next-generation large telescopes.</description>

      <title>On the importance of geometry in exoplanet irradiation : Implications for the day-night contrast</title>

Abstract: The irradiance received by a spherical body or a planet close to a spherically symmetric source does not follow the point-sized source approximation and the inverse-square variation of irradiation if spherical symmetry is broken. In the penumbral zones of the planet, spherical symmetry of the star reduces to an axial symmetry. Our work aims to put forward a fundamental explanation, using energy conservation, to determine the variation of irradiance in the penumbral zone on a close-in planet where the point-sized source approximation fails. Consequently, we propose a numerical model that accurately predicts the irradiance within the boundaries of the penumbral zone and the fully-illuminated zone. Our analysis also corrects a previous study on exoplanet irradiation that violates energy conservation. We find that night-side illumination partially explains the observed night-side temperatures on the planets considered; this reduces reliance on heat transport models to explain the night-side temperature for the few exemplar rocky close-in planets, namely K2-141 b, 55 Cancri e, TOI-561 b, TOI-431 b, and Kepler-10 b, that are discussed in this work. We provide improved day-night contrast temperatures, considering an airless scenario, and highlight the need for revisiting the heat transport models associated with atmospheric modelling of planets where the night-side illumination is significant.</description>

      <title>Is the high-energy environment of K2-18b special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photoevaporative mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observation we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Historical Surveys to Rubin First Look: Absolute Colors of trans-Neptunian objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric study of transNeptunian objects (TNOs) by combining data from SDSS, Col-OSSOS, DES, and the recent Rubin First Look (RFL) data. Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects.
  From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits.
  Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey.
  We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.</description>

      <title>JWST COMPASS: Insights into the Systematic Noise Properties of NIRSpec/G395H From a Uniform Reanalysis of Seven Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has already observed near-infrared transmission spectra of over a dozen super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While some observations have allowed astronomers to characterize sub-Neptunes in unprecedented detail, small feature amplitudes and poorly-understood systematics have led to ambiguous results for others. Using the first seven targets from the COMPASS program, which is currently surveying 12 small planet atmospheres using NIRSpec/G395H, we investigate these timeseries systematics. We implement a model that uses the principle components of the normalized pixel fluxes to account for variations in the shape and position of the spectral trace. We find that observations with a smaller number of groups-per-integration benefit most profoundly from the use of this model, and that systematics are particularly strong between 2.8 and 3.5 $\mu$m. Despite these systematics, \texttt{pandexo} is a relatively accurate predictor of the precision of the spectra, with real error bars on average 5\% larger in NRS1 and 12\% larger in NRS2 than predicted. We compute new limits on metallicity and opaque pressure level for each target and compare these to previous results from the COMPASS program. Next, we co-add spectra from multiple targets to reduce the effective noise in the combined spectra in hopes of detecting transmission features in common between the targets, but this exercise does not yield compelling evidence any signals. We find that a handful of additional transits are sufficient to break the degeneracy between metallicity and aerosols for the majority of our targets, pointing towards the possibility of unraveling the mysteries of these worlds with future allocations of JWST time.</description>

      <title>The impact of disc photoevaporation on the long-term evolution of giant planets in mean motion resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the long-term impact of disc photoevaporation on the dynamical stability and evolution of giant planet pairs in mean motion resonances. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, in which we have included mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we explore a parameter space covering disc mass, viscosity, planet mass, and resonance type. We find that strong photoevaporation depletes gas in the common gap between the planets, slowing migration and suppressing planet-disc interactions that typically lead to resonance breaking and eccentricity damping. This stabilising effect is most significant for 3:2 resonances, which are more prone to disruption due to the reduced planet spacing. In contrast, 2:1 resonances are generally more robust but can still be destabilised at high disc mass and moderate-to-strong photoevaporation due to asymmetric torques. Photoevaporation can therefore stabilise resonances that would otherwise break, or conversely disrupt resonances that are natively more stable. Even in cases where photoevaporation does not directly affect resonance stability, it typically results in increased planetary eccentricities. These results highlight the complex, system-dependent nature of resonance evolution, with implications for the final orbital architectures of giant planet systems and their detectability via astrometry from missions such as Gaia.</description>

      <title>Cosmoglobe DR2. III. Improved modelling of zodiacal light with COBE-DIRBE through global Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved zodiacal light (ZL) model for COBE-DIRBE derived through global Bayesian analysis within the Cosmoglobe Data Release 2 framework. The parametric form of the ZL model is inspired by the original DIRBE model by Kelsall et al. (K98), but the specific best-fit parameter values are re-derived using the combination of DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations, Planck HFI sky maps, and WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. Furthermore, the ZL parameters are fitted jointly with astrophysical parameters, such as thermal dust and starlight emission, and the new model takes into account excess radiation that appears stationary in solar-centric coordinates as reported in a companion paper. The relative differences between the predicted signals from K98 and our new model are $\lesssim 3\%$ in the 12 and 25 $\mu$m channels over the full sky. The zero-levels of the cleaned DR2 maps are lower than those of the K98 ZL Subtracted Mission Average maps by $\sim 30$ kJy/sr at 1.25--3.5 $\mu$m, which is larger than the entire predicted contribution from high-redshift galaxies to the Cosmic Infrared Background at the same wavelengths. At high Galactic latitudes, the total RMS of each DR2 map is lower than the corresponding DIRBE ZSMA map of $\sim$ 80 \% at wavelengths 4.9--25 $\mu\mathrm{m}$. Still, obvious ZL residuals can be seen in several of the DR2 maps, and further work is required to mitigate these. Joint analysis with high-resolution full-sky surveys such as AKARI, IRAS, Planck HFI, and SPHEREx will be essential both to break key degeneracies in the current model and to determine whether the reported solar-centric excess radiation has a ZL or instrumental origin. Thus, while the results presented in this paper do redefine the state-of-the-art for DIRBE modelling, it also only represents the first among many steps toward a future optimal Bayesian ZL model.
