      <title>Closed Orbits of Dynamically Convex Reeb Flows: Towards the HZ- and Multiplicity Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multiplicity problem for prime closed orbits of dynamically convex Reeb flows on the boundary of a star-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. The first of our two main results asserts that such a flow has at least $n$ prime closed Reeb orbits, improving the previously known lower bound by a factor of two and settling a long-standing open question. The second main theorem is that when, in addition, the domain is centrally symmetric and the Reeb flow is non-degenerate, the flow has either exactly $n$ or infinitely many prime closed orbits. This is a higher-dimensional contact variant of Franks' celebrated $2$-or-infinity theorem and, viewed from the symplectic dynamics perspective, settles a particular case of the contact Hofer-Zehnder conjecture. The proofs are based on several auxiliary results of independent interest on the structure of the filtered symplectic homology and the properties of closed orbits.</description>

      <title>Positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of convex domains, higher capacities, and Clarke's duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of a convex domain is naturally isomorphic to the singular ($S^1$-equivariant) homology of Clarke's dual associated with the convex domain. As a result, we prove that the Gutt-Hutchings capacities coincide with the spectral invariants introduced by Ekeland-Hofer for convex domains. From this identification, it follows that Besse convex contact spheres can be characterized by the Gutt-Hutchings capacities, which implies that symplectomorphisms of the interiors of Besse convex bodies encode information about the Reeb flow on their boundaries. Moreover, as a corollary of the aforementioned isomorphism, we deduce that the barcode entropy associated with the singular homology of Clarke's dual provides a lower bound for the topological entropy of the Reeb flow on the boundary of a convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. In particular, this barcode entropy coincides with the topological entropy for convex domains in $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type by Miyaoka (1977) and Yau (1978). Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian surplusection phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose you have a family of Lagrangian submanifolds \(L_t\) and an auxiliary Lagrangian \(K\). Suppose that \(K\) intersects some of the \(L_t\) more than the minimal number of times. Can you eliminate surplus intersection (surplusection) with all fibres by performing a Hamiltonian isotopy of \(K\)? Or will any Lagrangian isotopic to \(K\) surplusect some of the fibres? We argue that in several important situations, surplusection cannot be eliminated, and that a better understanding of surplusection phenomena (better bounds and a clearer understanding of how the surplusection is distributed in the family) would help to tackle some outstanding problems in different areas, including Oh's conjecture on the volume-minimising property of the Clifford torus and the concurrent normals conjecture in convex geometry. We pose many open questions.</description>
