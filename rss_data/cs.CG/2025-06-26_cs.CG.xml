      <title>On the Stability of the Euler Characteristic Transform for a Perturbed Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT) is a robust method for shape classification. It takes an embedded shape and, for each direction, computes a piecewise constant function representing the Euler Characteristic of the shape's sublevel sets, which are defined by the height function in that direction. It has applications in TDA inverse problems, such as shape reconstruction, and is also employed with machine learning methodologies. In this paper, we define a distance between the ECTs of two distinct geometric embeddings of the same abstract simplicial complex and provide an upper bound for this distance. The Super Lifted Euler Characteristic Transform (SELECT), a related construction, extends the ECT to scalar fields defined on shapes. We establish a similar distance bound for SELECT, specifically when applied to fields defined on embedded simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>On plane cycles in geometric multipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric graph is a drawing of a graph in the plane where the vertices are drawn as points in general position and the edges as straight-line segments connecting their endpoints. It is plane if it contains no crossing edges. We study plane cycles in geometric complete multipartite graphs. We prove that if a geometric complete multipartite graph contains a plane cycle of length $t$, with $t \geq 6$, it also contains a smaller plane cycle of length at least $\lfloor t/2\rfloor + 1$. We further give a characterization of geometric complete multipartite graphs that contain plane cycles with a color class appearing at least twice. For geometric drawings of $K_{n,n}$, we give a sufficient condition under which they have, for each $s \leq n$, a plane cycle of length 2s. We also provide an algorithm to decide whether a given geometric drawing of $K_{n,n}$ contains a plane Hamiltonian cycle in time $O(n \log n + nk^2) + O(k^{5k})$, where k is the number of vertices inside the convex hull of all vertices. Finally, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide if a subset of edges of a geometric complete bipartite graph H is contained in a plane Hamiltonian cycle in H.</description>

      <title>Line Aspect Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of covering a target segment $\overline{uv}$ using a finite set of guards $\mathcal{S}$ placed on a source segment $\overline{xy}$ within a simple polygon $\mathcal{P}$, assuming weak visibility between the target and source. Without geometric constraints, $\mathcal{S}$ may be infinite, as shown by prior hardness results. To overcome this, we introduce the {\it line aspect ratio} (AR), defined as the ratio of the \emph{long width} (LW) to the \emph{short width} (SW) of $\mathcal{P}$. These widths are determined by parallel lines tangent to convex vertices outside $\mathcal{P}$ (LW) and reflex vertices inside $\mathcal{P}$ (SW), respectively.
  Under the assumption that AR is constant or polynomial in $n$ (the polygon's complexity), we prove that a finite guard set $\mathcal{S}$ always exists, with size bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\text{AR})$. This AR-based framework generalizes some previous assumptions, encompassing a broader class of polygons.
  Our result establishes a framework guaranteeing finite solutions for segment guarding under practical and intuitive geometric constraints.</description>

      <title>The Contiguous Art Gallery Problem is Solvable in Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Contiguous Art Gallery Problem, introduced by Thomas C. Shermer at the 2024 Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry, a variant of the classical art gallery problem from 1973 by Victor Klee. In the contiguous variant, the input is a simple polygon $P$, and the goal is to partition the boundary into a minimum number of polygonal chains such that each chain is visible to a guard. We present a polynomial-time real RAM algorithm, which solves the contiguous art gallery problem. Our algorithm is simple and practical, and we make a C++ implementation available.
  In contrast, many variations of the art gallery problem are at least NP-hard, making the contiguous variant stand out. These include the edge-covering problem, proven NP-hard by Laurentini [The Visual Computer 1999], and the classical art gallery problem, recently shown $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete by Abrahamsen, Adamaszek, and Miltzow [J. ACM 2022]. Our algorithm is a greedy algorithm that repeatedly traverses the polygon's boundary. To find an optimal solution, we show that it is sufficient to traverse the polygon polynomially many times, resulting in a runtime of $\mathcal{O}\!\left( n^7 \log n \right)$. Additionally, we provide algorithms for the restricted settings, where either the endpoints of the polygonal chains or the guards must coincide with the vertices of the polygon.</description>

      <title>The CompGIT package: a computational tool for Geometric Invariant Theory quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe CompGIT, a SageMath package to describe Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) quotients of projective space by simple groups. The implementation is based on algorithms described by Gallardo--Martinez-Garcia--Moon--Swinarski. In principle the package is sufficient to describe any GIT quotient of a projective variety by a simple group -- in practice it requires that the user can construct an equivariant embedding of the polarised variety into projective space. The package describes the non-stable and unstable loci up to conjugation by the group, as well as describing the strictly polystable loci. We discuss potential applications of the outputs of CompGIT to algebraic geometry problems, a well as suggesting directions for future developments.</description>
