      <title>Weakly-Constrained 4D Var for Downscaling with Uncertainty using Data-Driven Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic downscaling typically involves using numerical weather prediction (NWP) solvers to refine coarse data to higher spatial resolutions. Data-driven models such as FourCastNet have emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional NWP models for forecasting. Once these models are trained, they are capable of delivering forecasts in a few seconds, thousands of times faster compared to classical NWP models. However, as the lead times, and, therefore, their forecast window, increase, these models show instability in that they tend to diverge from reality. In this paper, we propose to use data assimilation approaches to stabilize them when used for downscaling tasks. Data assimilation uses information from three different sources, namely an imperfect computational model based on partial differential equations (PDE), from noisy observations, and from an uncertainty-reflecting prior. In this work, when carrying out dynamic downscaling, we replace the computationally expensive PDE-based NWP models with FourCastNet in a ``weak-constrained 4DVar framework" that accounts for the implied model errors. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for a hurricane-tracking problem; moreover, the 4DVar framework naturally allows the expression and quantification of uncertainty. We demonstrate, using ERA5 data, that our approach performs better than the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the unstabilized FourCastNet model, both in terms of forecast accuracy and forecast uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Improving Oil Slick Trajectory Simulations with Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of oil spill trajectories are essential for supporting practitioners' response and mitigating environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Numerical models, such as MEDSLIK-II, simulate advection, dispersion, and transformation processes of oil particles. However, simulations heavily rely on accurate parameter tuning, still based on expert knowledge and manual calibration. To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over 12,000 $m^3$ of oil. We show that, on average, the proposed approach systematically improves the FSS from 5.82% to 11.07% compared to control simulations initialized with default parameters. The optimization results in consistent improvement across multiple time steps, particularly during periods of increased drift variability, demonstrating the robustness of our method in dynamic environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Using Unstable Periodic Orbits to Understand Blocking Behaviour in a Low Order Land-Atmosphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) were used to identify regimes, and transitions between regimes, in a reduced-order coupled atmosphere-land spectral model. In this paper we describe how the chaotic attractor of this model was clustered using the numerically derived set of UPOs. Using continuation software, the origin of these clusters were also investigated. The flow of model trajectories can be approximated using UPOs, a concept known as shadowing. Here we extend that idea to look at the number of times a UPO shadows a model trajectory over a fixed time period, which we call cumulative shadowing. This concept was used to identify sets of UPOs that describe different life cycles of each cluster. The different regions of the attractor that were identified in the current work, and the transitions between these regions, are linked to specific atmospheric features known as atmospheric blocks.</description>
