      <title>Improving topological cluster reconstruction using calorimeter cell timing in ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clusters of topologically connected calorimeter cells around cells with large absolute signal-to-noise ratio (topo-clusters) are the basis for calorimeter signal reconstruction in the ATLAS experiment. Topological cell clustering has proven performant in LHC Runs 1 and 2. It is, however, susceptible to out-of-time pile-up of signals from soft collisions outside the 25 ns proton-bunch-crossing window associated with the event's hard collision. To reduce this effect, a calorimeter-cell timing criterion was added to the signal-to-noise ratio requirement in the clustering algorithm. Multiple versions of this criterion were tested by reconstructing hadronic signals in simulated events and Run 2 ATLAS data. The preferred version is found to reduce the out-of-time pile-up jet multiplicity by $\sim$50% for jet $p_\text{T}\sim 20$ GeV and by $\sim$80% for jet $p_\text{T} \gtrsim 50$ GeV, while not disrupting the reconstruction of hadronic signals of interest, and improving the jet energy resolution by up to 5% for $20 &lt; p_\text{T} &lt; 30$ GeV. Pile-up is also suppressed for other physics objects based on topo-clusters (electrons, photons, $\tau$-leptons), reducing the overall event size on disk by about 6% in early Run 3 pile-up conditions. Offline reconstruction for Run 3 includes the timing requirement.</description>

      <title>High-finesse nanofiber Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator in a portable storage container</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present characterization and storage methods for a high-finesse nanofiber Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator. Reflection spectroscopy from both ends of the resonator allows for evaluation of the mirror transmittances and optical loss inside the resonator. To maintain the quality of the nanofiber resonator after the fabrication, we have developed a portable storage container. By filling the container with dry, clean nitrogen gas, we can prevent contamination of the nanofiber during storage. This approach allows us to minimize the additional optical loss to less than 0.08% over a week. The portable container facilitates both the fabrication and subsequent experimentation with the resonator in different locations. This flexibility expands the range of applications, including quantum optics, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties from metrology in the integrated luminosity measurement with the updated design of a detector at CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to measure integrated luminosity with a required precision of $10^{-4}$ at the $Z^0$ pole, proposed CEPC $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider requires a luminometer, a specially designed calorimeter placed in the very forward region to identify Bhabha scattering at low polar angles. Usually, such a device is placed at the outgoing beams, to keep the spatial symmetries of the head-on collisions at accelerators with a non-zero crossing angle. At CEPC it is currently proposed to place the luminometer on the z-axis. We review a feasibility of a measurement of the integrated luminosity at the $Z^{0}$ pole with the required precision, concerning the luminometer centered around the z-axis and the post-CDR beam properties.</description>
