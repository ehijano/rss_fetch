      <title>Inverse Design of an All-Dielectric Nonlinear Polaritonic Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces offer a new paradigm to realize optical nonlinear devices with new and unparalleled behavior compared to nonlinear crystals, due to the interplay between photonic resonances and materials properties. The complicated interdependency between efficiency and emission directionality of the nonlinear optical signal on the existence, localization, and lifetimes of photonic resonances, as well as on the nonlinear susceptibility, makes it extremely difficult to design optimal metasurfaces using conventional materials and geometries. Inverse design using topology optimization is a powerful design tool for photonic structures, but traditional approaches developed for linear photonics are not suitable for such high dimensional nonlinear problems. Here, we use a topology optimization approach to inverse-design a fabrication-robust nonlinear metasurface that includes quantum-engineered resonant nonlinearities in semiconductor heterostructures for efficient and directional second harmonic generation. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that under practical constraints, among all the parameters, the nonlinear modal overlap emerges as the dominant parameter that enhances conversion efficiency, a finding that contrasts with intuition-driven studies that often emphasize Purcell enhancement. Our results open new opportunities for optimizing nonlinear processes in nanophotonic structures for novel light sources, quantum information applications, and communication.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Unitary Transmission Matrices in Silicon Photonic Coupled Waveguide Arrays using a Neural Adjoint Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of low-loss reconfigurable integrated optical devices enables further research into technologies including photonic signal processing, analogue quantum computing, and optical neural networks. Here, we introduce digital patterning of coupled waveguide arrays as a platform capable of implementing unitary matrix operations. Determining the required device geometry for a specific optical output is computationally challenging and requires a robust and versatile inverse design protocol. In this work we present an approach using high speed neural network surrogate based gradient optimization, capable of predicting patterns of refractive index perturbations based on switching of the ultra-low loss chalcogenide phase change material, antimony tri-selinide ($\text{Sb}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$). Results for a $3 \times 3$ silicon waveguide array are presented, demonstrating control of both amplitude and phase for each transmission matrix element. Network performance is studied using neural network optimization tools such as dataset augmentation and supplementation with random noise, resulting in an average fidelity of 0.94 for unitary matrix targets. Our results show that coupled waveguide arrays with perturbation patterns offer new routes for achieving programmable integrated photonics with a reduced footprint compared to conventional interferometer-mesh technology.</description>

      <title>Non-symmetrical vortex beam shaping in VECSEL laser arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and numerically test a novel concept for asymmetric vortex beam generation in a Degenerate Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (DVECSEL). The method is based on a phase-locking ring array of lasers created inside a degenerate cavity with a binary amplitude mask containing circular holes. The diffraction engineering of the mask profile allows to control the complex coupling between the lasers. The asymmetry between different lasers is introduced by varying the hole diameters corresponding to different lasers. Several examples of masks with non-uniform or uniform circular holes are investigated numerically and analytically to assess the impact of non-uniform complex coupling coefficients on the degeneracy between the vortex and anti-vortex steady-states of the ring laser arrays. It is found that the in-phase solution always dominates irrespective of non-uniform masks. The only solution to make one particular vortex solution dominant over other possible steady-state solutions consists in imprinting the necessary phase shift among neighboring lasers in the argument of their coupling coefficients. We also investigate the role of the Henry factor inherent to the use of a semiconductor active medium in the probabilities to generate vortex solutions. Analytical calculations are performed to generalize a formula previously reported in Opt. Express 30, 15648 (2022) for the limiting Henry factor to cover the case of complex couplings.</description>

      <title>Effective chiral response of anisotropic multilayered metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multilayered metamaterial composed of anisotropic layers with in-plane anisotropy axes periodically rotated with respect to each other. Due to the breaking of inversion symmetry, the structure develops an effective chirality. We derive the effective chirality tensor of the metamaterial describing both normal and oblique incidence scenarios. We also identify the arrangement of the layers maximizing chiral response for the fixed lattice period, wavelength and anisotropy of the layers.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-generated large and arbitrary analog convolution kernels for accelerated machine vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks are essential for tackling complex challenges such as machine vision and medical diagnosis. Recently, to address the challenges in processing speed and power consumption of conventional digital convolution operations, many optical components have been suggested to replace the digital convolution layer in the neural network, accelerating various machine vision tasks. Nonetheless, the analog nature of the optical convolution kernel has not been fully explored. Here, we develop a spatial frequency domain training method to create arbitrarily shaped analog convolution kernels using an optical metasurface as the convolution layer, with its receptive field largely surpassing digital convolution kernels. By employing spatial multiplexing, the multiple parallel convolution kernels with both positive and negative weights are generated under the incoherent illumination condition. We experimentally demonstrate a 98.59% classification accuracy on the MNIST dataset, with simulations showing 92.63% and 68.67% accuracy on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with additional digital layers. This work underscores the unique advantage of analog optical convolution, offering a promising avenue to accelerate machine vision tasks, especially in edge devices.</description>

      <title>Balanced Air-Biased Detection of Terahertz Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel balanced air-biased coherent detection scheme for capturing ultrabroadband terahertz (THz) waveforms is implemented. The balanced detection scheme allows for coherent detection at the full repetition rate of the laser system without requiring bias modulation, signal generators, or lock-in amplifiers while doubling the dynamic range and quadrupling the signal-to-noise ratio compared to conventional air-biased coherent detection. These advantages are achieved by rotating the bias electrodes by 90{\deg} relative to the conventional scheme. With a 1 kHz driving laser, the scheme enables sub-second, high-fidelity waveform acquisition with a continuously moving delay stage, demonstrated by collecting 200 waveforms in 100 s. The balanced detection scheme paves the way for much faster and higher quality 2D ultrabroadband terahertz spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic approach to linear cross-talk in multimode fiber systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical thermodynamic theory is extended to low-power multimode fiber systems to characterize with simple thermodynamic models the complex scenario of power exchange induced by random mode coupling between propagating modes. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that low-power multimodal systems can give rise to steady-states described by a weighted Bose-Einstein modal power distribution. The theory applies also at quantum power level, indicating that optical thermodynamics and quantum optics coexist, allowing the study of multimodal optical systems in both classical and quantum regimes and simplifying the design of SDM systems.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Invisible through Speckle Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering obscures information carried by wave by producing a speckle pattern, posing a common challenge across various fields, including microscopy and astronomy. Traditional methods for extracting information from speckles often rely on significant physical assumptions, complex devices, or intricate algorithms. Recently, machine learning has emerged as a scalable and widely adopted tool for interpreting speckle patterns. However, most current machine learning techniques depend heavily on supervised training with extensive labeled datasets, which is problematic when labels are unavailable. To address this, we propose a strategy based on unsupervised learning for speckle recognition and evaluation, enabling to capture high-level information, such as object classes, directly from speckles without labeled data. By deriving invariant features from speckles, this method allows for the classification of speckles and facilitates diverse applications in image sensing. We experimentally validated our strategy through two significant applications: a noninvasive glucose monitoring system capable of differentiating time-lapse glucose concentrations, and a high-throughput communication system utilizing multimode fibers in dynamic environments. The versatility of this method holds promise for a broad range of far-reaching applications, including biomedical diagnostics, quantum network decoupling, and remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Enhanced Quantum Holography with Undetected Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holography is an essential technique of generating three-dimensional images. Recently, quantum holography with undetected photons (QHUP) has emerged as a groundbreaking method capable of capturing complex amplitude images. Despite its potential, the practical application of QHUP has been limited by susceptibility to phase disturbances, low interference visibility, and limited spatial resolution. Deep learning, recognized for its ability in processing complex data, holds significant promise in addressing these challenges. In this report, we present an ample advancement in QHUP achieved by harnessing the power of deep learning to extract images from single-shot holograms, resulting in vastly reduced noise and distortion, alongside a notable enhancement in spatial resolution. The proposed and demonstrated deep learning QHUP (DL-QHUP) methodology offers a transformative solution by delivering high-speed imaging, improved spatial resolution, and superior noise resilience, making it suitable for diverse applications across an array of research fields stretching from biomedical imaging to remote sensing. DL-QHUP signifies a crucial leap forward in the realm of holography, demonstrating its immense potential to revolutionize imaging capabilities and pave the way for advancements in various scientific disciplines. The integration of DL-QHUP promises to unlock new possibilities in imaging applications, transcending existing limitations and offering unparalleled performance in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Electrical Spectroscopy of Polaritonic Nanoresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most captivating properties of polaritons is their capacity to confine light at the nanoscale. This confinement is even more extreme in two-dimensional (2D) materials. 2D polaritons have been investigated by optical measurements using an external photodetector. However, their effective spectrally resolved electrical detection via far-field excitation remains unexplored. This fact hinders their potential exploitation in crucial applications such as sensing molecules and gases, hyperspectral imaging and optical spectrometry, banking on their potential for integration with silicon technologies. Herein, we present the first electrical spectroscopy of polaritonic nanoresonators based on a high-quality 2D-material heterostructure, which serves at the same time as the photodetector and the polaritonic platform. We employ metallic nanorods to create hybrid nanoresonators within the hybrid plasmon-phonon polaritonic medium in the mid and long-wave infrared ranges. Subsequently, we electrically detect these resonators by near-field coupling to a graphene pn-junction. The nanoresonators simultaneously present a record of lateral confinement and high-quality factors of up to 200, exhibiting prominent peaks in the photocurrent spectrum, particularly at the underexplored lower reststrahlen band of hBN. We exploit the geometrical and gate tunability of these nanoresonators to investigate their impact on the photocurrent spectrum and the polaritonic's waveguided modes. This work opens a venue for studying this highly tunable and complex hybrid system, as well as for using it in compact platforms for sensing and photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Giant Magneto-Exciton Coupling in 2D van der Waals CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic order via external fields or heterostructures enables precise manipulation and tracking of spin and exciton information, facilitating the development of high-performance optical spin valves. However, the weak magneto-optical signals and instability of two dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials have hindered comprehensive studies on the complex coupling between magnetic order and excitons in bulk-like systems. Here, we leverage magneto-optical spectroscopy to reveal the impact of magnetic order on exciton-phonon coupling and exciton-magnetic order coupling which remains robust even under non-extreme temperature conditions (80 K) in thick layered CrSBr. A 0.425T in-plane magnetic field is sufficient to induce spin flipping and transition from AFM to ferromagnetic (FM) magnetic order in CrSBr, while magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy under an out-of-plane magnetic field provides direct insight into the complex spin canting behavior in thicker layers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong coupling between excitons and magnetic order, especially the 32 meV exciton energy shift during magnetic transitions, stems from the hybridization of Cr and S orbitals and the larger exciton wavefunction radius of higher-energy B excitons. These findings offer new opportunities and a solid foundation for future exploration of 2D AFM materials in magneto-optical sensors and quantum communication using excitons as spin carriers.</description>

      <title>Windmill droplets. Optical-induced rotation of biphase oil-in-water droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of microdroplet manipulation, optical tweezers have been used to form and grow droplets, move them to specific locations, or to measure forces between droplet pairs. However, the exploration of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in optically trapped droplets remains largely uncharted. Here, we report the rotation of biphasic droplets fabricated by co-emulsifying two immiscible liquids (i.e., hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon oils) with a refractive index mismatch in water. When trapped, droplets of a specific geometry begin to rotate around the axis of the laser beam, in what appears to be a dissipative, out-of-equilibrium phenomenon. The rotational frequency, obtained from image analysis of the rotating droplets, is stable and proportional to the beam power. Remarkably, droplets that do not interact with the trapping beam can also be rotated indirectly. This is achieved by positioning the droplets at the center of a circular arrangement of multiple, sequentially activated traps. In this case, the droplet orients towards the location of the active trap by a mechanism yet to be understood. Altogether, our results demonstrate out-from-equilibrium phenomenology in optically trapped biphase droplets, which could inspire the development of devices based on them (e.g., optically induced mixing, etc.). In addition, they may shed light on fundamental principles of optical manipulation of asymmetric particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. It employs finite temporal coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. Presented interferometry promises direct applications in Doppler-free atomic and molecular spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: We report the observation of a two-dimensional dam break flow of a photon fluid in a nonlinear optical crystal. By precisely shaping the amplitude and phase of the input wave, we investigate the transition from one-dimensional (1D) to two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear dynamics. We observe wave breaking in both transverse spatial dimensions with characteristic timescales determined by the aspect ratio of the input box-shaped field. The interaction of dispersive shock waves propagating in orthogonal directions gives rise to a 2D ensemble of solitons. Depending on the box size, we report the evidence of a dynamic phase characterized by a constant number of solitons, resembling a 1D solitons gas in integrable systems. We measure the statistical features of this gaseous-like phase. Our findings pave the way to the investigation of collective solitonic phenomena in two dimensions, demonstrating that the loss of integrability does not disrupt the dominant phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the filtering challenges in microwave-optical quantum transduction through optomechanical four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optical quantum transduction is a key enabling technology in quantum networking, but has been plagued by a formidable technical challenge. As most microwave-optical-transduction techniques rely on three-wave mixing processes, the processes consume photons from a driving telecom-band (pump) laser to convert input microwave photons into telecom-band photons detuned from the laser by this microwave frequency. However, cleanly separating out single photons detuned only a few GHz away from a classically bright laser in the same spatial mode requires frequency filters of unprecedented extinction over a very narrow transition band, straining the capabilities of today's technology. Instead of confronting this challenge directly, we show how one may achieve the same transduction objective with comparable efficiency using a four-wave mixing process in which $pairs$ of pump photons are consumed to produce transduced optical photons widely separated in frequency from the pump. We develop this process by considering higher-order analogues of photoelasticity and electrostriction than those used in conventional optomechanics, and examine how the efficiency of this process can be made to exceed conventional optomechanical couplings.</description>

      <title>Influence of Feedback Phase on Time Delay Signature and Chaos Bandwidth in a Laser subject to Dual Optical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor lasers subject to optical feedback can behave chaotically, which can be used as a source of randomness. The optical feedback, provided by mirrors at a distance, determines the characteristics of the chaos and thus the quality of the randomness. However, this fixed distance also shows itself in the intensity, an unwanted feature called the Time Delay Signature (TDS). One promising solution to suppress the TDS is using double optical feedback. We study this system numerically in this paper. In particular, we focus on the impact of the feedback phase, a sub-wavelength change in the position of the mirrors, on the TDS and chaos bandwidth (CBW) of the system. We show that by precisely setting the feedback parameters, including the feedback phases, the TDS can be suppressed, and that the feedback phase control is necessary rather than optional to robustly suppress the TDS. In addition, it is possible to suppress the TDS without loss of the CBW. At strong feedback rates the system can restabilize, and one can switch between a chaotic and steady state by changing only the feedback phase. Finally, we relate the feedback phase sensitivity to interference between the two delayed signals. This system is promising for applications of chaotic lasers as one can either suppress the TDS or increase the CBW.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional gradient force optical trapping in dielectric nanocavities by inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15102v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical trapping enables precise control of individual particles of different sizes, such as atoms, molecules, or nanospheres. Optical tweezers provide free-space omnidirectional optical trapping of objects in laboratories around the world. As an alternative to standard macroscopic setups based on lenses, which are inherently bound by the diffraction limit, plasmonic and photonic nanostructures promise trapping by near-field optical effects on the extreme nanoscale. However, the practical design of lossless waveguide-coupled nanostructures capable of trapping sub-wavelength-sized particles in all spatial directions has until now proven insurmountable. In this work, we demonstrate an omnidirectional optical trap realized by inverse-designing fabrication-ready integrated dielectric nanocavities. The sub-wavelength optical trap is designed to rely solely on the gradient force and is thus particle-size agnostic. In particular, we show how a trapped particle with a radius of 15 nm experiences a force strong enough to overcome room-temperature thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, through the robust inverse design framework, we tailor manufacturable devices operating at short-wave infrared and near-infrared wavelengths. Our results open a new regime of levitated optical trapping by achieving a deep trapping potential capable of trapping single sub-wavelength particles in all directions using optical gradient forces. We anticipate potentially groundbreaking applications of the optimized optical trapping system for biomolecular analysis in aqueous environments, levitated cavity-optomechanics, and cold atom physics, constituting an important step towards realizing integrated bio-nanophotonics and mesoscopic quantum mechanical experiments.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of frequency downconverted arm length stabilization for a future upgraded gravitational wave detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors consist of complex multiple optical cavity systems. An arm-length stabilization (ALS) system has played an important role in bringing such complex detector into operational state and enhance the duty cycle. The sensitivity of these detectors can be improved if the thermal noise of their test mass mirror coatings is reduced. Crystalline AlGaAs coatings are a promising candidate for this. However, traditional ALS system with frequency-doubled 532 nm light is no longer an option with AlGaAs coatings due to the narrow bandgap of GaAs, thus alternative locking schemes must be developed. In this letter, we describe an experimental demonstration of a novel ALS scheme which is compatible with AlGaAs coatings. This ALS scheme will enable the use of AlGaAs coatings and contribute to improved sensitivity of future detectors.</description>

      <title>Laser Printing of Silver and Silver Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09340v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that direct laser writing in aqueous silver nitrate with a $\lambda$ = 1030 nm femtosecond laser results in deposition of a mixture of silver oxide and silver, in contrast to the pure silver deposition previously reported with 780 nm femtosecond direct laser writing. However, adding photoinitiator prevents silver oxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, the resistivity of the material can also be controlled by photoinitiator concentration with resistivity being reduced from approximately 9e-3 $\Omega$m to 3e-7 $\Omega$m. Silver oxide peaks dominate the X-ray diffraction spectra when no photoinitiator is present, while the peaks disappear with photoinitiator concentrations above 0.05 wt%. A THz polarizer and metamaterial are printed as a demonstration of silver oxide printing.</description>

      <title>Quantum efficiency and vertical position of quantum emitters in hBN determined by Purcell effect in hybrid metal-dielectric planar photonic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) advantageously combine excellent photophysical properties with a potential for integration in highly compact devices. Progress towards scalable integration necessitates a high quantum efficiency and an efficient photon collection. In this context, we compare the optical characteristics of individual hBN color centers generated by electron irradiation, in two different electromagnetic environments. We keep track of well-identified emitters that we characterize before and after dry transfer of exfoliated crystals. This comparison provides information about their quantum efficiency - which we find close to unity - as well as their vertical position in the crystal with nanometric precision, which we find away from the flake surfaces. Our work suggests hybrid dielectric-metal planar structures as an efficient tool for characterizing quantum emitters in addition to improving the count rate, and can be generalized to other emitters in 2D materials or in planar photonic structures.</description>

      <title>General theory of a moving Fabry-Perot interferometer and its application to the Pound-Drever-Hall technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a follow-up effort to our prior report on the optical transmission of a moving Fabry-Perot interferometer \cite{Pyvovar}, this work seeks to establish a general framework that describes the transmission and reflection properties of a Fabry-Perot interferometer when key components in its operation system, including the light source, the detector and the interferometer itself, have relative motions against each other along their common optical axis. Our analysis indicates that these movements result in various new factors in the transmission and reflection coefficients, which all find their roots in the Doppler effect. As a demonstration of its potential application, the new theory is applied to the Pound-Drever-Hall frequency-locking technique. It is shown that velocity-induced frequency modulations are effectively added to the laser frequency due to the motions, and such excess frequency noise can be impactful in certain applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Neural Engine for Solving Scientific Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is the cornerstone of scientific research and development. Data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches are emerging to accelerate time-consuming and computation-intensive numerical simulations of PDEs. Although optical systems offer high-throughput and energy-efficient ML hardware, there is no demonstration of utilizing them for solving PDEs. Here, we present an optical neural engine (ONE) architecture combining diffractive optical neural networks for Fourier space processing and optical crossbar structures for real space processing to solve time-dependent and time-independent PDEs in diverse disciplines, including Darcy flow equation, the magnetostatic Poisson equation in demagnetization, the Navier-Stokes equation in incompressible fluid, Maxwell's equations in nanophotonic metasurfaces, and coupled PDEs in a multiphysics system. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the capability of the ONE architecture, which not only leverages the advantages of high-performance dual-space processing for outperforming traditional PDE solvers and being comparable with state-of-the-art ML models but also can be implemented using optical computing hardware with unique features of low-energy and highly parallel constant-time processing irrespective of model scales and real-time reconfigurability for tackling multiple tasks with the same architecture. The demonstrated architecture offers a versatile and powerful platform for large-scale scientific and engineering computations.</description>

      <title>Polaromechanics: photons, magnons and phonons in the triple strong-coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel polaromechanical hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at low bath temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.</description>
