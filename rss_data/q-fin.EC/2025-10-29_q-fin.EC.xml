      <title>What Work is AI Actually Doing? Uncovering the Drivers of Generative AI Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23669v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems like ChatGPT, Claude AI, etc., has a deep impact on how work is done. Predicting how AI will reshape work requires understanding not just its capabilities, but how it is actually being adopted. This study investigates which intrinsic task characteristics drive users' decisions to delegate work to AI systems. Methodology: This study utilizes the Anthropic Economic Index dataset of four million Claude AI interactions mapped to O*NET tasks. We systematically scored each task across seven key dimensions: Routine, Cognitive, Social Intelligence, Creativity, Domain Knowledge, Complexity, and Decision Making using 35 parameters. We then employed multivariate techniques to identify latent task archetypes and analyzed their relationship with AI usage. Findings: Tasks requiring high creativity, complexity, and cognitive demand, but low routineness, attracted the most AI engagement. Furthermore, we identified three task archetypes: Dynamic Problem Solving, Procedural &amp; Analytical Work, and Standardized Operational Tasks, demonstrating that AI applicability is best predicted by a combination of task characteristics, over individual factors. Our analysis revealed highly concentrated AI usage patterns, with just 5% of tasks accounting for 59% of all interactions. Originality: This research provides the first systematic evidence linking real-world generative AI usage to a comprehensive, multi-dimensional framework of intrinsic task characteristics. It introduces a data-driven classification of work archetypes that offers a new framework for analyzing the emerging human-AI division of labor.</description>

      <title>How Does Environmental Information Disclosure Affect Corporate Environmental Performance? Evidence from Chinese A-Share Listed Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global climate warming and air pollution pose severe threats to economic development and public safety, presenting significant challenges to sustainable development worldwide. Corporations, as key players in resource utilization and emissions, have drawn increasing attention from policymakers, researchers, and the public regarding their environmental strategies and practices. This study employs a two-way fixed effects panel model to examine the impact of environmental information disclosure on corporate environmental performance, its regional heterogeneity, and the underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrate that environmental information disclosure significantly improves corporate environmental performance, with the effect being more pronounced in areas of high population density and limited green space. These findings provide empirical evidence supporting the role of environmental information disclosure as a critical tool for improving corporate environmental practices. The study highlights the importance of targeted, region-specific policies to maximize the effectiveness of disclosure, offering valuable insights for promoting sustainable development through enhanced corporate transparency.</description>

      <title>Moment connectedness and driving factors in the energy-food nexus: A time-frequency perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With escalating macroeconomic uncertainty, the risk interlinkages between energy and food markets have become increasingly complex, posing serious challenges to global energy and food security. This paper proposes an integrated framework combining the GJRSK model, the time-frequency connectedness analysis, and the random forest method to systematically investigate the moment connectedness within the energy-food nexus and explore the key drivers of various spillover effects. The results reveal significant multidimensional risk spillovers with pronounced time variation, heterogeneity, and crisis sensitivity. Return and skewness connectedness are primarily driven by short-term spillovers, kurtosis connectedness is more prominent over the medium term, while volatility connectedness is dominated by long-term dynamics. Notably, crude oil consistently serves as a central transmitter in diverse connectedness networks. Furthermore, the spillover effects are influenced by multiple factors, including macro-financial conditions, oil supply-demand fundamentals, policy uncertainties, and climate-related shocks, with the core drivers of connectedness varying considerably across different moments and timescales. These findings provide valuable insights for the coordinated governance of energy and food markets, the improvement of multilayered risk early-warning systems, and the optimization of investment strategies.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Immigration on Places and People -- Identification and Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most studies on the labor market effects of immigration use repeated cross-sectional data to estimate the effects of immigration on regions. This paper shows that such regional effects are composites of effects that address fundamental questions in the immigration debate but remain unidentified with repeated cross-sectional data. We provide a unifying empirical framework that decomposes the regional effects of immigration into their underlying components and show how these are identifiable from data that track workers over time. Our empirical application illustrates that such analysis yields a far more informative picture of immigration's effects on wages, employment, and occupational upgrading.</description>

      <title>Are They Willing to Participate? A Review on Behavioral Economics Approach to Voters Turnout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the fundamental factors influencing the rate and manner of Electoral participation with an economic model-based approach. In this study, the structural parameters affecting people's decision making are divided into two categories. The first category includes general topics such as economic and livelihood status, cultural factors and, also, psychological variables. In this section, given that voters are analyzed within the context of consumer behavior theory, inflation and unemployment are considered as the most important economic factors. The second group of factors focuses more on the type of voting, with emphasis on government performance. Since the incumbent government and its supportive voters are in a game with two Nash equilibrium, and also because the voters in most cases are retrospect, the government seeks to keep its position by a deliberate change in economic factors, especially inflation and unemployment rates. Finally, to better understand the issue, a hypothetical example is presented and analyzed in a developing country in the form of a state-owned populist employment plan.</description>

      <title>Implicit quantile preferences of the Fed and the Taylor rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal monetary policy when a central bank maximizes a quantile utility objective rather than expected utility. In our framework, the central bank's risk attitude is indexed by the quantile index level, providing a transparent mapping between hawkish/dovish stances and attention to adverse macroeconomic realizations. We formulate the infinite-horizon problem using a Bellman equation with the quantile operator. Implementing an Euler-equation approach, we derive Taylor-rule-type reaction functions. Using an indirect inference approach, we derive a central bank risk aversion implicit quantile index. An empirical implementation for the US is outlined based on reduced-form laws of motion with conditional heteroskedasticity, enabling estimation of the new monetary policy rule and its dependence on the Fed risk attitudes. The results reveal that the Fed has mostly a dovish-type behavior but with some periods of hawkish attitudes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Plant-Product Productivity via First-Order Conditions: Robust Replication of Orr (2022)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the replicability of Orr (2022)'s method for estimating within-plant productivity across product lines, which combines demand estimation with cost minimization. The original study uses input price shocks in other output markets as instrumental variables, with exclusion restrictions based on downstream purchase shares. Reconstructing the original dataset of Indian machinery producers from 2000-2007, we reproduce the main productivity patterns and demonstrate their robustness to variations in the exclusion threshold. The main results remain robust in extended samples (2010-2019, 2000-2019) when calibrating demand parameters to Orr (2022)'s 2000-2007 estimates, as estimation on these extended periods yields inadmissible demand systems.</description>

      <title>The human-machine paradox: how collaboration creates or destroys value, and why augmentation is key to resolving it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14057v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When deploying artificial skills, managers widely assume that combining them with the human factor is a safe harbor, mitigating the risks of full automation in high-complexity tasks. This paper formally challenges the economic validity of this widespread assumption, arguing that the true bottom-line economic utility of a human-machine skill policy is dangerously misunderstood and highly contingent on situational and design factors. To investigate this gap, we develop an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in empirical pragmatism to quantify the economic impact of human and machine skills in the execution of tasks presenting varying levels of complexity. Our results show that a human-machine strategy can yield the highest economic utility in complex scenarios, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine approach can perform worse than either the machine-exclusive or the human-exclusive policy, actively destroying value under the pressure of costs that are not compensated by sufficient performance gains. The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: when the context is complex and critical, simply allocating human and machine skills to a task may be insufficient, and far from being a silver-bullet solution or a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving augmentation.</description>

      <title>Central Bank Digital Currency, Flight-to-Quality, and Bank-Runs in an Agent-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse financial stability and welfare impacts associated with the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in a macroeconomic agent-based model. The model considers firms, banks, and households interacting on labour, goods, credit, and interbank markets. Households move their liquidity from deposits to CBDC based on the perceived riskiness of their banks. We find that the introduction of CBDC exacerbates bank-runs and may lead to financial instability phenomena. The effect can be changed by introducing a limit on CBDC holdings. The adoption of CBDC has little effect on macroeconomic variables but the interest rate on loans to firms goes up and credit goes down in a limited way. CBDC leads to a redistribution of wealth from firms and banks to households with a higher bank default rate. CBDC may have negative welfare effects, but a bound on holding enables a welfare improvement.</description>
