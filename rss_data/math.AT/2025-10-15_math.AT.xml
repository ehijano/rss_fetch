      <title>Geometric Constructions of Mod $p$ Cohomology Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brown Representability Theorem implies that cohomology operations can be represented by continuous maps between Eilenberg-Maclane spaces. These Eilenberg-Maclane spaces have explicit geometric models as spaces of cycles on round spheres and spaces of relative cycles on unit disks, due to the Almgren Isomorphism Theorem. A. Nabutovsky asked what maps between spaces of cycles represent the Steenrod squares.
  In this work we answer this question by constructing maps with explicit formulas from spaces of cycles on spheres to spaces of relative cycles on disks that represent all Steenrod squares, as well as all Steenrod powers and Bockstein homomorphisms on mod $p$ cohomology, for all primes $p$.</description>

      <title>Cone length and Lusternik-Schnirelmann category in rational homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lusternik-Schnirelmann category (LS-category) of a topological space is the least integer $n$ such that there is a covering of $X$ by $n+1$ open sets, each of them being contractible in $X$. The cone length is the minimum number of cofibations necessary to get a space in the homotopy type of $X$, starting from a suspension and attaching suspensions. The LS-category of a space is always less than or equal to its cone length. Moreover, these two invariants differ by at most one. In 1981, J.-M. Lemaire and F. Sigrist conjectured that they are always equal for rational spaces. This conjecture is clearly true for spaces of LS-category 1 and, in 1986, Y. F\'elix and J-C. Thomas verify it for spaces of LS-category 2. But, in 1999, the general conjecture is invalidated by N. Dupont who built a rational space of cone-length 4 and LS-category 3. In this work, we provide examples of rational spaces of cone-length $(k+1)$ and LS-category $k$ for any $k&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Localization of Representative cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the persistence heatmap, a parametrized summary based on representative cycles in persistence diagrams, designed to enhance stability and explainability in topological data analysis. Algorithms to compute persistence diagrams produce representative cycles and boundaries. These chains are difficult to use because they are unstable to perturbations of the input. Instead, we average to produce chains with real-valued coefficients. We prove Lipschitz stability and uniform continuity of our heatmap. Moreover, we use machine learning to learn a task-specific parametrization of the heatmap.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures of ReLU Neural Network Activation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral cell-count, as the model is trained.</description>

      <title>TopROI: A topology-informed network approach for tissue partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mammalian tissue architecture is central to biological function, and its disruption is a hallmark of disease. Medical imaging techniques can generate large point cloud datasets that capture changes in the cellular composition of such tissues with disease progression. However, regions of interest (ROIs) are usually defined by quadrat-based methods that ignore intrinsic structure and risk fragmenting meaningful features. Here, we introduce TopROI, a topology-informed, network-based method for partitioning point clouds into ROIs that preserves both local geometry and higher-order architecture. TopROI integrates geometry-informed networks with persistent homology, combining cell neighbourhoods and multiscale cycles to guide community detection. Applied to synthetic point clouds that mimic glandular structure, TopROI outperforms quadrat-based and purely geometric partitions by maintaining biologically plausible ROI geometry and better preserving ground-truth structures. Applied to cellular point clouds obtained from human colorectal cancer biopsies, TopROI generates ROIs that preserve crypt-like structures and enable persistent homology analysis of individual regions. This study reveals a continuum of architectural changes from healthy mucosa to carcinoma, reflecting progressive disorganisation in tissue structure. TopROI thus provides a principled and flexible framework for defining biologically meaningful ROIs in large point clouds, enabling more accurate quantification of tissue organization and new insights into structural changes associated with disease progression.</description>

      <title>CuMPerLay: Learning Cubical Multiparameter Persistence Vectorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes. Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured image analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.02220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For all $k \ge 2$, we show that there exists a group $G$ and a non-free stably free $\mathbb{Z} G$-module of rank $k$. We use this to show that, for all $k \ge 2$, there exist homotopically distinct finite $2$-complexes with fundamental group $G$ and with Euler characteristic exceeding the minimal value over $G$ by $k$. This resolves Problem D5 in the 1979 Problem List of C. T. C. Wall. We also explore a number of generalisations and present a potential application to the topology of closed smooth 4-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21606v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enhance the pointed quandle counting invariant of linkoids through the use of quivers analogously to quandle coloring quivers. This allows us to generalize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids. Additionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree quiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers of linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology via Ellipsoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology is one of the most popular methods in topological data analysis. An initial step in its use involves constructing a nested sequence of simplicial complexes. There is an abundance of different complexes to choose from, with \v{C}ech, Rips, alpha, and witness complexes being popular choices. In this manuscript, we build a novel type of geometrically informed simplicial complex, called a Rips-type ellipsoid complex. This complex is based on the idea that ellipsoids aligned with tangent directions better approximate the data compared to conventional (Euclidean) balls centered at sample points, as used in the construction of Rips and Alpha complexes. We use Principal Component Analysis to estimate tangent spaces directly from samples and present an algorithm for computing Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes, i.e., topological descriptors based on Rips-type ellipsoid complexes. Additionally, we show that the ellipsoid barcodes depend continuously on the input data so that small perturbations of a k-generic point cloud lead to proportionally small changes in the resulting ellipsoid barcodes. This provides a theoretical guarantee analogous, if somewhat weaker, to the classical stability results for Rips and \v{C}ech filtrations. We also conduct extensive experiments and compare Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes with standard Rips barcodes. Our findings indicate that Rips-type ellipsoid complexes are particularly effective for estimating the homology of manifolds and spaces with bottlenecks from samples. In particular, the persistence intervals corresponding to ground-truth topological features are longer compared to those obtained using the Rips complex of the data. Furthermore, Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes lead to better classification results in sparsely sampled point clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes outperform Rips barcodes in classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-Hausdorff manifolds over locally ordered spaces via sheaf theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally ordered spaces can be used as topological models of concurrent programs: in that setting, the local order models the irreversibility of time during execution. Under certain conditions, one can even work with locally ordered manifolds. In this paper, we build the universal euclidean local order over every locally ordered space; in categorical terms, the subcategory of euclidean local orders is coreflective in the category of locally ordered spaces. Then we give conditions to ensure that it preserves the execution traces of the corresponding program. Our construction is based on a well-known correspondance between sheaves on a space and \'etale bundles over this space. This is a far reaching generalization of a result about realizations of graph products. We particularize the construction to locally ordered realization of precubical sets, and show that it admits a purely combinatorial description. With the same proof techniques, we show that, unlike for the topological realization, there is a unique precubical set whose locally ordered realization is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Matsushita model structure on loop graphs, which is right-transferred from the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets, factors through two other right-transferred model structures on simplicial complexes and reflexive graphs. We show that each Quillen adjunction between these right-transferred model categories is a Quillen equivalence. These model structures are analogous to the Thomason model structure on small categories, and we prove that they are all cofibrantly generated and proper. Furthermore we show that all cofibrant simplicial complexes are flag complexes, and all forests are cofibrant.</description>

      <title>Motivic Homotopy Groups of Spheres and Free Summands of Stably Free Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Working over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, we show that the motivic stable homotopy groups of the sphere spectrum can be determined entirely from the motivic homotopy groups of the $p$-completed sphere spectra and the motivic cohomology of the ground field, except possibly for the $0$ and $-1$-stems. Using this, we show that the complex realization map from the motivic homotopy group to the classical stable homotopy group is an isomorphism in a range of bidegrees. We apply this to deduce that complex realization also induces isomorphisms on unstable homotopy groups for Stiefel varieties $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n_k)$ in a range of bidegrees. This allows a complete solution of the question of when the projection map $V_r(\mathbb{A}^n_k) \to V_1(\mathbb{A}^n_k)$ admits a right inverse. Equivalently, this settles the question of when the universal stably-free module of type $(n,n-1)$ admits a free summand of given rank.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Bieri--Neumann--Strebel--Renz (BNSR) invariants of irreducible uniform lattices. In the case of a direct product of a tree and a Euclidean space we show that vanishing of the BNSR invariants for all finite-index subgroups of a given uniform lattice is equivalent to irreducibility. On the other hand we construct irreducible uniform lattices which admit maps to the integers whose kernels' finiteness properties are determined by the finiteness properties of certain Bestvina--Brady groups.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Chromatic Number via High Dimensional Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometrization method that transforms a $(d+1)$-connected graph $G$ into a $(d-1)$-dimensional manifold $U^{d-1}(G)$ is first established through adding some $i$-balls with $2\le i \le d-1$ into $G$ such that the $j$-th homotopy group is trivial for $j=0, 1, \dots, d-2$. On this basis, we establish a sufficient condition for $U^{d-1}(G)$ to be embedded into $\mathbb{R}^d$ and an upper bound for $\chi(G)$, the chromatic number of $G$. To be more specific, we prove that if $G$ contains neither $K_{d+3}$ nor $K_{3,d+1}$ as a minor, then $U^{d-1}(G)$ embeds into $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\chi(G) \leq d(d+1)$. Furthermore, based on the above theorem, we extend the Discharging method, originally developed for the study of the four color theorem, to $\mathbb{R}^d$. This generalized approach can be applied to investigate the coloring problems in $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>
