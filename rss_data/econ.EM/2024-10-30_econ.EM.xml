      <title>Economic Diversification and Social Progress in the GCC Countries: A Study on the Transition from Oil-Dependency to Knowledge-Based Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gulf Cooperation Council countries -- Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia -- holds strategic significance due to its large oil reserves. However, these nations face considerable challenges in shifting from oil-dependent economies to more diversified, knowledge-based systems. This study examines the progress of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in achieving economic diversification and social development, focusing on the Social Progress Index (SPI), which provides a broader measure of societal well-being beyond just economic growth. Using data from the World Bank, covering 2010 to 2023, the study employs the XGBoost machine learning model to forecast SPI values for the period of 2024 to 2026. Key components of the methodology include data preprocessing, feature selection, and the simulation of independent variables through ARIMA modeling. The results highlight significant improvements in education, healthcare, and women's rights, contributing to enhanced SPI performance across the GCC countries. However, notable challenges persist in areas like personal rights and inclusivity. The study further indicates that despite economic setbacks caused by global disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility, GCC nations are expected to see steady improvements in their SPI scores through 2027. These findings underscore the critical importance of economic diversification, investment in human capital, and ongoing social reforms to reduce dependence on hydrocarbons and build knowledge-driven economies. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers aiming to strengthen both social and economic resilience in the region while advancing long-term sustainable development goals.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Political Stability in GCC Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political stability is crucial for the socioeconomic development of nations, particularly in geopolitically sensitive regions such as the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain. This study focuses on predicting the political stability index for these six countries using machine learning techniques. The study uses data from the World Banks comprehensive dataset, comprising 266 indicators covering economic, political, social, and environmental factors. Employing the Edit Distance on Real Sequence method for feature selection and XGBoost for model training, the study forecasts political stability trends for the next five years. The model achieves high accuracy, with mean absolute percentage error values under 10, indicating reliable predictions. The forecasts suggest that Oman, the UAE, and Qatar will experience relatively stable political conditions, while Saudi Arabia and Bahrain may continue to face negative political stability indices. The findings underscore the significance of economic factors such as GDP and foreign investment, along with variables related to military expenditure and international tourism, as key predictors of political stability. These results provide valuable insights for policymakers, enabling proactive measures to enhance governance and mitigate potential risks.</description>

      <title>Doubly Robust Inference in Causal Latent Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a new estimator of average treatment effects under unobserved confounding in modern data-rich environments featuring large numbers of units and outcomes. The proposed estimator is doubly robust, combining outcome imputation, inverse probability weighting, and a novel cross-fitting procedure for matrix completion. We derive finite-sample and asymptotic guarantees, and show that the error of the new estimator converges to a mean-zero Gaussian distribution at a parametric rate. Simulation results demonstrate the relevance of the formal properties of the estimators analyzed in this article.</description>

      <title>International vulnerability of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a globalised world, inflation in a given country may be becoming less responsive to domestic economic activity, while being increasingly determined by international conditions. Consequently, understanding the international sources of vulnerability of domestic inflation is turning fundamental for policy makers. In this paper, we propose the construction of Inflation-at-risk and Deflation-at-risk measures of vulnerability obtained using factor-augmented quantile regressions estimated with international factors extracted from a multi-level Dynamic Factor Model with overlapping blocks of inflations corresponding to economies grouped either in a given geographical region or according to their development level. The methodology is implemented to inflation observed monthly from 1999 to 2022 for over 115 countries. We conclude that, in a large number of developed countries, international factors are relevant to explain the right tail of the distribution of inflation, and, consequently, they are more relevant for the vulnerability related to high inflation than for average or low inflation. However, while inflation of developing low-income countries is hardly affected by international conditions, the results for middle-income countries are mixed. Finally, based on a rolling-window out-of-sample forecasting exercise, we show that the predictive power of international factors has increased in the most recent years of high inflation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Preference-based Linear Bandits via Human Response Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive preference learning systems present humans with queries as pairs of options; humans then select their preferred choice, allowing the system to infer preferences from these binary choices. While binary choice feedback is simple and widely used, it offers limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which inversely correlate with preference strength, as complementary information. We introduce a computationally efficient method based on the EZ-diffusion model, combining choices and response times to estimate the underlying human utility function. Theoretical and empirical comparisons with traditional choice-only estimators show that for queries where humans have strong preferences (i.e., "easy" queries), response times provide valuable complementary information and enhance utility estimates. We integrate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating response times significantly accelerates preference learning.</description>
