      <title>Quasi-superfluid and Quasi-Mott phases of strongly interacting bosons in shallow optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the ground states of strongly interacting bosons in the vanishingly small and weak lattices using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB) which calculate numerically exact many-body wave function. Two new many-body phases: fragmented or quasi superfluid (QSF) and incomplete fragmented Mott or quasi Mott insulator (QMI) are emerged due to the strong interplay between interaction and lattice depth. Fragmentation is utilized as a figure of merit to distinguish these two new phases. We utilize the eigenvalues of the reduced one-body density matrix and define an order parameter that characterizes the pathway from a very weak lattice to a deep lattice. We provide a detailed investigation through the measures of one- and two-body correlations and information entropy. We find that the structures in one- and two-body coherence are good markers to understand the gradual built-up of intra-well correlation and decay of inter-well correlation with increase in lattice depth.</description>

      <title>Chaos-assisted Turbulence in Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a turbulence-sustaining mechanism in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, which is based on the chaotic nature of internal spin dynamics. Magnetic driving induces a complete chaotic evolution of the local spin state, thereby continuously randomizing the spin texture of the condensate to maintain the turbulent state. We experimentally demonstrate the onset of turbulence in the driven condensate as the driving frequency changes and show that it is consistent with the regular-to-chaotic transition of the local spin dynamics. This chaos-assisted turbulence establishes the spin-driven spinor condensate as an intriguing platform for exploring quantum chaos and related superfluid turbulence phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by the second-order Glauber correlation function, play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Multiple polaron quasiparticles with dipolar fermions in a bilayer geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Fermi polaron problem with dipolar fermions in a bilayer geometry, where a single dipolar particle in one layer interacts with a Fermi sea of dipolar fermions in the other layer. By evaluating the polaron spectrum, we obtain the appearance of a series of attractive branches when the distance between the layers diminishes. We relate these to the appearance of a series of bound two-dipole states when the interlayer dipolar interaction strength increases. By inspecting the orbital angular momentum component of the polaron branches, we observe an interchange of orbital character when system parameters such as the gas density or the interlayer distance are varied. Further, we study the possibility that the lowest energy two-body bound state spontaneously acquires a finite center of mass momentum when the density of fermions exceeds a critical value, and we determine the dominating orbital angular momenta that characterize the pairing. Finally, we propose to use the tunneling rate from and into an auxiliary layer as an experimental probe of the impurity spectral function.</description>

      <title>Microscopic many-body theory of two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of exciton-polarons in one-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a microscopic many-body theory of two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) for a model of polarons in one-dimensional (1D) materials. Our theory accounts for contributions from all three processes: excited-state emission (ESE), ground-state bleaching (GSB), and excited-state absorption (ESA). While the ESE and GSB contributions can be accurately described using a Chevy's ansatz with one particle-hole excitation, the ESA process requires information about the many-body eigenstates involving two impurities. To calculate these double polaron states, we have extended the Chevy's ansatz with one particle-hole excitation. The validity of this ansatz was verified by comparing our results with an exact calculation using Bethe's ansatz. Our numerical results reveal that in the weak interaction limit, the ESA contribution cancels out the total ESE and GSB contributions, resulting in less significant spectral features. However, for strong interactions, the features of the ESA contribution and the combined ESE and GSB contributions remain observable in the 2DCS spectra. These features provide valuable information about the interactions between polarons. Additionally, we have investigated the mixing time dynamics, which characterize the quantum coherences of the polaron resonances. Overall, our theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and interpreting the 2DCS spectra of polarons in 1D materials, shedding light on their interactions and coherent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermalization rate of polaritons in strongly-coupled molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polariton thermalization is a key process in achieving light-matter Bose--Einstein condensation, spanning from solid-state semiconductor microcavities at cryogenic temperatures to surface plasmon nanocavities with molecules at room temperature. Originated from the matter component of polariton states, the microscopic mechanisms of thermalization are closely tied to specific material properties. In this work, we investigate polariton thermalization in strongly-coupled molecular systems. We develop a microscopic theory addressing polariton thermalization through electron-phonon interactions (known as exciton-vibration coupling) with low-energy molecular vibrations. This theory presents a simple analytical method to calculate the temperature-dependent polariton thermalization rate, utilizing experimentally accessible spectral properties of bare molecules, such as the Stokes shift and temperature-dependent linewidth of photoluminescence, in conjunction with well-known parameters of optical cavities. Our findings demonstrate qualitative agreement with recent experimental reports of nonequilibrium polariton condensation in both ground and excited states, and explain the thermalization bottleneck effect observed at low temperatures. This study showcases the significance of vibrational degrees of freedom in polariton condensation and offers practical guidance for future experiments, including the selection of suitable material systems and cavity designs.</description>
