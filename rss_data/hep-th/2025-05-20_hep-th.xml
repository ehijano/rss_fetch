      <title>Holographic entanglement entropy and complexity for the cosmological braneworld model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study \cite{Park:2020jio}, the time-dependent entanglement entropy of the universe undergoing expansion according to various power laws has been analyzed within the framework of the braneworld model. The results of the entanglement entropy in that paper take into account only the effects of a radiation and a matter-dominated universe. In this work, we have computed the time-dependent entanglement entropy and complexity of the FLRW universe in the presence of different matter sources (radiation, matter and some exotic matter). In contrast to the approach in \cite{Park:2020jio}, all the calculations in this paper have been carried out in a perturbative manner in the framework of braneworld model of cosmology. According to this model, our universe is situated on a brane and different matter sources appear on the brane due to the back reaction of different $p$-brane gas configurations in the bulk spacetime. By considering the bulk spacetime as a black brane geometry, we have considered different blackening factors corresponding to radiation, matter, and exotic matter and calculated entanglement entropy and complexity holographically. In the braneworld model, the universe's expansion is described by the brane's time-dependent radial position. This position is determined using the second Israel junction condition for various matter sources. The time evolution of entanglement entropy and complexity is then obtained by substituting this brane position. We have also shown the dependence of entanglement entropy and complexity on the cosmological time for all the different matter-dominated universes in the early and late time eras. Even though the calculations of holographic entanglement entropy and complexity are done perturbatively, the results remain consistent with those of \cite{Park:2020jio}.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Kleinian horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-dual black holes in (2,2) signature spacetime -- Klein space -- have recently attracted interest in the context of celestial holography. Motivated by this development, we investigate the structure of spacetime near the horizons of these solutions. Focusing on the self-dual Schwarzschild-Taub-NUT solution, we demonstrate that, near the Kleinian horizons, the geometry exhibits a local infinite-dimensional symmetry generated by supertranslations and superrotations. Establishing this result requires refining and extending earlier analyses of asymptotic symmetries near null surfaces. We formulate the appropriate boundary conditions, derive the infinite-dimensional algebra underlying the local symmetries, and compute the associated Noether charges, finding them to be integrable. Finally, we discuss the connection of our findings to recent observations in the literature regarding self-dual black holes in Klein space, including the diffeomorphism relating static and stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>Holographic explorations of regular black holes in pure gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently established in \textit{Phys.Lett.B 861 (2025) 139260} that regular, asymptotically flat black holes exist in pure gravity theories in dimension greater than four. We extend this result to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes and perform bottom-up holographic explorations: Hawking-Page phase transitions, quasinormal modes of black holes providing decay times of excitations in the finite temperature conformal field theory and U-shaped string probes leading to the quark-antiquark potential in the dual field theory. The gravitational action contains a bared, negative cosmological constant and an Einstein-Hilbert term, supplemented by an infinite series of higher-curvature terms of the family known as Quasi-topological (QT) Lagrangians, leading to a lapse function in terms of infinite series which can be resumed to an analytic function for different coupling choices. The QT terms are defined as those satisfying a Birkhoff's theorem and possessing a holographic c-function, and exist at all orders in the curvature, for arbitrary dimension greater than four. Besides presenting the general formulae, we explore the physics of three specific cases leading to Hayward, Dymnikova and Bardeen-like regular black holes. We also found the field redefinition that permits recasting the $\alpha'^3 W^4$ correction of Type IIB supergravity on $\mathcal{A}_5\times S^5$ as a series of QT terms. Before finishing, beyond holography, we also provide an extended thermodynamic setup, that via variations of the dimensionful $\alpha$ and $L$, allow obtaining the Euler relation between finite thermodynamical quantities for the black hole of the theory.</description>

      <title>Root-$T\overline{T}$ deformed CFT partition functions at large central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the partition function of 2d CFT under root-$T\bar{T}$ deformation. We demonstrate that the deformed partition function satisfies a flow equation. At large central charge sector, the deformed partition function reduces to a redefinition of the modular parameters, which preserves modular invariance under the deformed parameters. We then derive a Cardy-like formula for the asymptotic density of states using modular bootstrap trick. In the context of AdS/CFT, it was proposed the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed CFT corresponds to the AdS$_3$ with certain deformed boundary condition. We show the deformed BTZ black hole is a quotient of hyperbolic space. In terms of Chern-Simons formulation, we compute the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed BTZ black hole entropy and find that it obeys a Cardy-like formula, which is consistent with the modular bootstrap result. Furthermore, employing the Wilson spool technique, we compute the one-loop partition functions for the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed AdS$_3$ geometry. Our results reveal an exact match between one-loop gravitational partition function and the large $c$ expansion of root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed CFT partition function.</description>

      <title>Complex scalar field in \kappa-Minkowski noncommutative spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparison between translation charges for several Lagrangians for the $\kappa$-deformed complex scalar field using the canonical method. The Lagrangians are shown to be related by charge conjugation and twisted cyclicity, and these relationships are reflected in their conserved charges. The Lagrangian corresponding to the results obtained in arXiv:2011.09188 and arXiv:2201.10191 is identified, providing an explanation for the observed loss of charge conjugation symmetry under boosts.</description>

      <title>Dressed D-strings with Instability and Transverse Rotation: The Open String Pair Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to the Schwinger effect in the quantum electrodynamics, a system of two parallel D-branes at a finite separation can produce open string pairs through their interaction. In this paper, we investigate this rate for the dressed D1-branes, incorporating electric and tachyonic fields and also transverse rotation in the presence of the background Kalb-Ramond field within a partially compactified spacetime. Besides, we study various special cases.</description>

      <title>Virasoro OPE Blocks, Causal Diamonds, and Higher-Dimensional CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory (CFT), multi-stress tensor exchanges between probe operators give rise to the Virasoro identity conformal block, which is fixed by symmetry. The analogous object, and the corresponding organizing principles, in higher dimensions are less well understood. In this paper, we study the Virasoro identity OPE block, which is a bilocal operator that projects two primaries onto the conformal family of multi-stress tensor states. Generalizing a known construction of global OPE blocks, our formalism uses integrals over nested causal diamonds associated with two timelike-separated insertions. We argue that our construction is adaptable to higher dimensions, and use it to provide a new derivation of the single-stress tensor exchange contribution to a four-point correlator in both three and four dimensions, to leading order in the lightcone limit. We also comment on a potential description using effective reparametrization modes in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>New Collective Modes in Weyl Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the doubled representation of Dirac spinors, we write the Lagrangian of a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor in a covariant form . Then, based on an analogy with the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model and by employing the Fierz transformations, we demonstrate that new collective modes should exist in such a system, including a pseudo-scalar Nambu-Goldstone boson and its corresponding amplitude mode plus a vector and an axial-vector collective mode. It is also observed that the pseudo-scalar mode can become massive due to an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term in the Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Divergences in the effective interaction between Chern-Simons bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the vector extension of the Standard Model (SM) with Chern-Simons type interaction. This extension contains a new massive vector boson (Chern-Simons boson) that does not interact directly with fermions of the SM. We consider the effective loop interaction of a new vector boson with fermions of the SM and its renormalizability in an arbitrary gauge. Our analysis shows that loop divergences cannot be eliminated in the effective interaction between Chern-Simons bosons and fermions of the same flavor, whereas the effective loop interaction with fermions of different flavors remains well-defined. The interaction terms between the Chern-Simons boson and fermions of the same flavor, characterised by divergent prefactors, have been identified. These interactions should be treated within the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>A Charged and Neutral Spin-$4$ Currents in the Grassmannian-like Coset Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By calculating the second order pole in the operator product expansion (OPE) between the charged spin-$3$ current and the neutral spin-$3$ current, we determine the primary charged spin-$4$ current. Similarly by computing the second order pole in the OPE between the neutral spin-$3$ current and itself, we obtain the primary neutral spin-$4$ current. We determine the OPE between the charged spin-$2$ current and the charged spin-$3$ current for generic parameters and the infinity limit of the level $k$ (one of the parameters) is also given for this OPE. In particular, the above primary charged spin-$4$ current occurs at the first order pole of this OPE for generic parameters. We also check that the above primary charged and neutral spin-$4$ currents occur at the second order pole of the OPE between the charged spin-$3$ current and itself for fixed parameters.</description>

      <title>Holographic composite Higgs model and gravitational waves produced during first order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The soft-wall holographic composite Higgs model assumes first-order phase transition from the dynamical inner symmetry breaking. This research focuses on the implications of the semi-analytical perturbative solution of the dual 5-dimensional theory as an effective description of the strongly coupled composite Higgs sector. We clarify the thermodynamical description and gravitational waves spectrum produced during the phase transition, which were previously numerically estimated. Besides, we investigate the limits of the applicability of our solution within the thin-wall approximation and quasiclassical approach in terms of the dual theory, that correspond to the strongly coupled regime of composite Higgs model. Our semi-analytic framework provides description of the strong first-order phase transition within the runaway scenario.</description>

      <title>On classification of (self-dual) higher-spin gravities in flat space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a great number of higher-spin gravities in $3d$ that can have both finite and infinite spectra of fields and can be formulated as Chern-Simons theories. It was believed that this is impossible in higher dimensions, where higher-spin fields do have propagating degrees of freedom. We show that there are infinitely many higher-spin theories in the $4d$ flat space featuring nontrivial local interactions that can have either a finite or infinite number of fields. We classify all one- and two-derivative (i.e. with gauge and gravitational interactions) higher-spin theories by solving the holomorphic constraint in the light-cone gauge obtained by Metsaev. Therefore, these theories are consistent subsectors of the higher-spin extensions of self-dual Yang-Mills/gravity, which in turn are truncations of the chiral higher-spin gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we reconsider the study of five-dimensional supersymmetric black branes in the context of the M-theory compactification on a special Calabi-Yau manifold called tetra-quadric, being realized as complete intersections of homogenous polynomials in the projective space $ \mathbb{CP}^{1}\times\mathbb{CP}^{1}\times\mathbb{CP}^{1}\times\mathbb{CP}^{1}$. Combining colored graph theory and outer-automorphism group action techniques, we approach the tetra-quadric Calabi-Yau diagram leading to new features. Using a procedure referred to as folding, we show that M-theory black branes on the tetra-quadric Calabi-Yau manifold can be reduced to known compactifications with lower dimensional K\"{a}hler moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Ring of AdS Reissner Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m Black Holes with Euler Heisenberg Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study, situated within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, employs wave optics methods to investigate the Einstein ring structure of quantum corrected AdS Reissner Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black holes governed by Euler Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamics. A wave source placed on the AdS boundary yields a response function on the antipodal side, from which a virtual optical system with a convex lens reconstructs the holographic image of the Einstein ring. The analysis systematically explores the impact of physical parameters and observer position on the ring's morphology. As the observer's position varies, the image transitions from a complete ring to an arc and eventually to a single bright point. The Einstein ring radius is observed to decrease with increasing radial source position $\rho$, wave frequency $\omega$, and chemical potential $\mu$, while it increases with electric charge $e$ and temperature $T$. In contrast, the quantum correction parameter $a$ has negligible effect on the ring radius or response amplitude, as its contribution falls off rapidly near the boundary and remains subleading in the wave dynamics. The parameter $e$ enhances the electromagnetic lensing strength, leading to a broader ring, whereas increasing $\rho$ alters wavefront propagation, affecting both brightness peak and ring location. Geometric optics analysis confirms that the incident angle of the photon ring matches the Einstein ring angle, validating consistency across frameworks. Overall, the results highlight how nonlinear electromagnetic effects and bulk field configurations manifest in observable boundary features, providing a means to distinguish quantum-corrected black holes from classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian renormalisation VIII. P(Phi,2) quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormalisation of free field theories in all spacetime dimensions. In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the self-interacting scalar field in two spacetime dimensions with polynomial potential, called P(Phi,2). We consider only the finite volume case.
  The P(Phi,2) theory is one of the few interacting QFT's that can be rigorously constructed non-perturbatively. We find that our Hamiltonian renormalisation flow finds this theory indeed as a fixed point.</description>

      <title>On consistency of the interacting (anti)holomorphic higher-spin sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recently proposed generating systems for the (anti)holomorphic sector of the 4d higher spin theory and for the off-shell higher spin theory in generic dimension locality was achieved due to a peculiar limiting star product. Even though the generating systems exhibit all-order locality, the product itself encounters uncertainties when functions from specific classes are multiplied. This fact leads to the absence of the Leibniz rule for the differential operator acting on the auxiliary variables $z$ and, hence, its ambiguous definition in the generating equations. We identify the gap in the original proof of consistency associated with this freedom. Nonetheless considered generating systems are perfectly consistent as shown by direct computations on the resulting vertices. Considering specific orderings of fields we show that consistency rests on the star-exchange-like identities for the limiting star product formulated and proved here. Connection with the 4d Vasiliev theory is discussed.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ Bulk Hilbert Space in ETH Matrix Model for double-scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the notion of chord number in the strict large $N$ double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) model to the corresponding finite $N$ ETH matrix model. The chord number in the strict large $N$ DSSYK model is known to correspond to the discrete length of the Einstein-Rosen bridge in the gravity dual, which reduces to the renormalized geodesic length in JT gravity at weak coupling. At finite $N$, these chord number states can be constructed but form an overcomplete basis of the non-perturbative Hilbert space, as the structure of the inner product gets significantly modified due to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem: There are infinitely many null states. In this paper, by considering ``EFT for gravitational observables'' or a version of ``non-isometric code'', we construct a family of chord number operators at finite $N$. While the constructed chord number operator depends on the reference chord number state, it realizes approximate $q$-deformed oscillator algebra and reproduces semiclassical bulk geometry around the reference state. As a special case, we will show that when the reference is chosen to be the chord number zero state, the chord number operator precisely matches with the Krylov state complexity, leading to the ``ramp-slope-plateau'' behavior at late times, implying the formation of ``gray hole''.</description>

      <title>Topology and the Infrared Structure of Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study infrared divergences in quantum electrodynamics using geometric phases and the adiabatic approximation in quantum field theory. In this framework, the asymptotic \textit{in} and \textit{out} states are modified by Berry phases, $e^{i \Delta \alpha_{\text{in}}}$ and $e^{i \Delta \alpha_{\text{out}}}$, which encode the infrared structure non-perturbatively and regulate soft-photon divergences.
  Unlike the Faddeev--Kulish formalism, which employs perturbative dressing with coherent states, our approach reformulates the effective action in terms of Berry connections in field space. This yields finite, gauge-invariant scattering amplitudes without requiring a sum over soft-photon emissions.
  We show that infrared divergences cancel to all orders in the bremsstrahlung vertex function $\Gamma^\mu(p_1, p_2)$, due to destructive interference among inequivalent Berry phases. As an application, we study the formation of positronium in the infrared regime and argue that the dressed \(S\)-matrix exhibits a functional singularity at $s = 4 m_e^2$, corresponding to a physical pole generated by topological flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In holographic quantum gravity, Euclidean pieces of the spacetime appear in the large N limit as representing semi-classical states of the theory. In this essay, we argue that the duals of entangled states are spacetime geometries that contain Euclidean regions in order to preserve classical connectivity. Thereby, the proposal is to extend the ER-EPR conjecture to regimes whether wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridges) become unstable but the entangled structure of the dual state persists.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a novel approach combining the Uhlmann gauge bundle with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Matrix Product State (MPS) techniques to enhance the representation and preservation of quantum coherence in strongly correlated many-body systems. Conventional DMRG and MPS methods frequently encounter limitations when dealing with subtle quantum correlations and entanglement structures near critical points, avoided crossings, and topologically ordered phases. By integrating the dynamical Uhlmann gauge potential and its categorical extensions into the numerical optimization and truncation procedures, our approach substantially improves coherence stability and accuracy. Through illustrative applications in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum dynamics, we demonstrate significant enhancements in precision and reliability, underscoring the broad potential of Uhlmann gauge-enhanced computational methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study, via perturbative methods, the rates of production of $W$ bosons emitted in neutrino decays during the early stages of the Universe. We compute the transition amplitude corresponding to the first order of de Sitter electro-weak perturbation theory and study its various limiting cases. The transition rates are derived using minimal subtraction and dimensional regularization. In the end we obtain the density number of bosons (as a function of temperature), and give an estimation of this number for different temperatures and fixed values of the particle momenta.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence and Chaotic Dynamics: Guiding Molecular Machines Toward Low-Entropy States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence profoundly alters classical thermodynamic expectations by modifying the structure and accessibility of probability distributions. Classically, transitions to lower-entropy states (local second-law violations) are exponentially suppressed, as lower-entropy configurations have fewer available microstates and are statistically improbable. However, introducing quantum coherence and structured quantum interference among semiclassical trajectories significantly changes this scenario. Quantum coherence reduces local entropy by establishing correlations among states that are classically independent, effectively restructuring probability amplitudes to channel transitions toward otherwise improbable low-entropy states. We analyze this phenomenon explicitly within the framework of semiclassical approximations, employing the Van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator to quantify how interference terms arising from coherent superpositions modify classical fluctuation theorems. We demonstrate that quantum coherence, especially when combined with chaos-assisted dynamical tunneling, greatly enhances the probability of transitions to low-entropy configurations, creating pronounced counter-ergodic effects. Furthermore, by considering purification of mixed quantum states, we propose methodologies for deliberately engineering quantum phases among interfering pathways. This phase engineering can explicitly enhance coherence-driven transitions into lower-entropy states, providing a novel thermodynamic resource. Finally, we explore the feasibility of molecular-scale quantum machines exploiting these principles, highlighting their potential applications in quantum thermodynamics and quantum biology for performing useful work through coherence-mediated entropy reduction.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Regular Black Holes in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct regular black holes with anti-de Sitter asymptotics in theories incorporating infinite towers of higher-order curvature corrections in any dimension $D \ge 5$. We find that regular black branes are generically inner-extremal, potentially evading instabilities typically associated with inner horizons. Considering minimally coupled matter, we establish general criteria for the existence of singularity-free solutions. We analyze solutions coupled to Maxwell and nonlinear (Born--Infeld and RegMax) electrodynamics, demonstrating in the latter case the first examples of fully regular gravitational and electromagnetic fields for all parameter values. Here, we find that the ratio of the gravitational mass to the electrostatic self-energy determines whether the regular core is de Sitter or anti-de Sitter. We perform a detailed analysis of the black hole thermodynamics and show that the equation of state exhibits features akin to those of fluids with a finite molecular volume induced by the regularization parameter.</description>

      <title>Quintessence Dark Energy from non-perturbative Higgs-Yang-Mills mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that dark energy arises from a strongly-coupled Higgs-Yang-Mills set of interacting fields in the non-perturbative regime. We choose the simplest $SU(2)$ representation, which is compatible with the Cosmological Principle. One of the components of the Higgs doublet act as an effective quintessence scalar field interacting with both gravity and the gauge field. We devise a multiple time scale approach to solve the equations of motion through a hierarchy of the couplings, utilizing exact solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. We observe that the time scale of variation of the Hubble constant is the slowest one, while, for the scalar field, assuming that its self-coupling is smaller than the coupling of the gauge field, represents an intermediate time scale. From the consistency of the Friedmann equations, we show how the effect of the scalar field is to give origin to dark energy with a proper equation of state corrected by a very small time-dependent term. Finally, agreement with cosmological data for the dark energy density is shown without relying on the fine-tuning of the physical constants of the model.</description>

      <title>Geodesics and scalar perturbations of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole with a global monopole surrounded by a quintessence field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive investigation of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole with a global monopole surrounded by a quintessence field. Our analysis focuses on the geodesic motion of both null and timelike particles, enabling precise determination of the photon sphere and quantification of forces acting on photon particles. We systematically examine how the deformation parameter, control parameter, global monopole parameter, and quintessence field parameter influence the energy, angular momentum, and angular velocities of test particles in circular orbits within the equatorial plane. Additionally, we derive and analyze the perturbative potentials for scalar and electromagnetic fields, demonstrating how these parameters modify their structural profiles. Through time-domain integration, we explore the evolution of scalar and electromagnetic perturbations, revealing distinct phases of transient behavior and quasinormal ringing. Finally, we investigate the emission rates of this black hole, establishing connections between its shadow radius and thermal characteristics. Our findings reveal that the global monopole parameter, deformation parameter and quintessence field enhance black hole stability by reducing emission rates, while the control parameter, which helps avoid central singularities, accelerates evaporation by increasing emission.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of Loop Quantum Gravity Black Holes with Quintessence Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) within the framework of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) surrounded by quintessence field. Our comprehensive analysis shows that the interplay between quantum corrections and exotic matter produces unique spacetime features, most notably a triple-horizon structure for specific parameter combinations. We derive the metric function incorporating both LQG parameters ($\alpha$, $B$) and quintessence parameters ($c$, $w$), analyzing its implications for horizon structure through embedding diagrams. We examine null and timelike geodesics, calculating photon spheres, effective potentials, and orbital dynamics. Our study demonstrates how quantum and quintessence parameters affect BH shadow size and shape, offering potential observational signatures. Through scalar perturbation analysis, we compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) frequencies, confirming the stability of these hybrid BHs while identifying distinctive spectral characteristics. Finally, using the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) theorem modified approach, we derive an analytical expression for gravitational deflection angles, showing a hierarchical structure of contributions from classical, quintessence, and quantum effects at different distance scales.</description>

Abstract: By analogy with heavy ion collisions, which can be modelled by a classical hydrodynamics, it is proposed that the differential cross section for collisions of smaller nuclei can be calculated from the classical, numerical scattering data for Skyrmions. It is also suggested that the numerical data for the outgoing particles should be classified into bins, as is done in nuclear physics experiments.</description>

Abstract: We consider the spectral decomposition of singularities of integrals and their integrands. Our results apply to any integral of Euler-Mellin type, and thus especially to every scalar Feynman integral. Specifically we provide for both the integrand and integral respectively; two explicit constructions of the characteristic variety and characteristic cycle of the constructible function and $D$-module they are associated with. From this we also obtain the singular locus or Landau singularities of the integral. En route we give a simple procedure to compute the local Euler obstruction function of a variety, and using this, to compute the Euler characteristic of the complex link of a Whitney stratum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that quantitative concepts from quantum information theory can play a role in analysing collider physics, including elucidating new physics. In this paper, we study various QI measures including magic, trace distance and fidelity distance, in generic new physics scenarios modelled by the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. We argue that such measures can indeed show up differences with respect to the pure Standard Model, and we compare our results with similar findings for the concurrence discussed previously in the literature. We examine the relative sensitivity of different measures to new physics in two-dimensional bins of the top pair invariant mass and scattering angle, finding that the concurrence, magic and trace distance each emerge as the best measure in at least some regions of the phase space. This highlights the importance of exploring multiple quantum information measures in the hunt for beyond the Standard Model physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of bumblebee gravity, this work explores how non-metricity alters the behavior and propagation of neutrinos. Our analysis is based on the black hole configuration introduced in Ref. [1], focusing on how the spacetime deformation affects some neutrino-related processes. Three primary aspects are fundamentally taken into account: the modification in the energy deposition rate stemming from neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, the alterations in the oscillation phase caused by the background geometry, and the role of lensing effects on the transition probabilities among neutrino flavors. Complementing the analytical approach, numerical evaluations of oscillation probabilities are performed within a two-flavor scenario, accounting for both inverted and normal mass ordering configurations.</description>

      <title>Spin-weighted spherical harmonics as total angular momentum eigenstates for massless particles and their role in obstructing spin-orbital decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for massless particles of helicity $h$, the angular momentum eigenstates are given in an appropriate coordinate system by the spin-weighted spherical harmonics ${_{-h}Y_{jm}}$ of spin-weight $-h$. In particular, these are simultaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, helicity, $J^2$, and $J_z$. The appearance of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics as opposed to the ordinary spherical harmonics reflects the nontrivial topological structure of massless particles with nonzero helicity. The resultant angular momentum multiplet structure is quite different than that of massive particles, with $|h|$ acting as a lower bound on $J^2$ and at most one multiplet for each angular momentum $j$. This illustrates the obstruction to a spin-orbital decomposition of the angular momentum for massless particles, as such a sparse multiplet structure does not result from any reasonable spin-orbital splitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a mathematically foundational level, our most successful physical theories (gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories) are formulated in a framework based on the differential geometry of connections on principal bundles. After reviewing the essentials of this framework, we articulate the generalized hole and point-coincidence arguments, examining how they weight on a substantivalist position towards bundle spaces. This question, then, is considered in light of the Dressing Field Method, which allows a manifestly invariant reformulation of gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories, making their conceptual structure more transparent: it formally implements the point-coincidence argument and thus allows to define (dressed) fields and (dressed) bundle spaces immune to hole-type arguments.</description>

Abstract: Conformal symmetries, i.e.\ coordinate transformations that preserve angles, play a key role in many fields, including physics, mathematics, computer vision and (geometric) machine learning. Here we build a neural network that is equivariant under general conformal transformations. To achieve this, we lift data from flat Euclidean space to Anti de Sitter (AdS) space. This allows us to exploit a known correspondence between conformal transformations of flat space and isometric transformations on the AdS space. We then build upon the fact that such isometric transformations have been extensively studied on general geometries in the geometric deep learning literature. We employ message-passing layers conditioned on the proper distance, yielding a computationally efficient framework. We validate our model on tasks from computer vision and statistical physics, demonstrating strong performance, improved generalization capacities, and the ability to extract conformal data such as scaling dimensions from the trained network.</description>

      <title>Basis light-front quantization approach to deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the deuteron's wave functions as eigenstates of the light-front quantum chromodynamics (QCD) Hamiltonian using a fully relativistic and nonperturbative approach based on light-front quantization, without an explicit confining potential. These eigenstates include six-quark and six-quark--one-gluon components. The deuteron wave function consists of both a singlet-singlet color state and additional hidden color states arising from non-trivial color rearrangements. Our results reveal that while the singlet-singlet state is present, the hidden color states collectively dominate, contributing a larger probability to the deuteron wave function. This highlights the significant role of hidden color components in the QCD description of nuclear structure. Using these wave functions, we investigate the deuteron's electromagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Experimental Particle Physics Priorities 2025: A String Phenomenology Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the SNOWMASS 2021 process in the US and the on--going European Strategy Report 2025, the field of elementary particle physics is undergoing detailed community evaluation, and the experimental particle physics program, which requires substantial public investment, is under scrutiny. We offer an assessment of the current experimental particle physics priorities from a string phenomenology point of view. String theory provides a perturbatively consistent framework for quantum gravity. String phenomenology aims to connect between string theory and observational data. String theory is a consistent theory of quantum gravity that contains the other fundamental constituents of matter and interactions. As all forms of energy couple to gravity, string theory provides a framework that reproduces the structures of the Standard Model of particle physics and gives rise to detailed physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model, {\it e.g.} dark matter candidates, axions, additional gauge symmetries, etc. Given this breadth, we propose that from a string phenomenology perspective, the experimental particle physics priority is the nature of the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. An ideal facility in the near future to study this sector is a hadron collider at 50--60 TeV that utilises contemporary magnet technology and can be built in 10--15 years from decision.</description>

      <title>Stark Energy Shifts due to Quantum Gravity in RGUP Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Stark effect in the hydrogen atom under an external electric field, incorporating relativistic generalized uncertainty principle (RGUP) corrections within Minkowskian spacetime and calculate the upper bound on $\beta$ the RGUP parameter. Employing RGUP algebra and the Stetsko-Tkachuk approximation, we derive modifications to the energy spectrum for degenerate and non-degenerate states. The perturbed Hamiltonian, modified by RGUP, enfold quantum gravitational effects. Our results reveal quantum gravitational corrections to the Stark energy spectrum in the relativistic regime, with energy shifts for non-degenerate ($n=1$) and degenerate ($n \neq 1$) cases showing additional terms proportional to $\beta$. These findings reduce to standard Stark effect results and non-relativistic GUP frameworks in the limits $\beta\rightarrow 0$ and $c \rightarrow \infty $, establishing our model as a generalized framework for analyzing minimal length effects in relativistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian renormalisation IX. U(1)**3 quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous works in this series we focussed on Hamiltonian renormalisation of free field theories in all spacetime dimensions or interacting theories in spacetime dimensions lower than four. In this paper we address the Hamiltonian renormalisation of the U(1)**3 model for Euclidian general relativity in four spacetime dimensions which is self-interacting.
  The Hamiltonian flow needs as an input a choice of *-algebra and corresponding representation thereof or state on it at each resolution scale. If one uses as input the algebras and states that were used in the recent exact solutions of this model, then one finds that the flow is rapidly fixed pointed. </description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic parameters of fluids on conformally connected spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local thermal equilibrium generally implies the absence of heat flux within a fluid. We find the relations between a set of thermodynamic variables of a fluid on a general spacetime and those defined on a conformally connected spacetime, assuming both descriptions are at thermal equilibrium. The scaling relations appear to be consistent with Dicke's heuristic argument and the previous analysis done on the basis of various restrictions. Within the present framework, it is observed that the satisfaction of Klein's law on one of the spacetimes implies its validity on the other one. Moreover, our analysis bypasses some of the imposed restrictions and thereby reveals the generality of the earlier predictions. These relations are further shown to preserve the geometric structure of thermodynamics, known as geometrothermodynamics, such that the associated metrics on two conformally connected spacetimes are themselves conformally related. This provides an alternative consistency check as well as a distinct geometric interpretation of the relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a search for boosted dark matter from Primordial Black Holes (PBH) evaporation using the DarkSide-50 ionization-signal-only dataset corresponding to the experiment's ($12202\pm180$) ${\rm kg\: d}$ exposure. We focus on evaporation of PBHs with masses in the range [$10^{14},\,10^{16}$] g producing Dirac fermionic dark matter particles with sub-GeV kinetic energy. These relativistic particles, with energies up to hundreds of MeV, can generate detectable signals for masses below $\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV. The absence of a signal enables setting complementary limits to those derived from cosmological observations and direct detection searches for cosmic ray-boosted dark matter.</description>

Abstract: Given a family of varieties, the Euler discriminant locus distinguishes points where Euler characteristic differs from its generic value. We introduce a hypergeometric system associated with a flat family of very affine locally complete intersection varieties. It is proven that the Euler discriminant locus is its singular locus and is purely one-codimensional unless it is empty. Of particular interest is a family of very affine hypersurfaces. We coin the term hypergeometric discriminant for the characteristic variety of the hypergeometric system and establish a formula in terms of likelihood equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Tensor Field Theory (TFT), observables are defined through tensor field contractions that produce unitary invariants for complex-valued tensor fields. Traditionally, these observables are constructed using tensor fields of a fixed order $d$. Here, we propose an extended theoretical framework for TFT that incorporates tensor fields of varying orders $d'$, satisfying $d' \leq d$. We then establish a comprehensive group-theoretic formalism that enables the systematic enumeration of these complex TFT observables. This approach encompasses existing counting methods and therefore recovers known results in specific limiting cases. Additionally, we provide computational tools to facilitate the enumeration of these invariants, unveiling novel integer sequences that have not been documented elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Black Holes with Global Monopoles in 4D Noncommutative Einstein Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct an exact spherically symmetric black hole solution with a global monopole in the context of four-dimensional noncommutative Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We modeled the spacetime noncommutativity via a Lorentzian-smeared mass distribution. Then we study the horizon structure and find that this black hole can have two configurations: one degenerate horizon or no horizon, depending on the black hole parameters. We also analyze thermodynamics and thermal stability by computing the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. Our analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature and entropy acquire corrections from the noncommutative parameter $\Theta$, the energy scale of symmetry breaking $\eta$, and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$. The heat capacity exhibits divergences that signal second-order phase transitions. Thereafter, we study the black hole shadow employing the null geodesics and the Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation. Our results show that the shadow decreases with increasing $\Theta$ or $\alpha$ and increases with increasing $\eta$. Finally, we analyze quasinormal modes or scalar perturbations, we compute them via the 6th-order WKB method, and compare them to the shadow radius methods in the eikonal limit.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of the first and third named authors relating the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a genus zero surface with boundary to a quantized $K$-theoretic Coulomb branch. As a consequence, we see that our skein algebra arises as the Grothendieck ring of the bounded derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves on the Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima variety of triples with monoidal structure defined by the convolution product. We thus give a monoidal categorification of the skein algebra, partially answering a question posed by D. Thurston.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the notion of adjusted connection for principal 3-bundles. We first derive the explicit form of an adjustment datum for 3-term $L_\infty$-algebras, which allows us to give a local description of such adjusted connections and their infinitesimal symmetries. We then introduce the notion of an adjusted 2-crossed module of Lie groups and provide the explicit global description of principal 3-bundles with adjusted connections in terms of differential cocycles. These connections appear in a number of context within high-energy physics, and we list local examples arising in gauged supergravity and a global example arising in various contexts in string/M-theory. Our primary motivation, however, stems from U-duality, and we define a notion of categorified torus that forms an adjusted 2-crossed module, which we hope to be useful in lifting T-duality to M-theory.</description>

      <title>Constraining Reheating Temperature, Inflaton-SM Coupling and Dark Matter Mass in Light of ACT DR6 Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological implications of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 observations, in combination with Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, on the physics of inflation and post-inflationary reheating. We focus on the $\alpha$-attractor class of inflationary models (both E- and T-models) and consider two reheating scenarios: perturbative inflaton ($\phi$) decay ($\phi \rightarrow bb$) and inflaton annihilation ($\phi \phi \rightarrow bb$) into Standard Model (SM) bosonic particles ($b$). By solving the Boltzmann equations, we derive bounds on key reheating parameters, including the reheating temperature, the inflaton equation of state (EoS), and the inflaton-SM coupling, in light of ACT data. To accurately constrain the coupling, we incorporate the Bose enhancement effect in the decay width. To ensure the validity of our perturbative approach, we also identify the regime where nonperturbative effects, such as parametric resonance, become significant. Additionally, we include indirect constraints from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), which can impact the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. These constraints further bound the reheating temperature, particularly in scenarios with a stiff EoS. Finally, we analyze dark matter (DM) production through purely gravitational interactions during reheating and determine the allowed mass ranges consistent with the constrained reheating parameter space and recent ACT data. Our results highlight the constraining power of next-generation CMB datasets on inflationary dynamics, reheating, and the DM parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the modified gravity corrections. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <title>Hall effects in Carroll dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ``Do Carroll particles move?'' The answer depends on the characteristics of the particle such as its mass, spin, electric charge, and magnetic moment. A massive Carroll particle (closely related to fractons) does not move; its immobility follows from Carroll boost symmetry which implies dipole conservation, but not conversely. A massless Carroll particle may propagate by following the Hall law, consistently with the partial breaking of the Carroll boost symmetry. The framework is extended to Carroll field theory. In $d=2$ space dimensions, the Carroll group has a two-fold central extension which allows us to generalize the dynamics to massive and massless particles, including anyons. The anyonic spin and magnetic moment combine with the doubly-extended structure parameterized by two Casimir invariants interpreted as intrinsic magnetization and non-commutativity parameter. The extended Carroll particle subjected to an electromagnetic background field moves following a generalized Hall law which includes a Zeeman force. This theory is illustrated by massless, uncharged anyons with doubly-centrally extended structure we call exotic photons, which move on the horizon of a Black Hole, giving rise to an anyonic spin-Hall Effect.</description>

      <title>Thermal Diffusivity and Pole-Skipping in the Incoherent Semilocally Critical IR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pole-skipping offers compelling evidence for the hydrodynamic origin of chaotic behavior in strongly coupled quantum systems. We demonstrate that the cumulative effect of higher-order corrections to the hydrodynamic diffusive mode, captured by the parameter $\Omega$, determines the thermal diffusivity through chaos parameters, providing new insights into the interplay between chaos and hydrodynamics. In the incoherent limit, where momentum relaxation is pronounced, we show that the thermodynamically stable phase corresponds to a semi-locally critical IR fixed point. This finding extends previous analyses of simple IR fixed points and may offer a gravity dual description for stable phases beyond the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model in the incoherent regime. Additionally, we connect our findings to a universal bound on the thermal diffusion constant in holography, establishing a direct link with the dynamical critical exponent $z$. We derive a new relation, $\Omega = (2-z)/(2z-2)$, and propose that it characterizes the thermodynamically stable phase for generic values of $z$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13413v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the general method presented by Mohammedi \cite{NM} for the integrability of a sigma model on a manifold, we investigate the conditions for having an integrable deformation of the general sigma model on a manifold with a complex structure. On a Lie group, these conditions are satisfied by using the zeros of the Nijenhuis tensor. We then extend this formalism to a manifold, especially a Lie group, with a generalized complex structure. We demonstrate that, for the examples of integrable sigma models with generalized complex structures on the Lie groups $\mathbf{A_{4,8}}$ and $\mathbf{A_{4,10}}$, under special conditions, the perturbed terms of the actions are identical to the WZ terms.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological observables in perturbation theory turn out to be plagued with infrared divergences, which represents both a conceptual and computational challenge. In this paper we present a proof of concept for a systematic procedure to remove these divergences in a large class of scalar cosmological integrals and consistently define an infrared safe computable in perturbation theory. We provide diagrammatic rules which are based on the nestohedra underlying the asymptotic structure of such integrals.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we provide a short review (written in Chinese) on the Bethe/Gauge correspondence. We first explain the basic idea in an explicit example of the correspondence between XXX spin chains and 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauge theories. The connection between 4d and 2d will then be explored by comparing the instanton and vortex partition functions. We conclude this article by briefly mentioning the similarity in the integrability structure of 4d gauge theories and 2d ones from an algebraic aspect, and a potential relation between two different integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

Abstract: We study oscillons in a real scalar field theory in a (3+1)-dimensional AdS space with global coordinates. The initial configuration is given by a Gaussian shape with an appropriate core size as in Minkowski spacetime. The solution exhibits a long lifetime. In particular, since the AdS space can be seen as a box, the recurrence phenomenon can be observed under suitable conditions. In particular, as the AdS radius decreases, one can see a transition from a metastable oscillon to a stable oscillatory solution. Finally, we discuss some potential applications of the oscillon in the context of AdS/CFT duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the causal structure of Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS), including shock wave perturbations, in $D&gt;3$ using reflected null ray trajectories, either through the interior black hole or the exterior de Sitter region. Specifically, we compute the quasinormal mode frequencies in the eikonal, high-frequency, limit, by identifying the `critical time', for arbitrary values of the black hole mass. We emphasize the important role of the static sphere proper time normalization and related boundary conditions. The computed critical times indicate the presence of singularities in the late-time, large mass, scalar field correlator in SdS, which should be resolved by introducing complex geodesics consistent with interior black hole and exterior de Sitter effective thermofield double states. In addition we relate the critical time to a diverging holographic complexity observable and compute the `switchback' delay by adding a pair of shock wave perturbations for arbitrary values of the mass of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: We determine the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric $W_{1+\infty}^{2,2}[\lambda=\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra which is an extension of ${\cal N}=4$ $SO(4)$ superconformal algebra with vanishing central charge. We identify the soft current algebra between the graviton, the gravitinos, the vectors, the Majorana fermions, the scalar or the pseudoscalar, from the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}^{2,2}[\lambda=\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra, in two dimensions with the ${\cal N}=4$ supergravity theory with $SO(4)$ global symmetry in four dimensions found by Das (at Stony Brook in 1977), via celestial holography. Furthermore, the truncations of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric soft current algebra provide the soft current algebras for the ${\cal N}=2,3$ supergravity theories, the ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity coupled to its Abelian vector multiplet and the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Maxwell Einstein theory. For the ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity theory, the soft current algebra can be also realized from the ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}^{K,K}[\lambda=0]$ algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit dispersive bounds on Wilson coefficients of scalar effective field theories (EFT) coupled to gravity in various spacetime dimensions, by computing the contributions from graviton loops to the corresponding sum rules at low energies. Fixed-momentum-transfer dispersion relations are often ill-behaved due to forward singularities arising from loop-level graviton exchange, making naive positivity bounds derived from them unreliable. Instead, we perform a careful analysis using crossing-symmetric dispersion relations, and compute the one-loop corrections to the bounds on EFT coefficients. We find that including the graviton loops generically allows for negativity of Wilson coefficients by an amount suppressed by powers of Newton's constant, $G$. The exception are the few couplings that dominate over (or are degenerate with) the graviton loops at low energies. In $D=4$, we observe that assuming that the eikonal formula captures the correct forward behavior of the amplitude at all orders in $G$, and for energies of the order of the EFT cutoff, yields bounds free of logarithmic infrared divergences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of field theories with complex poles, we scrutinize four inequivalent ways of defining the scattering amplitudes, each forfeiting one or more tenets of standard quantum field theory while preserving the others: (i) a textbook Wick rotation by analytic continuation of the external momenta from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature (no optical theorem), (ii) the Lee--Wick--Nakanishi prescription, integrating along a certain contour in the complex energy plane (no Lorentz invariance), (iiii) the fakeon prescription, where, in addition, spatial momenta are integrated on a complex path defined by the locus of singularities of the loop integrand (no analyticity of the amplitude) and (iv) to work directly on Minkowski spacetime, which violates the optical theorem and also bars power-counting renormalizability. In general, mixed Euclidean-Lorentzian prescriptions for internal and external momenta in loop integrals break Lorentz invariance, regardless of the type of masses involved. We conclude that, of the above four options, only the fakeon prescription is physically viable and can have applications to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant effective actions for dressed fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new fundamental form of the path integral for theories with local symmetry is introduced. It is utilised to construct effective actions that generate correlation functions of dressed fields in Yang-Mills theories and quantum gravity. The construction entails a novel BRST symmetric gauge fixing which imposes that the on-shell correlation functions are those of gauge invariant fields. We demonstrate that the effective actions are gauge and diffeomorphism invariant respectively, with appropriate transformations for the Faddeev-Popov ghosts and Nakanishi-Lautrup fields. As a consistency check, the on-shell one-loop effective actions are shown to take the expected gauge independent form. The effective action which satisfies Zinn-Justin's master equation is also gauge invariant with the anti-fields transforming accordingly. While our choice of gauge will in general be non-linear and non-local, we argue that these gauges are in fact stable under renormalisation if one allows for general renormalised field variables.</description>

Abstract: We present a self-contained and consistent formulation of noncommutative (NC) gauge theory of gravity, focusing on spherically symmetric black hole geometries. Our construction starts from the gauge-theoretic viewpoint of Poincar\'{e} (or de Sitter) gravity and introduces noncommutativity through the Moyal star product and the Seiberg-Witten map, retaining NC gauge invariance at each order in the deformation parameter $\Theta$. Working systematically to second order in $\Theta$, we obtain explicit NC corrections to the spin connection, the vierbein, and various geometric objects such as the metric and curvature scalars. Using these results, we compute NC modifications of four-dimensional Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions, including scenarios with a cosmological constant, as well as three-dimensional BTZ-type black holes (both uncharged and charged). For each black hole solution, we explore various possible Moyal twists, each of which generally breaks some symmetries and modifies the horizon structure, surface gravity, and curvature invariants. In particular, we show that while the radial location of horizons in Schwarzschild-like solutions remains unchanged for some twists, other twists introduce important but finite deformations in curvature scalars and can decouple the Killing horizon from the causal horizon. Similar patterns arise in the charged and lower-dimensional cases. Beyond constructing explicit examples, our approach provides a blueprint for systematically incorporating short-distance quantum corrections through noncommutativity in gravitational settings. The methods and expansions we present can be extended to more general geometries including rotating black holes and additional matter fields, offering a broad framework for future studies of NC effects in classical solutions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>$\kappa$-Entanglement Entropy from Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the entanglement entropy equipped with the $\kappa$-algebra. This entanglement entropy is computed through the geometric setup as performed by Hartman-Maldacena, which, in their prescription, finds that the entropy grows linearly in time. In our case, we show that the $\kappa$-algebra embedding provides a richer scenario where the third-order corrections in time added from $\kappa$-algebra to entanglement entropy imply that the growth of quantum correlations between subsystems is more intricate than a simple linear increase into the dynamics of black hole thermalization and quantum information flow. In the context of holography, such corrections suggest that the thermalization process is not instantaneous but involves higher-order interactions between subsystems.</description>

      <title>von Neumann Subfactors and Non-invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the language of von Neumann subfactors to investigate non-invertible symmetries in two dimensions. A fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$, its module category $\mathcal{M}$, and a gauging labeled by an algebra object $\mathcal{A}$ are encoded in the bipartite principal graph of a subfactor. The dual principal graph captures the quantum symmetry $\mathcal{C}'$ obtained by gauging $\mathcal{A}$ in $\mathcal{C}$, as well as a reverse gauging back to $\mathcal{C}$. From a given subfactor $N \subset M$, we derive a quiver diagram that encodes the representations of the associated non-invertible symmetry. We show how this framework provides necessary conditions for admissible gaugings, enabling the construction of generalized orbifold groupoids. To illustrate this strategy, we present three examples: Rep$(D_4)$ as a warm-up, the higher-multiplicity case Rep$(A_4)$ with its associated generalized orbifold groupoid and triality symmetry, and Rep$(A_5)$, where $A_5$ is the smallest non-solvable finite group. For applications to gapless systems, we embed these generalized gaugings as global manipulations on the conformal manifolds of $c=1$ CFTs and uncover new self-dualities in the exceptional $SU(2)_1/A_5$ theory. For $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric TQFTs, we use the subfactor-derived quiver diagrams to characterize gapped phases, describe their vacuum structure, and classify the recently proposed particle-soliton degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Analytic approaches to anisotropic holographic superfluids in asymptotically hyperscaling violation geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore anisotropic holographic superfluidity and find analytic solutions near critical point where superfluid/normalfluid phase transition appears in a holographic dual fluid system. In arXiv:hep-th/1109.4592, the authors obtained such an analytic solution in 5-dimensional Einstein-SU(2)Yang-Mills system, and it is asymptotically AdS$_5$. What is more in this note is that we get analytic solutions near the critical point in 3- and 4- dimensional Einstein-Scalar-U(1)$\times$SU(2)Yang-Mills systems, which become asymptotically hyperscaling violation geometry. We also get leading order back reactions to the background geometry, which clearly show spatial anisotropy of the bulk geometry. To explore the properties of the spacetime, we compute holographic entanglement entropy and confirm that the superfluid/normalfluid phase transition must occur at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Notes on su$(1,2)\oplus$u$(1)$ Chern-Simons theory and Torsional Newton-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate three-dimensional torsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) gravity by gauging the su$(1,2)\oplus$u$(1)$ algebra and construct its action using the Chern-Simons theory. This TNC exhibits novel features, including the fact that the gauge fields associated with both dilatation and rotation symmetries transform non-trivially under Galilean boosts. This theory also reproduces the Schr\"odinger gravity acquired by gauging the extended $z=2$ Schr\"odinger algebra arXiv:1604.08054 via a large speed of light ($1/c$)-expansion. In particular, we explain that the $z=2$ Lifshitz vacuum solution appearing in Schr\"odinger gravity is related to the null reduction of 4d $\Omega$-background up to a conformal factor. Based on these results, we revisit the identification between the extended Schr\"odinger algebra and bosonic analogue of super BMS algebra arXiv:1905.13154. We interpret that this relation originates from the $\mathcal{W}_3^{(2)}$ algebra which acts as the bosonic analogue of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal algebra.</description>

      <title>Geodesic motion in Bogoslovsky-Finsler Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.02751v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the free motion of a massive particle moving in the background of a Finslerian deformation of a plane gravitational wave in Einstein's General Relativity. The deformation is a curved version of a one-parameter family of Relativistic Finsler structures introduced by Bogoslovsky, which are invariant under a certain deformation of Cohen and Glashow's Very Special Relativity group ISIM(2). The partially broken Carroll Symmetry we derive using Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen coordinates allows us to integrate the geodesics equations. The transverse coordinates of timelike Finsler-geodesics are identical to those of the underlying plane gravitational wave for any value of the Bogoslovsky-Finsler parameter $b$. We then replace the underlying plane gravitational wave by a homogenous pp-wave solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We conclude by extending the theory to the Finsler-Friedmann-Lemaitre model.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent conformal transformations and the propagator for quadratic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The method proposed by Inomata and his collaborators allows us to transform a damped Caldiroli-Kanai oscillator with time-dependent frequency to one with constant frequency and no friction by redefining the time variable, obtained by solving a Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation. Their mapping ``Eisenhart-Duval'' lifts as a conformal transformation between two appropriate Bargmann spaces. The quantum propagator is calculated also by bringing the quadratic system to free form by another time-dependent Bargmann-conformal transformation which generalizes the one introduced before by Niederer and is related to the mapping proposed by Arnold. Our approach allows us to extend the Maslov phase correction to arbitrary time-dependent frequency. The method is illustrated by the Mathieu profile.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves and Conformal Time Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09589v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in the "memory effect" prompted us to revisit the relation of gravitational aves and oscillators. 50 years ago Niederer [1] found that an isotropic harmonic oscillator with a constant frequency can be mapped onto a free particle. Later Takagi [2] has shown that "time-dependent scaling" extends the oscillator versus free particle correspondence to a time-dependent frequency when the scale factor satisfies a Sturm-Liouville equation. More recently Gibbons [3] pointed out that time redefinition is conveniently studied in terms of the Schwarzian derivative. The oscillator versus free particle correspondence "Eisenhart-Duval lifts" to a conformal transformation between Bargmann spaces [4-7]. These methods are extended to spacetimes which are not conformally flat and have a time-dependent profile, and can then be applied to the geodesic motion in a plane gravitational wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first part in a series of papers on counting surfaces on Calabi-Yau 4-folds. Besides the Hilbert scheme of 2-dimensional subschemes, we introduce \emph{two} types of moduli spaces of stable pairs. We show that all three moduli spaces are related by GIT wall-crossing and parametrize stable objects in the bounded derived category.
  We construct \emph{reduced} Oh-Thomas virtual cycles on the moduli spaces via Kiem-Li cosection localization and prove that they are deformation invariant along Hodge loci. As an application, we show that the variational Hodge conjecture holds for any family of Calabi-Yau 4-folds supporting a non-zero reduced virtual cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14271v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles at rest before the arrival of a burst of gravitational wave move, after the wave has passed, with constant velocity along diverging geodesics. As recognized by Souriau 50 years ago and then forgotten, their motion is particularly simple in Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen (BJR) coordinates (which are however defined only in coordinate patches): they are determined when the first integrals associated with the 5-parameter isometry group (recently identified as L\'evy-Leblond's ``Carroll'' group with broken rotations) are used. A global description can be given instead in terms of Brinkmann coordinates, however it requires to solve a Sturm-Liouville equation, whereas the relation between BJR and Brinkmann requires to solve yet another Sturm-Liouville equation. The theory is illustrated by geodesic motion in a linearly polarized (approximate) ``sandwich'' wave proposed by Gibbons and Hawking for gravitational collapse, and by circularly polarized approximate sandwich waves with Gaussian envelope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19715v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equations of motion of an isospin-carrying particle in a Yang-Mills and gravitational field were first proposed in 1968 by Kerner, who considered geodesics in a Kaluza-Klein-type framework. Two years later the flat space Kerner equations were completed by considering also the motion of the isospin by Wong, who used a field-theoretical approach. Their groundbreaking work was then followed by a long series of rediscoveries whose history is reviewed. The concept of isospin charge and the physical meaning of its motion are discussed. Conserved quantities are studied for Wu-Yang monopoles and for diatomic molecules by using van Holten's algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proves that, in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime manifold, one can consider coordinate transformations expressed by fractional linear maps which give rise to isometries and are the simplest example of coordinate transformation used to bring infinity down to a finite distance. The projective boundary of spherically symmetric spacetimes here studied is the disjoint union of three points: future timelike infinity, past timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, and the three-dimensional products of half-lines with a 2-sphere. Geodesics are then studied in the projectively transformed (t',r',theta',phi') coordinates for Schwarzschild spacetime, with special interest in their way of approaching our points at infinity. Next, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes are studied with our projective method. Since the kinds of infinity here defined depend only on the symmetry of interest in a spacetime manifold, they have a broad range of applications, which motivate the innovative analysis of Schwarzschild, Nariai, de Sitter and Godel spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using M\"obius-redefined time. It can either transform a globally defined vacuum wave into a vacuum sandwich wave, or carry the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, permutes the symmetries and the geodesics. Our pp waves with conformal O(2,1) symmetry of the second type, which seem to ahve escaped attention so far, are anisotropic generalizations of the familiar inverse-square profile. An example inspired by molecular physics, for which the particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity is studied in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the gravitational lensing of a charged black hole (spherically symmetric) within the context of Lorentz violation triggered by an antisymmetric tensor field. Our calculations consider two different scenarios: the weak and strong deflection limits. For the weak deflection limit, we employ the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to obtain our results. In the strong deflection limit, we utilize the Tsukamoto methodology, which provides measurable outcomes such as relativistic image positions and magnifications. Applying the latter methodology, we analyze the gravitational lensing by Sagittarius $A^{*}$ and derive the related observables, which are expressed as functions of the Lorentz violation parameter. Finally, the time delay is addressed as well.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on the Mass of Fundamental Fields from Primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations in the vacuum zero point energy associated to quantum fields and their statistical distributions during inflation. It is shown that the perturbations in the vacuum zero point energy have large amplitudes which are highly non-Gaussian. The effects of vacuum zero point fluctuations can be interpreted as the loop corrections in primordial power spectrum and bispectrum. Requiring that the primordial curvature perturbation to remain nearly Gaussian and the loop corrections to be under perturbative control impose strong upper bounds on the mass of fundamental fields during inflation. These bounds depend on the hierarchy of the masses in the theory such as whether or not the masses are at the similar orders. While the mass of the heaviest field in the hierarchy may not be constrained but it is shown that a combination of the masses of the fields can not be much heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, otherwise their vacuum zero point fluctuations induce large non-Gaussianities in primordial perturbations. Considering the observational upper bound on tensor to scalar ratio, we conclude that this combined mass scale is lighter than $10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Ordinary and exotic mesons in the extended Linear Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM) is a hadronic model based on the global symmetries of QCD and the corresponding explicit, anomalous, and spontaneous breaking patterns. In its basic three-flavor form, its mesonic part contains the dilaton/glueball as well as the nonets of (pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons, thus chiral symmetry is linearly realized. In the chiral limit and neglecting the chiral anomaly, only one term -- within the dilaton potential -- breaks dilatation invariance. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented by a generalization of the Mexican-hat potential, with explicit symmetry breaking responsible for its tilting. The overall mesonic phenomenology up to 2 GeV is in agreement with the PDG compilation of masses and decay widths. The eLSM was enlarged to include other conventional quark-antiquark nonets (pseudovector and orbitally excited vector mesons, (axial-)tensor mesons, etc.), as well as two nonets of hybrid mesons, the lightest one with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$ not allowed for $\bar{q}q$ objects such as the resonance $\pi_1(1600)$ and the recently discovered $\eta_1(1855)$. In doing so, different types of chiral multiplets are introduced: heterochiral and homochiral multiplets, which differ in the way they transform under chiral transformations. Moreover, besides the scalar glueball, the tensor, the pseudoscalar and the vector glueballs were coupled to the eLSM: the scalar $f_0(1710)$ turns out to be mostly gluonic, the tensor glueball couples strongly to vector mesons, and the pseudoscalar glueball couples can be assigned to $X(2370)$ or $X(2600)$. The eLSM contains chiral partners on an equal footing and is therefore well suited for studies of chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero temperature and densities. The QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint were investigated within this framework.</description>

      <title>Eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals: A gateway to probe quantum gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a loop quantum gravity (LQG) inspired rotating black hole, treating it as a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, where an inspiralling object exhibits eccentric motion around the SMBH. With the orbital dynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital evolution, and subsequently generate the gravitational waveforms. To evaluate the difference between EMRI waveforms emitted from the Kerr black hole and a spinning black hole in LQG, we compute the dephasing and mismatch using the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observation. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the modified effect of LQG with a parameter as small as $2\times10^{-6}$. The constraint on a parameter in LQG using the Fisher information matrix can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Prospects for sub-EW ALP searches via $\gamma+b\bar{b}$ signatures at the LHC using jet substructure techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data show no clear indication of new physics and only incremental improvements are anticipated at the energy frontier in the near future. However, while the focus of the LHC has been on constraining TeV scale physics, new particles could still be hiding below the electroweak scale. In order to obtain sensitivity to a new light boson with couplings to SM fermions, a potentially promising decay channel, for resonances with mass $\gtrsim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV, would be the decay to $b\bar b$ pairs. The measurement of such signatures is challenging due to the trigger requirements at the LHC. In this work, we explore the LHC sensitivity to a light pseudoscalar, or axion-like particle (ALP), in the $b\bar{b}$ final state with an associated photon, using jet substructure techniques, in the mass range between 10 GeV and 100 GeV. We obtain projected exclusions on the ALP-fermion coupling in a region of phase space which has not so far been probed by direct searches. We further discuss the impact that lower trigger thresholds may have on the LHC reach.</description>

      <title>Systematic Construction of Interfaces and Anomalous Boundaries for Fermionic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the pullback trivialization technique to systematically construct gapped interfaces and anomalous boundaries for fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) states by extending their symmetry group $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times_{\omega_2} G$ to larger groups. These FSPT states may involve decoration layers of both Majorana chains and complex fermions. We derive general consistency formulas explicitly for (2+1)D and (3+1)D systems, where nontrivial twists arise from fermionic symmetric local unitaries or "gauge transformations" that ensure coboundaries vanish at the cochain level. Additionally, we present explicit example for a (3+1)D FSPT of symmetry group $G_f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ with Majorana chain decorations.</description>

      <title>On the uplift of 4D wormholes in Braneworld models and their 5D structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments for the consistent embedding of general 4D static and spherically-symmetric spacetimes in arbitrary single-brane braneworld models in the form of the General Embedding Algorithm (GEA) [Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 4, L041501], initiated the program of studying the bulk structure of braneworld wormholes. In this article, adopting a completely generic approach, we derive the general conditions that the metric functions of any braneworld spacetime must satisfy to describe a wormhole structure in the bulk. Particular emphasis is placed on clarifying the proper uplift of 4D spacetimes, expressed in terms of arbitrary radial coordinates on the brane, and we demonstrate the important role of the circumferential radius metric function $r(u)$ for the embedding. To ensure applicability even when $r(u)$ is non-invertible, we develop an extended formulation of the GEA. Additionally, the flare-out conditions for braneworld wormholes are presented for the first time and are found to differ from the case of flat extra dimensions. To illustrate the method, we first perform the uplift into both thin (Randall-Sundrum II) and thick braneworld models for four well-known 4D wormhole spacetimes: the effective braneworld wormhole solutions of Casadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati and Bronnikov-Kim, the Simpson-Visser spacetime, and the Ellis-Bronnikov or "anti-Fisher" solution. Subsequently, we study their bulk features by means of curvature invariants, flare-out conditions, energy conditions and embedding diagrams. Our analysis reveals that the assumption of a warped extra dimension has non-trivial implications for the structure of 5D wormholes.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling from interstellar medium heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In interstellar media characterized by a nonrelativistic plasma of electrons and heavy ions, we study the effect of axion dark matter coupled to photons on the dynamics of an electric field. In particular, we assume the presence of a background magnetic field aligned in a specific direction. We show that there is an energy transfer from the oscillating axion field to photons and then to the plasma induced by forced resonance. This resonance is most prominent for the axion mass $m_{\phi}$ equivalent to the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. Requiring that the heating rate of the interstellar medium caused by the energy transfer does not exceed the observed astrophysical cooling rate, we place forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling $g$ for several different amplitudes of the background magnetic field $B_0$. By choosing a typical value $B_0=10^{-6}$ G, we find that, for the resonance mass $m_{\phi}=\omega_p$, the upper limit of $g$ can be stronger than those derived from other measurements in the literature. With increased values of $B_0$, it is possible to put more stringent constraints on $g$ for a wider range of the axion mass away from the resonance point.</description>

      <title>Covariant analysis of electromagnetic current on the light cone: exposition with scalar Yukawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of the Lorentz covariance of the charge form factor for a strongly coupled scalar theory in (3+1)-dimensions. Our results are based on the first non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa theory with a Fock sector expansion including up to thee-particles (one mock nucleon plus two mock pions or two mock nucleons plus one mock anti-nucleon). The light-front Hamiltonian is constructed and renormalized using a Fock sector dependent scheme. The derived eigenvalue equation is then solved non-perturbatively to obtain the wave functions, which are then used to compute the current matrix element.
  We perform a covariant analysis of the current matrix element taking into account possible violation of the Poincar\'e symmetry due to the Fock sector truncation. The physical form factor depends on two boost invariants $\zeta, \Delta^2_\perp$, instead of the single Lorentz invariant $Q^2$. Instead of adopting the conventional Drell-Yan frame $\zeta = 0$, we evaluate the form factor in general frames, and use the frame dependence to quantitatively gauge the loss of the Lorentz covariance. Our numerical result shows that as more Fock sectors are included, the frame dependence reduces dramatically. In particular, the anti-nucleon degree of freedom plays an important role in the reduction of the frame dependence, even though it only takes a small portion within the state vector. We also find that there is no zero-mode contribution to the current for the scalar Yukawa theory.</description>

      <title>Exact path integrals on half-line in quantum cosmology with a fluid clock and aspects of operator ordering ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform $\textit{exact}$ half-line path integral quantization of flat, homogeneous cosmological models containing a perfect fluid acting as an internal clock, in a $D+1$ dimensional minisuperspace setup. We also discuss certain classes of operator ordering ambiguity inherent in such quantization procedures and argue that a particular ordering prescription in the quantum theory can preserve two symmetries, namely arbitrary lapse rescalings and general covariance, which are already present at the classical level. As a result of this imposition, a large class of quantum Hamiltonians differing by operator ordering produces the same inner products between quantum states. This imposition of the two symmetries of the classical minisuperspace models leads to a unique prescription for writing the quantum Hamiltonian for minisuperspace dimension $D&gt;2$. Interestingly, in the case of $D=1$, the lapse rescaling symmetry is lost in the quantum theory, leading to an essentially ambiguous description of the canonical theory. We provide general proof of this in the context of both canonical quantization and path integrals. We supply concrete examples to validate our findings further.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial component $v_r$ is developed to measure the gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for the high-acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that a gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel systematic framework for engineering energy-momentum tensors in linearized gravity that generate gravitational fields with a prescribed multipolar structure, aimed at modeling black hole mimickers. As a concrete example, we analyze an anisotropic rotating fluid with a Gaussian-like energy-density profile which, at linearized order, satisfies all energy and causality conditions while generating a gravitational field that exactly reproduces the multipolar structure of a Kerr black hole. We then investigate the phenomenology of both the source and the induced metric, comparing our findings with the corresponding black hole limit.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Magnetically Charged Black Holes with Phantom Global Monopoles: Thermodynamics, Geodesics, Quasinormal Modes, and Grey-Body Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a nonlinear magnetic-charged black hole in the presence of a phantom global monopole. By incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) and exotic scalar fields, we derive an exact black hole solution and analyze its geometric structure, causal properties, and thermodynamic behavior. We examine how the presence of a phantom global monopole modifies the black hole's Hawking temperature, entropy, and stability conditions, revealing significant changes in its phase structure. Additionally, we investigate the geodesic motion of test particles. The quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum is computed using the WKB approximation and P\"oschl-Teller potential method, providing insights into the perturbative stability of the system. Furthermore, we analyze the grey-body factors that characterize radiation emission, highlighting their dependence on black hole parameters. Our findings indicate that the interplay between phantom energy, NED, and global monopoles introduces observable deviations in strong-field astrophysical phenomena. These results offer potential signatures for testing modified gravity theories and contribute to a deeper understanding of black hole physics in exotic field environments.</description>

      <title>CoMBolt-ITA, a Collective Model via relativistic Boltzmann equation in Isotropization Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new (2+1)-model is developed to investigate the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This framework couples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the Boltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation. A numerical scheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin from a specified initial Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the spatial structure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework. Our results show that a medium initialized at $\tau_0 $ in the order of 1\,[fm/$c$] with a small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s = 0.008$) evolves consistently with hydrodynamic simulations, such as those performed using the VISH2+1 code, while discrepancies arise for a medium with $\eta/s = 0.8$. Furthermore, when initialized with a highly anisotropic momentum distribution in the longitudinal direction at early times, the system exhibits spatially non-uniform thermalization in the transverse plane, leading to the emergence of a nontrivial hypersurface that marks the onset of hydrodynamic applicability.</description>
