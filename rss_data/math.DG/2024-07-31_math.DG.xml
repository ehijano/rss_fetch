      <title>New Randers metrics defined by the other Randers metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short article, using a left-invariant Randers metric $F$, we define a new left-invariant Randers metric $\tilde{F}$. We show that $F$ is of Berwald (Douglas) type if and only if $\tilde{F}$ is of Berwald (Douglas) type. In the case of Berwaldian metrics, we give the relation between their flag curvatures. Also, we have studied the relations between their base Riemannian metrics. Finally, as examples, the results are studied in the Heisenberg group and almost Abelian Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Topological Obstructions to the Existence of Compact Shrinking Ricci Solitons in Dimension Four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This undergraduate thesis is focused on introducing the reader to concepts related to the search for topological obstructions to the existence of compact gradient shrinking Ricci soliton metrics in dimension four. It contains a discussion of the relevant background material for this subject. Furthermore, it introduces the problem of extending the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality to gradient shrinking Ricci soliton metrics and explores the limitations of current results in that direction. At last, the topic of compact Kaehler gradient shrinking Ricci solitons is introduced and the classification of these spaces is outlined in literature-study fashion.</description>

      <title>Curvature-adapted hypersurfaces of 2-type in non-flat quaternionic space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify curvature-adapted real hypersurfaces $M$ of non-flat quaternionic space forms $\mathbb HP^m$ and $\mathbb HH^m$ that are of Chen type 2 in an appropriately defined (pseudo) Euclidean space of quaternion-Hermitian matrices, where in the hyperbolic case we assume additionally that the hypersurace has constant principal curvatures. In the quaternionic projective space they include geodesic hyperspheres of arbitrary radius $r \in (0, \pi/2)$ except one, two series of tubes about canonically embedded quaternionic projective spaces of lower dimensions and two particular tubes about a canonically embedded $\mathbb CP^m \subset \mathbb HP^m $. On the other hand, the list of 2-type curvature-adapted hypersurfaces with constant principal curvatures in $\mathbb HH^m$ is reduced to geodesic spheres and tubes of arbitrary radius about totally geodesic quaternionic hyperplane $\mathbb HH^{m-1}.$ Among these hypersurfaces we determine those that are mass-symmetric or minimal. We also show that the horosphere $H_3$ in $\mathbb HH^m $ is not of finite type but satisfies $\Delta^2\widetilde x =$ const.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the moduli space of positive scalar curvature concordances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a manifold which admits a metric with positive scalar curvature (or a positive intermediate curvature in a suitable sense). We study the moduli space ${\mathscr{M}}^{{\mathsf{pos}}_*}_{\sqcup}(M\times I)_g$ of concordances of such metrics (with appropriate boundary conditions) which restrict to a given metric $g$ on $M \times \{0\} \cup\partial M \times I$. We show that $\pi_{4*}{\mathscr{M}}^{{\mathsf{pos}}_*}_{\sqcup}(M \times I)_g \otimes {\mathbb Q} \neq 0$ in a stable range provided $\dim M$ is even. We obtain analogous results when positive scalar curvature is replaced by $k$-positive Ricci curvature for $k \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity of spheres with subsets removed and $L^\infty$ metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the scalar curvature rigidity for $L^\infty$ metrics on $\mathbb S^n\backslash\Sigma$, where $\mathbb S^n$ is the $n$-dimensional sphere with $n\geq 3$ and $\Sigma$ is a closed subset of $\mathbb S^n$ of codimension at least $\frac{n}{2}+1$ that satisfies the wrapping property. The notion of wrapping property was introduced by the second author for studying related scalar curvature rigidity problems on spheres. For example, any closed subset of $\mathbb S^n$ contained in a hemisphere and any finite subset of $\mathbb S^n$ satisfy the wrapping property. The same techniques also apply to prove an analogous scalar rigidity result for $L^\infty$ metrics on tori that are smooth away from certain subsets of codimension at least $\frac{n}{2}+1$.</description>

      <title>Dirac eigenvalues and the hyperspherical radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For closed connected Riemannian spin manifolds an upper estimate of the smallest eigenvalue of the Dirac operator in terms of the hyperspherical radius is proved. When combined with known lower Dirac eigenvalue estimates, this has a number of geometric consequences. Some are known and include Llarull's scalar curvature rigidity of the standard metric on the sphere, Geroch's conjecture on the impossibility of positive scalar curvature on tori and and a mean curvature estimate for spin fill-ins with nonnegative scalar curvature due to Gromov, including its rigidity statement recently proved by Cecchini, Hirsch and Zeidler. New applications provide a comparison of the hyperspherical radius with the Yamabe constant and improved estimates of the hyperspherical radius for K\"ahler manifolds, K\"ahler-Einstein manifolds, quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds and manifolds with a harmonic 1-form of constant length.</description>

      <title>Entropy, Thermodynamics and the Geometrization of the Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how pure mathematics and theoretical physics can be applied to the study of language models. Using set theory and analysis, we formulate mathematically rigorous definitions of language models, and introduce the concept of the moduli space of distributions for a language model. We formulate a generalized distributional hypothesis using functional analysis and topology. We define the entropy function associated with a language model and show how it allows us to understand many interesting phenomena in languages. We argue that the zero points of the entropy function and the points where the entropy is close to 0 are the key obstacles for an LLM to approximate an intelligent language model, which explains why good LLMs need billions of parameters. Using the entropy function, we formulate a conjecture about AGI.
  Then, we show how thermodynamics gives us an immediate interpretation to language models. In particular we will define the concepts of partition function, internal energy and free energy for a language model, which offer insights into how language models work. Based on these results, we introduce a general concept of the geometrization of language models and define what is called the Boltzmann manifold. While the current LLMs are the special cases of the Boltzmann manifold.</description>

      <title>Constraint maps: singularities vs free boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-minimizing constraint maps are a natural extension of the obstacle problem within a vectorial framework. Due to inherent topological constraints, these maps manifest a diverse structure that includes singularities similar to harmonic maps, branch points reminiscent of minimal surfaces, and the intricate free-boundary behavior of the obstacle problem. The complexity of these maps poses significant challenges to their analysis.
  In this paper, we first focus on constraint maps with uniformly convex obstacles and establish continuity (and therefore higher-order regularity) within a uniform neighborhood of the free boundary. More precisely, thanks to a new quantitative unique continuation principle near singularities (which is new even in the setting of classical harmonic maps), we prove that, in the uniformly convex setting, topological singularities can only lie in the interior of the contact set. We then establish the optimality of this result.
  Second, while exploring the structure of the free boundary, we investigate the presence of branch points and show how they lead to completely new types of singularities not present in the scalar case.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of equipotential photon surfaces in 4-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes for positive, negative, and zero mass -- and a new partial proof of the Willmore inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present different proofs of the uniqueness of 4-dimensional static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes containing a connected equipotential photon surface or in particular a connected photon sphere. We do not assume that the equipotential photon surface is outward directed or non-degenerate and hence cover not only the positive but also the negative and the zero mass case which has not yet been treated in the literature. Our results partially reproduce and extend beyond results by Cederbaum and by Cederbaum and Galloway. In the positive and negative mass cases, we give three proofs which are based on the approaches to proving black hole uniqueness by Israel, Robinson, and Agostiniani--Mazzieri, respectively. In the zero mass case, we give four proofs. One is based on the positive mass theorem, the second one is inspired by Israel's approach and in particular leads to a new proof of the Willmore inequality in $(\mathbb{R}^3, \delta)$, under a technical assumption. The remaining two proofs are inspired by proofs of the Willmore inequality by Cederbaum and Miehe and by Agostiniani and Mazzieri, respectively. In particular, this suggests to view the Willmore inequality and its rigidity case as a zero mass version of equipotential photon surface uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Vacuum cosmological spacetimes without CMC Cauchy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend a construction of [6] to obtain a large class of vacuum cosmological spacetimes that do not contain any CMC Cauchy surfaces. The allowed spatial topologies for these examples are of the form $M \# M$, where $M$ is any closed, oriented, irreducible $3$-manifold which is not spherical. This complements the recent results of [19], where, instead of initial data methods, global spacetime gluing arguments were used. The study of such examples is sure to yield insight into Bartnik's cosmological splitting conjecture [1].</description>

Abstract: We present an explicit pluripotential (as well as viscosity) solution to the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation with constant right-hand side on $\mathbb D\times\mathbb C^{n-1}\,(n\geq 2)$, which lies merely in $W^{1,2}_{loc}\cap W^{2,1}_{loc}$ and is not even Dini continuous. Additionally, we exhibit two families of explicit entire toric solutions on $\mathbb C^n$ with continuous H\"older exponent $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $W^{2,p}_{loc}$ exponent $p\in (1,2)$.</description>

      <title>A sharp lower bound on the small eigenvalues of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a compact hyperbolic surface of genus $g\geq 2$ and let $I(S) = \frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(S)}\int_{S} \frac{1}{\mathrm{Inj}(x)^2 \wedge 1} dx$, where $\mathrm{Inj}(x)$ is the injectivity radius at $x$. We prove that for any $k\in \{1,\ldots, 2g-3\}$, the $k$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_k$ of the Laplacian satisfies \begin{equation*}
  \lambda_k \geq \frac{c k^2}{I(S) g^2} \, , \end{equation*} where $c&gt;0$ is some universal constant. We use this bound to prove the heat kernel estimate \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(S)} \int_S \Big| p_t(x,x) -\frac{1}{\mathrm{Vol}(S)} \Big | ~dx \leq C \sqrt{ \frac{I(S)}{t}} \qquad \forall t \geq 1 \, , \end{equation*} where $C&lt;\infty$ is some universal constant. These bounds are optimal in the sense that for every $g\geq 2$ there exists a compact hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ satisfying the reverse inequalities with different constants.</description>

      <title>Zoll magnetic systems on the two-torus: a Nash-Moser construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an infinite-dimensional family of smooth integrable magnetic systems on the two-torus which are Zoll, meaning that all the unit-speed magnetic geodesics are periodic. The metric and the magnetic field of such systems are arbitrarily close to the flat metric and to a given constant magnetic field. This extends to the magnetic setting a famous result by Guillemin on the two-sphere. We characterize Zoll magnetic systems as zeros of a suitable action functional $S$, and then look for its zeros by means of a Nash-Moser implicit function theorem. This requires showing the right-invertibility of the linearized operator $\mathrm{d} S$ in a neighborhood of the flat metric and constant magnetic field, and establishing tame estimates for the right inverse. As key step we prove the invertibility of the normal operator $\mathrm{d} S\circ \mathrm{d} S^*$ which, unlike in Guillemin's case, is pseudo-differential only at the highest order. We overcome this difficulty noting that, by the asymptotic properties of Bessel functions, the lower order expansion of $\mathrm{d} S \circ \mathrm{d}S^*$ is a sum of Fourier integral operators. We then use a resolvent identity decomposition which reduces the problem to the invertibility of $\mathrm{d} S \circ \mathrm{d} S^*$ restricted to the subspace of functions corresponding to high Fourier modes. The inversion of such a restricted operator is finally achieved by making the crucial observation that lower order Fourier integral operators satisfy asymmetric tame estimates.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of complete, properly embedded, annular translators $M$ such that $M$ lies in a slab and is invariant under reflections in the vertical coordinate planes. Each translator in the family is asymptotic as $z\to -\infty$ to four vertical planes $\{y= \pm b\}$ and $\{y= \pm B\}$, where $0&lt;b \le B &lt; \infty$. We call $b$ and $B$ the inner width and the (outer) width of the translator. We show that for each $b \ge \pi/2$ and each $s&gt;0$, there is a translator in the family with inner width $b$ and with necksize $s$. (We also show that there are no translators with inner width $&lt;\pi/2$ having the properties of the examples we construct.)</description>

      <title>Untwisted Gromov-Witten invariants of Riemann-Finsler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a $\mathbb{Q}$-valued deformation invariant of certain complete Riemann-Finsler manifolds, in particular of complete Riemannian manifolds with non positive sectional curvature. It is proved that every rational number is the value of this invariant for some compact Riemannian manifold. We use this to find the first and mostly sharp generalizations, to non-compact products and fibrations, of Preissman's theorem on non-existence of negative sectional curvature metrics on compact products. For example, $\Sigma \times T ^{n}$ admits a metric of negative sectional curvature, where $\Sigma$ is a non-compact possibly infinite type surface, if and only if $\Sigma$ has genus zero. We also give novel estimates on counts of closed geodesics with restrictions on multiplicity. Along the way, we also prove that sky catastrophes of smooth dynamical systems are not geodesible by a certain class of forward complete Riemann-Finsler metrics, in particular by complete Riemannian metrics with non-positive sectional curvature. This partially answers a question of Fuller and gives important examples for our theory here.</description>

      <title>On the H-type deviation of step two Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The H-type deviation, $\delta({\mathbb G})$, of a step two Carnot group ${\mathbb G}$ quantifies the extent to which ${\mathbb G}$ deviates from the geometrically and algebraically tractable class of Heisenberg-type (H-type) groups. In an earlier paper, the author defined this notion and used it to provide new analytic characterizations for the class of H-type groups. In addition, a quantitative conjecture relating the H-type deviation to the behavior of the $\infty$-Laplacian of Folland's fundamental solution for the $2$-Laplacian was formulated; an affirmative answer to this conjecture would imply that all step two polarizable groups are of H-type. In this paper, we elucidate further properties of the H-type deviation. First, we show that $0\le \delta({\mathbb G}) \le 1$ for all step two Carnot groups ${\mathbb G}$. Recalling that $\delta({\mathbb F}_{2,m}) = \sqrt{(m-2)/m}$, where ${\mathbb F}_{2,m}$ is the free step two Carnot group of rank $m$, we conjecture that $\delta({\mathbb G}) \le \sqrt{(m-2)/m}$ for all step two rank $m$ groups. We explicitly compute $\delta({\mathbb G})$ when ${\mathbb G}$ is a product of Heisenberg groups and verify the conjectural upper bound for such groups, with equality if and only if ${\mathbb G}$ factors over the first Heisenberg group. We also prove the following rigidity statement: for each $m \ge 3$ there exists $\delta_0(m)&gt;0$ so that if ${\mathbb G}$ is a step two and rank $m$ Carnot group with $\delta({\mathbb G}) &lt; \delta_0(m)$, then ${\mathbb G}$ enjoys certain algebraic properties characteristic of H-type groups.</description>

Abstract: For a given closed two-form, we introduce the cone Yang-Mills functional which is a Yang-Mills-type functional for a pair $(A,B)$, a connection one-form $A$ and a scalar $B$ taking value in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. The functional arises naturally from dimensionally reducing the Yang-Mills functional over the fiber of a circle bundle with the two-form being the Euler class. We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present some of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with Yang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional solutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole equations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills functional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal bundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Tracking Control for $(x,u)$-Flat Systems by Quasi-Static Feedback of Classical States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.12995v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that for flat systems the tracking control problem can be solved by utilizing a linearizing quasi-static feedback of generalized states. If measurements (or estimates) of a so-called generalized Brunovsk\'y state are available, a linear, decoupled and asymptotically stable tracking error dynamics can be achieved. However, from a practical point of view, it is often desirable to achieve the same tracking error dynamics by feedback of a classical state instead of a generalized one. This is due to the fact that the components of a classical state typically correspond to measurable physical quantities, whereas a generalized Brunovsk\'y state often contains higher order time derivatives of the (fictitious) flat output which are not directly accessible by measurements. In this paper, a systematic solution for the tracking control problem based on quasi-static feedback and measurements of classical states only is derived for the subclass of $(x,u)$-flat systems.</description>

      <title>The constraint tensor for null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a definition of the constraint tensor of a null hypersurface data which is completely explicit in the extrinsic geometry of the hypersurface. The definition is fully covariant and applies for any topology of the hypersurface. For data embedded in a spacetime, the constraint tensor coincides with the pull-back of the ambient Ricci tensor. As applications of the results, we find three geometric quantities on any transverse submanifold $S$ of the data with remarkably simple gauge behaviour, and prove that the restriction of the constraint tensor to $S$ takes a very simple form in terms of them. We also obtain an identity that generalizes the standard near horizon equation of isolated horizons to totally geodesic null hypersurfaces with any topology. Finally, we prove that when a null hypersurface has product topology, its extrinsic curvature can be uniquely reconstructed from the constraint tensor plus suitable initial data on a cross-section.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Method to Fundamental gap problems on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a probabilistic proof of the fundamental gap estimate for Schr\"odinger operators in convex domains on the sphere, which extends the probabilistic proof of F. Gong, H. Li, and D. Luo for the Euclidean case. Our results further generalize the results achieved for the Laplacian by S. Seto, L. Wang, and G. Wei, as well as by C. He, G. Wei, and Qi S. Zhang. The essential ingredient in our analysis is the reflection coupling method on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Manifold learning in Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at building the theoretical foundations for manifold learning algorithms in the space of absolutely continuous probability measures on a compact and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, metrized with the Wasserstein-2 distance $\mathrm{W}$. We begin by introducing a construction of submanifolds $\Lambda$ of probability measures equipped with metric $\mathrm{W}_\Lambda$, the geodesic restriction of $W$ to $\Lambda$. In contrast to other constructions, these submanifolds are not necessarily flat, but still allow for local linearizations in a similar fashion to Riemannian submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show how the latent manifold structure of $(\Lambda,\mathrm{W}_{\Lambda})$ can be learned from samples $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$ of $\Lambda$ and pairwise extrinsic Wasserstein distances $\mathrm{W}$ only. In particular, we show that the metric space $(\Lambda,\mathrm{W}_{\Lambda})$ can be asymptotically recovered in the sense of Gromov--Wasserstein from a graph with nodes $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and edge weights $W(\lambda_i,\lambda_j)$. In addition, we demonstrate how the tangent space at a sample $\lambda$ can be asymptotically recovered via spectral analysis of a suitable "covariance operator" using optimal transport maps from $\lambda$ to sufficiently close and diverse samples $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$. The paper closes with some explicit constructions of submanifolds $\Lambda$ and numerical examples on the recovery of tangent spaces through spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Examples of cosmological spacetimes without CMC Cauchy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CMC (constant mean curvature) Cauchy surfaces play an important role in mathematical relativity as finding solutions to the vacuum Einstein constraint equations is made much simpler by assuming CMC initial data. However, in [2] Bartnik constructed a cosmological spacetime without a CMC Cauchy surface whose spatial topology is the connected sum of two three-dimensional tori. Similarly, in [9], Chru\'sciel, Isenberg, and Pollack constructed a vacuum cosmological spacetime without CMC Cauchy surfaces whose spatial topology was also the connected sum of two tori. In this article, we enlarge the known number of spatial topologies for cosmological spacetimes without CMC Cauchy surfaces by generalizing Bartnik's construction. Specifically, we show that there are cosmological spacetimes without CMC Cauchy surfaces whose spatial topologies are the connected sum of any compact oriented Euclidean or hyperbolic three-manifold with any another compact oriented Euclidean or hyperbolic three-manifold. We work with the Tolman-Bondi class of metrics and prove gluing results for variable marginal conditions, which allows for smooth gluing of Schwarzschild to FLRW models.</description>
