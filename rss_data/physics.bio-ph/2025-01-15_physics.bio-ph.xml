      <title>Active and passive crosslinking of cytoskeleton scaffolds tune the effects of cell inclusions on composite structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating cells within active biomaterial scaffolds is a promising strategy to develop forefront materials that can autonomously sense, respond, and alter the scaffold in response to environmental cues or internal cell circuitry. Using dynamic biocompatible scaffolds that can self-alter their properties via crosslinking and motor-driven force-generation opens even greater avenues for actuation and control. However, the design principles associated with engineering active scaffolds embedded with cells are not well established. To address this challenge, we design a dynamic scaffold material of bacteria cells embedded within a composite cytoskeletal network of actin and microtubules that can be passively or actively crosslinked by either biotin-streptavidin or multimeric kinesin motors. Using quantitative microscopy, we demonstrate the ability to embed cells of volume fractions 0.4 to 2% throughout the network without compromising the structural integrity of the network or inhibiting crosslinking or motor-driven dynamics. Our findings suggest that both passive and active crosslinking promote entrainment of cells within the network, while depletion interactions play a more important role in uncrosslinked networks. Moreover, we show that large-scale structures emerge with the addition of cell fractions as low as 0.4%, but these structures do not influence the microscale structural lengthscale of the materials. Our work highlights the potential of our composite biomaterial in designing autonomous materials controlled by cells, and provides a roadmap for effectively coupling cells to complex composite materials with an eye towards using cells as in situ factories to program material modifications.</description>

      <title>Correlation Between DNA Double-Strand Break Distribution in 3D Genome and Radiation-Induced Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The target theory is the most classical hypothesis explaining radiation-induced cell death, yet the physical or biological nature of the "target" remains ambiguous. This study hypothesizes that the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome is a pivotal factor affecting the probability of radiation-induced cell death. We propose that clustered DSBs in DNA segments with high interaction frequencies are more susceptible to leading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domain (TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB clustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB distribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we constructed a model that abstracts DNA interactions on the aspect of TADs. Utilizing track-structure Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated the incidence of each DSB case across a variety of radiation doses and linear energy transfers (LETs). Our simulation results suggest that clustered DSBs in a single TAD or distributed in TADs with frequent interaction are substantially more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs. These two DSB cases are also associated with cell death and the stochastic effects caused by high-LET irradiation. Our study highlights the critical role of the 3D genome structure in the underlying mechanisms of radiobiological effects. Our hypothesis contributes novel insights into the mechanisms governing radiobiological effects and provides a valuable reference for the development of mechanistic models capable of predicting cell survival under varying doses and LETs.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics-driven phase-locking and collective motility of sessile active dumbbells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective motion is a phenomenon observed across length scales in nature, from bacterial swarming and tissue migration to the flocking of animals. The mechanisms underlying this behavior vary significantly depending on the biological system, ranging from hydrodynamic and chemical interactions in bacteria to mechanical forces in epithelial tissues and social alignment in animal groups. While collective motion often arises from the coordinated activity of independently motile agents, this work explores a novel context: the emergence of collective motion in systems of non-motile active agents. Inspired by the oscillatory shape dynamics observed in suspended cells such as neutrophils and fibroblasts, we model active dumbbells exhibiting limit-cycle oscillations in shape as a minimal representation of such systems.Through computational simulations, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic interactions between these dumbbells lead to three key phenomena: a density-dependent transition from sessile to collective motion, hydrodynamics-induced phase separation, and synchronization of oscillatory shape changes. We have explored the role of hydrodynamic interactions on these emergent properties of sessile active dumbbells. These results underscore the critical role of hydrodynamic coupling in enabling and organizing collective behaviors in systems lacking intrinsic motility. This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the emergent behavior of active matter and its implications for understanding cell motility, tissue dynamics, and the development of bio-inspired materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using as a narrative theme the example of Darwin's finches, a microscopic agent-based model is introduces to study sympatric speciation as a result of competition for resources in the same ecological niche. Varying competition among individuals and resource distribution, the model exhibits some of the main features of evolutionary branching processing. The model can be extended to include spatial effects, different genetic loci, sexual mating and recombination, etc.</description>

      <title>Single-step method for the immobilization of hydroxyapatite on 3D-printed porous polyetherketoneketone implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of tissue engineering structures (scaffolds) for the reconstruction of bone tissue defects is the relevant task of modern biomedical materials science. Compared to metal-based structures, polymer constructs provide numerous advantages, among them - better processibility and metallosis avoidance. Owing to its high mechanical performance and biocompatibility, polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) became a promising material for the development of such structures. Previously, a method for the immobilization of hydroxyapatite (HAp) on PEKK surface was proposed by our group for the enhancement of stem cell adhesion. In the present study, we propose a single-step method of HAp immobilization on the surface of 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. The proposed approach allowed to preserve the morphology (pore diameter, width of the printed lines) of the pristine implants. With that, up to 35.0+-14.0 % of the sample surface were coated with HAp particles, which resulted in improved hydrophilicity (0 degrees water contact angle). The calcium and phosphorus content on the surface of the modified samples was up to 17.4+-4.1 and 8.0+-1.7 wt. %, respectively. Importantly, the proposed modification preserved compressive strength of the 3D-printed porous PEKK implants. HAp immobilization provided better adhesion of stem cells (from 121+-40 cells/mm2 to 234+-8 cells/mm2) and induce their osteogenic differentiation.</description>

      <title>Cell-level modelling of homeostasis in confined epithelial monolayers</title>

Abstract: Tissue homeostasis, the biological process of maintaining a steady state in tissue via control of cell proliferation, death, and metabolic function, is essential for the development, growth, maintenance, and proper function of living organisms. Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and even death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level description of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue microenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in confined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance between cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising homeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count distribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue growth. This work, therefore, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and highlights the importance of mechanics in the control of biological processes such as tissue development and disease pathology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Resolution Microscopy (SRM) is emerging as a powerful and innovative tool for imaging, characterizing, and understanding the structure of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs). By addressing the need for single-particle analysis with the high resolution required to study the composition and organization of these nanoparticles, SRM provides unique insights into EV biology. However, its application is accompanied by significant challenges, ranging from experimental setup to data analysis. This review outlines the fundamentals of SRM and its position within the broader field of EV research. We then explore its applications in evaluating (i) the morphological structure of EVs, (ii) their molecular composition, and (iii) their roles in biological systems. By offering practical guidance and an overview of critical parameters for standardization, this review aims at providing researchers with the tools and insights necessary to effectively apply SRM to EV investigation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Dipolar Activity: Quadrupolar Stress Drives Collapse of Nematic Order on Frictional Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of active nematics has traditionally employed descriptions based on dipolar activity, with interactions that align along a single axis. However, it has been theoretically predicted that interactions with a substrate, prevalent in most biological systems, would require novel forms of activity, such as quadrupolar activity, that are governed by hydrodynamic screening. Here, by combining experiments and numerical simulations, we show that upon light-induced solidification of the underlying medium, microtubule-kinesin mixtures undergo a transformation that leads to a biphasic active suspension. Using an active lyotropic model, we prove that the transition is governed by screening effects that alter the dominant form of active stress. Specifically, the combined effect of friction and quadrupolar activity leads to a hierarchical folding that follows the intrinsic bend instability of the active nematic layer. Our results demonstrate the dynamics of the collapse of orientational order in active nematics and present a new route for controlling active matter by modifying the activity through changing the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in statistical physics. Here, we prove a novel universal bound stating that the response precision for state observable is fundamentally constrained to $1/2$ under single edge or vertex perturbations, independent of system size. Furthermore, we develop exact relations connecting responses to perturbations of arbitrary strengths, extending nonequilibrium response theory beyond the weak-perturbation regime. Through response equalities we also provide a novel physical interpretation of response sensitivity and recovers bounds previously obtained using graph-theoretical methods and extensive linear algebra. Our results provide a general mathematical framework applicable across diverse nonequilibrium systems and offer design principles for optimal sensing and information processing in biochemical systems.</description>
