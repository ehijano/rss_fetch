      <title>A unified framework for semiclassical reaction rate theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general semiclassical theory for the calculation of reaction rate constants is developed. The theory can be understood as a formal framework that encompasses existing semiclassical methods: instanton theory and semiclassical transition state theory (SCTST). Unlike SCTST, the present formalism does not start from the concept of "good" action-angle variables. Instead, it is based on a conjectured connection between the cumulative reaction probability and the instanton contribution to the formally exact generalisation of Gutzwiller's formula for the trace of the Green's function. The formalism effectively generalises the "imaginary free-energy" formulation of instanton theory to microcanonical scattering rates and all orders in $\hbar$. In one dimension, explicit expressions are derived for the generalised reduced action up to $O(\hbar^4)$ using exact WKB/quantum Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The connection between the present formalism and the standard second order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) version of SCTST is explored. It is also shown that the standard thermal instanton rate theory, as well as higher order (dividing surface independent) "perturbative" corrections can be straightforwardly derived from the framework. Above the crossover temperature, first-order corrections in $\hbar$ to the parabolic barrier ("sphaleron") rate are also derived. A simple anharmonic transition state theory and anharmonic version of the Wigner tunneling correction are presented. Finally, the potential for the development of new and improved semiclassical methods for modelling reaction kinetics is discussed.</description>

      <title>Systematic improvement of trial states in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the use of coupled cluster (CC) trial states in the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method beyond single and double excitations to include both triple and quadruple excitations. With this AFQMC/CC hierarchy, we are able to systematically benchmark the method's performance on molecular systems as the quality of the trial is improved. Our results show that the phaseless AFQMC energy improves systematically and is typically significantly more accurate than the energy of the underlying trial state. However, the relative improvement compared to the trial CC energy decreases as we ascend the CC hierarchy. As the CC wavefunction is usually further approximated when used as an AFQMC trial, we also explore the relationship between the components of the CC wavefunction and the resulting AFQMC/CC error. Our results suggest that improving the representation of the CC wave function in the AFQMC trial does not always lower the bias even when it increases the fidelity of the trial with the exact ground state.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Foundation Neural Network Models using Multiple Time-Step and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strategy to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. To do so, we apply a dual-level neural network multi-time-step (MTS) strategy where the target accurate potential is coupled to a simpler but faster model obtained via a distillation process. Thus, the 3.5 \r{A}-cutoff distilled model is sufficient to capture the fast varying forces, i.e. mainly bonded interactions, from the accurate potential allowing its use in a reversible reference system propagator algorithms (RESPA)-like formalism. The approach conserves accuracy, preserving both static and dynamical properties, while enabling to evaluate the costly model only every 3 to 6 fs depending on the system. Consequently, large simulation speedups over standard 1 fs integration are observed: 4-fold in homogeneous systems and 2.3-fold in large solvated proteins. Such a strategy is applicable to any neural network potential and reduces their performance gap with classical force fields.</description>

      <title>Effective Core Potentials for calculations of continuum spectra of molecules using the molecular R-matrix method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementation of Effective Core Potentials (ECPs) into the molecular scattering suite UKRmol+ is presented together with a set of calculations for a range of targets relevant for plasma modeling. Continuum description in scattering and photoionization calculations for large targets or high-energy electrons often requires the use of numerical continuum functions and the associated molecular integrals. We derive expressions for ECP integrals over B-spline type orbitals using their momentum-space representation and describe their implementation. Sample calculations are presented for electron collision from bromine molecule (Br$_2$), silicon tetrabromide (SiBr$_4$) and tungsten hydride (WH) as well as photoionisation of methyl iodide (CH$_3$I).</description>

      <title>Quantum matrix arithmetics with Hamiltonian evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient implementation of matrix arithmetic operations underpins the speedups of many quantum algorithms. We develop a suite of methods to perform matrix arithmetics -- with the result encoded in the off-diagonal blocks of a Hamiltonian -- using Hamiltonian evolutions of input operators. We show how to maintain this $\textit{Hamiltonian block encoding}$, so that matrix operations can be composed one after another, and the entire quantum computation takes $\leq 2$ ancilla qubits. We achieve this for matrix multiplication, matrix addition, matrix inversion, Hermitian conjugation, fractional scaling, integer scaling, complex phase scaling, as well as singular value transformation for both odd and even polynomials. We also present an overlap estimation algorithm to extract classical properties of Hamiltonian block encoded operators, analogous to the well known Hadmard test, at no extra cost of qubit. Our Hamiltonian matrix multiplication uses the Lie group commutator product formula and its higher-order generalizations due to Childs and Wiebe. Our Hamiltonian singular value transformation employs a dominated polynomial approximation, where the approximation holds within the domain of interest, while the constructed polynomial is upper bounded by the target function over the entire unit interval. We describe a circuit for simulating a class of sum-of-squares Hamiltonians, attaining a commutator scaling in step count, while leveraging the power of matrix arithmetics to reduce the cost of each simulation step. In particular, we apply this to the doubly factorized tensor hypercontracted Hamiltonians from recent studies of quantum chemistry, obtaining further improvements for initial states with a fixed number of particles. We achieve this with $1$ ancilla qubit.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Effects in a Molecular Quantum NAND Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules provide the smallest possible circuits in which quantum interference and electron correlation can be engineered to perform logical operations, including the universal NAND gate. We investigate a chemically encoded quantum NAND tree based on alkynyl-extended iso-polyacetylene backbones, where inputs are set by end-group substitution and outputs are read from the presence or absence of transmission nodes. Using quantum many-body transport theory, we show that NAND behavior persists in the presence of dynamic correlations, but that the nodal positions and their chemical shifts depend sensitively on electron-electron interactions. This sensitivity highlights the potential of these systems not only to probe the strength of electronic correlations but also to harness them in shaping logical response. The thermopower is identified as a chemically robust readout of gate logic, providing discrimination margins that greatly exceed typical experimental uncertainties, in an observable governed primarily by the variation of transport rather than its absolute magnitude.</description>

      <title>Real-Space Quantification of Exciton Localization in Acene Crystals Using Wannier Function Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Wannier function decomposition of excitons (WFDX) method to quantify exciton localization in solids within the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation framework. By decomposing each Bloch exciton wavefunction into products of single-particle electron and hole maximally localized Wannier functions, this real-space approach provides well-defined orbital- and spatial- resolved measures of both Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons at low computational cost. We apply WFDX to excitons in acene crystals, quantifying how the number of rings, the exciton spin state, and the center-of-mass momntum affect spatial localization. Additionally, we show how this real-space representation reflects structural nonsymmorphic symmetries that are hidden in standard reciprocal-space descriptions. We demonstrate how the WFDX framework can be used to efficiently interpolate exciton expansion coefficients in reciprocal-space and outline how it may facilitate evaluation of observables involving position operators, highlighting its potential as a general tool for both analyzing and computing excitonic properties in solids.</description>

      <title>SAOS and LAOS rheology for differentiating chemical and physical crosslinking: A case study on PVA hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the viscoelastic behavior of chemically and physically crosslinked Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels near the critical gel point (GP) as well as further away from it, by means of small amplitude (SAOS) and large amplitude (LAOS) oscillatory shear experiments. Chemical crosslinking involved covalent bonding by means of glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker, while physical crosslinking was induced by freeze-thaw cycles. SAOS data analysis allowed evaluation of critical parameters such as the critical relaxation exponent n, gel strength S, and equilibrium modulus Ge, based on the dynamic self-similarity and fractal network structures at the GP. LAOS rheological data analysis showed that the chemically crosslinked system exhibited moderate strain-dependance due to the permanent covalent bonds, whereas the physically crosslinked system displayed significant strain-dependent nonlinearity due to strain dependent interactions at the crosslink entities. LAOS experiments, supported by Chebyshev coefficients and Lissajous-Bowditch plots, highlighted pronounced differences in nonlinear responses, underscoring the influence of crosslinking mechanisms on the network rheological behavior. The findings establish LAOS as a powerful tool for differentiating polymeric network structures, providing insights beyond those attained by conventional linear rheology. 50 pages 1 figures</description>

      <title>How Semilocal Are Semilocal Density Functional Approximations? -Tackling Self-Interaction Error in One-Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-interaction error (SIE), arising from the imperfect cancellation of the spurious classical Coulomb interaction between an electron and itself, is a persistent challenge in modern density functional approximations. This issue is illustrated using the prototypical one-electron system $H_2^+$. While significant efforts have been made to eliminate SIE through the development of computationally expensive nonlocal density functionals, it is equally important to explore whether SIE can be mitigated within the framework of more efficient semilocal density functionals. In this study, we present a non-empirical meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that incorporates the Laplacian of the electron density. Our results demonstrate that the meta-GGA significantly reduces SIE, yielding a binding energy curve for $H_2^+$ that matches the exact solution at equilibrium and improves across a broad range of bond lengths over those of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed (SCAN) semilocal density functionals. This advancement paves the way for further development within the realm of semilocal approximations.</description>
