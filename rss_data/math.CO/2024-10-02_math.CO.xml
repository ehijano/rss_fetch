      <title>On Chip-Firing on Undirected Binary Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chip-firing is a combinatorial game played on an undirected graph in which we place chips on vertices. We study chip-firing on an infinite binary tree in which we add a self-loop to the root to ensure each vertex has degree 3. A vertex can fire if the number of chips placed on it is at least its degree. In our case, a vertex can fire if it has at least 3 chips, and it fires by dispersing $1$ chip to each neighbor. Motivated by a 2023 paper by Musiker and Nguyen on this setting of chip-firing, we give an upper bound for the number of stable configurations when we place $2^\ell - 1$ labeled chips at the root. When starting with $N$ chips at the root where $N$ is a positive integer, we determine the number of times each vertex fires when $N$ is not necessarily of the form $2^\ell - 1$. We also calculate the total number of fires in this case.</description>

      <title>Rook matroids and log-concavity of $P$-Eulerian polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study rook matroids, the bases of which correspond to non-nesting rook placements on a skew Ferrers board. We show that rook matroids are closed under taking duals, direct sums but not minors. Rook matroids are also transversal, positroids and bear a subtle relationship to lattice path matroids that centers around not having the quaternary matroid $Q_{6}$ as a minor. The enumerative and distributional properties of non-nesting rook placements stand in contrast to that of usual rook placements: the non-nesting rook polynomial is not real-rooted in general, and is instead ultra-log-concave. We leverage this property together with a correspondence between rook placements and linear extensions of a poset to show that if $P$ is a naturally labeled width two poset, then the $P$-Eulerian polynomial $W_{P}$ is ultra-log-concave. This takes an important step towards resolving a log-concavity conjecture of Brenti (1989) and completes the story of the Neggers--Stanley conjecture for naturally labeled width two posets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_p^2$ be a set of size $2p+1$ for prime $p\geq 5$. In this paper, we prove that $A\hat{+}A=\{a_1+a_2\mid a_1,a_2\in A, a_1\neq a_2\}$ has cardinality at least $4p$. This result is the first advancement in over two decades on a variant of the Erd\H{o}s-Heilbronn problem studied by Eliahou and Kervaire.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to phase transitions in random graph isomorphism problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two independent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, with possibly different parameters, and study two isomorphism problems, a graph embedding problem and a common subgraph problem. Under certain conditions on the graph parameters we show a sharp asymptotic phase transition as the graph sizes tend to infinity. This extends known results for the case of uniform Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our approach is primarily combinatorial, naturally leading to several related problems for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of a dissimilarity measure for pairs of draws from discrete probability vectors on finite sets of objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a problem in population genetics, we examine the combinatorics of dissimilarity for pairs of random unordered draws of multiple objects, with replacement, from a collection of distinct objects. Consider two draws of size $K$ taken with replacement from a set of $I$ objects, where the two draws represent samples from potentially distinct probability distributions over the set of $I$ objects. We define the set of \emph{identity states} for pairs of draws via a series of actions by permutation groups, describing the enumeration of all such states for a given $K \geq 2$ and $I \geq 2$. Given two probability vectors for the $I$ objects, we compute the probability of each identity state. From the set of all such probabilities, we obtain the expectation for a dissimilarity measure, finding that it has a simple form that generalizes a result previously obtained for the case of $K=2$. We determine when the expected dissimilarity between two draws from the same probability distribution exceeds that of two draws taken from different probability distributions. We interpret the results in the setting of the genetics of polyploid organisms, those whose genetic material contains many copies of the genome ($K &gt; 2$).</description>

      <title>Connected components and non-bipartiteness of generalized Paley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the class of Cayley graphs known as generalized Paley graphs (GP-graphs for short) given by $\Gamma(k,q) = Cay(\mathbb{F}_q, \{x^k : x\in \mathbb{F}_q^* \})$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is a finite field with $q$ elements, both in the directed and undirected case. Hence $q=p^m$ with $p$ prime, $m\in \mathbb{N}$ and one can assume that $k\mid q-1$. We first give the connected components of an arbitrary GP-graph. We show that these components are smaller GP-graphs all isomorphic to each other (generalizing a Lim and Praeger's result from 2009 to the directed case). We then characterize those GP-graphs which are disjoint unions of odd cycles. Finally, we show that $\Gamma(k,q)$ is non-bipartite except for the graphs $\Gamma(k,2^m)$, $m \in \mathbb{N}$, which are isomorphic to $K_2 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup K_2$, the disjoint union of $2^{m-1}$ copies of $K_2$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Extremal Graphs of Planar Graphs with Fixed Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tait and Tobin [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 126 (2017) 137--161] determined the unique spectral extremal graph over all outerplanar graphs and the unique spectral extremal graph over all planar graphs when the number of vertices is sufficiently large. In this paper we consider the spectral extremal problems of outerplanar graphs and planar graphs with fixed number of edges. We prove that the outerplanar graph on $m \geq 64$ edges with the maximum spectral radius is $S_m$, where $S_m$ is a star with $m$ edges. For planar graphs with $m$ edges, our main result shows that the spectral extremal graph is $K_2 \vee \frac{m-1}{2} K_1$ when $m$ is odd and sufficiently large, and $K_1 \vee (S_{\frac{m-2}{2}} \cup K_1)$ when $m$ is even and sufficiently large. Additionally, we obtain spectral extremal graphs for path, cycle and matching in outerplanar graphs and spectral extremal graphs for path, cycle and complete graph on $4$ vertices in planar graphs.</description>

      <title>The HOMFLY Polynomial of a Forest Quiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the HOMFLY polynomial of a forest quiver $Q$ using a recursive definition on the underlying graph of the quiver. We then show that this polynomial is equal to the HOMFLY polynomial of any plabic link which comes from a connected plabic graph whose quiver is $Q$. We also prove a closed-form expression for the Alexander polynomial of a forest quiver, which is a specialization of the HOMFLY polynomial.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Minor Characterization of 3-Fold-3-Splitting of Binary Gammoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The r-fold-n-point-splitting operation is an important operation in Graph Theory defined by Slater [15]. Later, Ghafari [6] extended 3-fold-n-point-splitting operation in binary matroids and obtained the result for Eulerian matroids whose 3-fold is Eulerian. In this paper, we give another approach to extend 3-fold-3-point-splitting in binary matroids in terms of splitting and haracterize binary gammoid whose 3-fold-3-point spitting is binary gammoid.</description>

      <title>$k$-local Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017 Day et al. introduced the notion of locality as a structural complexity-measure for patterns in the field of pattern matching established by Angluin in 1980. In 2019 Casel et al. showed that determining the locality of an arbitrary pattern is NP-complete. Inspired by hierarchical clustering, we extend the notion to coloured graphs, i.e., given a coloured graph determine an enumeration of the colours such that colouring the graph stepwise according to the enumeration leads to as few clusters as possible. Next to first theoretical results on graph classes, we propose a priority search algorithm to compute the $k$-locality of a graph. The algorithm is optimal in the number of marking prefix expansions, and is faster by orders of magnitude than an exhaustive search. Finally, we perform a case study on a DBLP subgraph to demonstrate the potential of $k$-locality for knowledge discovery.</description>

      <title>The combinatorial structure and value distributions of plateaued functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study combinatorial properties of plateaued functions. All quadratic functions, bent functions and most known APN functions are plateaued, so many cryptographic primitives rely on plateaued functions as building blocks. The main focus of our study is the interplay of the Walsh transform and linearity of a plateaued function, its differential properties, and their value distributions, i.e., the sizes of image and preimage sets. In particular, we study the special case of ``almost balanced'' plateaued functions, which only have two nonzero preimage set sizes, generalizing for instance all monomial functions. We achieve several direct connections and (non)existence conditions for these functions, showing for instance that plateaued $d$-to-$1$ functions (and thus plateaued monomials) only exist for a very select choice of $d$, and we derive for all these functions their linearity as well as bounds on their differential uniformity. We also specifically study the Walsh transform of plateaued APN functions and their relation to their value distribution.</description>

      <title>A strengthening on consecutive odd cycles in graphs of given minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liu and Ma [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2018] conjectured that every $2$-connected non-bipartite graph with minimum degree at least $k+1$ contains $\lceil k/2\rceil $ cycles with consecutive odd lengths. In particular, they showed that this conjecture holds when $k$ is even. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture for any $k\in \mathbb N$. Moreover, we also improve some previous results about cycles of consecutive lengths.</description>

      <title>Dimension vectors of $\tau$-rigid modules and $f$-vectors of cluster monomials from triangulated surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}$ associated with a triangulated surface, we give a characterization of the triangulated surface such that different non-initial cluster monomials in $\mathcal{A}$ have different $f$-vectors. Similarly, for the associated Jacobian algebra $J$, we give a characterization of the triangulated surface such that different $\tau$-rigid $J$-modules have different dimension vectors. Moreover, we also show that different basic support $\tau$-tilting $J$-modules have different dimension vectors. Our main ingredient is a notion of intersection numbers defined by Qiu and Zhou. As an application, we show that the denominator conjecture holds for $\mathcal{A}$ if the marked surface is a closed surface with exactly one puncture, or the given tagged triangulation has neither loops nor tagged arcs connecting punctures.</description>

      <title>FPT Algorithms for Crossing Number Problems: A Unified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic crossing number problem is to determine the minimum number of crossings in a topological drawing of an input graph in the plane. In this paper, we develop fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for various generalized crossing number problems in the plane or on surfaces.
  Our first result is on the color-constrained crossing problem, in which edges of the input graph G are colored, and one looks for a drawing of G in the plane or on a given surface in which the total number of crossings involving edges of colors i and j does not exceed a given upper bound Mij. We give an algorithm for this problem that is FPT in the total number of crossings allowed and the genus of the surface. It readily implies an FPT algorithm for the joint crossing number problem.
  We also give new FPT algorithms for several other graph drawing problems, such as the skewness, the edge crossing number, the splitting number, the gap-planar crossing number, and their generalizations to surfaces. Our algorithms are reductions to the embeddability of a graph on a two-dimensional simplicial complex, which admits an FPT algorithm by a result of Colin de Verdi\`ere and Magnard [ESA 2021].</description>

      <title>Exotic Spaltenstein varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new family of algebraic varieties, called exotic Spaltenstein varieties. These generalise the notion of Spaltenstein varieties (which are the partial flag analogues to classical Springer fibres) to the case of exotic Springer fibres. We show that, for self-adjoint nilpotent endomorphisms of order two, the top-dimensional irreducible components are in bijection with semi-standard Young bitableaux, via constructing an explicit map. Moreover, we are able to give a combinatorial formula for this top dimension. We conjecture that this description of the irreducible components holds for nilpotent endomorphisms of arbitrary order. Finally, we mention some connections to the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note reformulates certain classical combinatorial duality theorems in the context of order lattices. For source-target networks, we generalize bottleneck path-cut and flow-cut duality results to edges with capacities in a distributive lattice. For posets, we generalize a bottleneck version of Dilworth's theorem, again weighted in a distributive lattice. These results are applicable to a wide array of non-numerical network flow problems, as shown. All results, proofs, and applications were created in collaboration with AI language models. An appendix documents their role and impact.</description>

      <title>Coloring Trivalent Graphs: A Defect TFT Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the combinatorial matter of graph coloring is, in fact, quantum in the sense of satisfying the sum over all the possible intermediate state properties of a path integral. In our case, the topological field theory (TFT) with defects gives meaning to it. This TFT has the property that when evaluated on a planar trivalent graph, it provides the number of Tait-Coloring of it. Defects can be considered as a generalization of groups. With the Klein-four group as a 1-defect condition, we reinterpret graph coloring as sections of a certain bundle, distinguishing a coloring (global-sections) from a coloring process (local-sections.) These constructions also lead to an interpretation of the word problem, for a finitely presented group, as a cobordism problem and a generalization of (trivial) bundles at the level of higher categories.</description>

      <title>Pointwise order of generalized Hofstadter functions $G, H$ and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We establish here that this family is ordered pointwise: for all $k$ and $n$, $F_k(n) \le F_{k+1}(n)$. For achieving this, a detour is made via infinite morphic words generalizing the Fibonacci word. Various properties of these words are proved, concerning the lengths of substituted prefixes of these words and the counts of some specific letters in these prefixes. We also relate the limits of $\frac{1}{n}F_k(n)$ to the frequencies of letters in the considered words.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a circuit walk from a given feasible point of a given linear program to an optimal point can be computed in polynomial time using only linear algebra operations and the solution of the single given linear program.
  We also show that a Graver walk from a given feasible point of a given integer program to an optimal point is polynomial time computable using an integer programming oracle, but without such an oracle, it is hard to compute such a walk even if an optimal solution to the given program is given as well.
  Combining our oracle algorithm with recent results on sparse integer programming, we also show that Graver walks from any point are polynomial time computable over matrices of bounded tree-depth and subdeterminants.</description>

      <title>Simulating Simple Random Walks With a Deck of Cards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00831v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When we want to simulate the realization of a symmetric simple random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, we use $(2d)$-side fair dice to decide to which neighbor it jumps at each step if $d\geq 2$ or we simply use a fair coin when $d=1$. Assume that instead of using a dice or a coin we want to do a simulation using a well shuffled deck with $K$ cards of each of the $2d$ suits. In the first step the probability of jumping to each neighbor is $(2d)^{-1}$, but from the second step it becomes biased. Of course if we continue performing this simulation, the total variation distance between its law and the law of the random walk will increase until all cards are used. In this paper we investigate the minimum number of cards $N=2d K$ that a deck must contain so that the total variation distance between the law of a $n$-step simulation and the law of a $n$-step realization of the random walk is smaller than a chosen threshold $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. More generally, we prove that when $N=cn$ this distance converges, as $n \to \infty$, to a Gaussian profile which depends on $c\geq 2d$. Furthermore, our analysis shows that this Gaussian profile vanishes as $c \to \infty$, proving the convergence of a multivariate hypergeometric distribution to a multinomial distribution in total variation.</description>

      <title>Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of (independent) unitary matrices. We consider both the case of an invariant random tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, called mixed, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, and which includes the random tensor models that have been extensively studied in the physics literature (we provide a short review of these results).
  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined in terms of the correlations of certain invariant polynomials called trace-invariants, encoded by $D$-uplets of permutations, up to relabelling equivalence. Using the unitary invariance, we define a notion of finite free cumulants associated to the expectations of these trace-invariants, through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.
  In order to characterize the asymptotic distributions at first order, two important classes of random tensors are considered: pure random tensors that scale like a pure complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of free cumulants associated to the first order trace-invariants, through closed moment-cumulant formulas, which involve $D$ independent summations over non-crossing permutations. While the formulas involve the same combinatorics, the asymptotic distributions differ by the class of invariants that define the distribution at first order. Both in the pure and in the mixed case, the first order free-cumulants of a sum of two independent random tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of the higher orders is provided. Finally, tensor freeness is then defined (at first order) as the vanishing of mixed free cumulants associated to first order trace-invariants.</description>

      <title>Comparing list-color functions of uniform hypergraphs with their chromatic polynomials (III)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02045v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hypergraph ${\cal H}$, let $P({\cal H},k)$ and $P_l({\cal H},k)$ be its chromatic polynomial and list-color function respectively, and let $\tau'({\cal H})$ be the least non-negative integer $q$ such that $P({\cal H},k)=P_l({\cal H},k)$ holds for all integers $k\ge q$. In this article, we show that for any $r$-uniform hypergraph ${\cal H}$ of order $n$ and size $m$ and any $k$-assignment $L$ of ${\cal H}$, where $r\ge 3$, $P({\cal H},L)-P({\cal H},k)\ge \min \{0.02k, k-(m-1)\} k^{n-r-1}\sum_{e\in E({\cal H})} \left ( k-\left |\bigcap_{v\in e}L(v)\right | \right )$ holds for $k\ge m-1\ge 4$. It follows that $\tau'({\cal H})\le m-1$, improving the current best result on $\tau'({\cal H})$.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a new presentation for Specht modules whose conjugate shapes have strictly decreasing parts by introducing a linear operator on the space generated by column tabloids. The generators of the presentation are column tabloids and the relations form a proper subset of the Garnir relations of Fulton. The results in this paper extend earlier results of the authors and Stanley on Specht modules of staircase shape.</description>

      <title>Note on Min-k-Planar Drawings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11610v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The k-planar graphs, which are (usually with small values of k such as 1, 2, 3) subject to recent intense research, admit a drawing in which edges are allowed to cross, but each one edge is allowed to carry at most k crossings. In recently introduced [Binucci et al., GD 2023] min-k-planar drawings of graphs, edges may possibly carry more than k crossings, but in any two crossing edges, at least one of the two must have at most k crossings. In both concepts, one may consider general drawings or a popular restricted concept of drawings called simple. In a simple drawing, every two edges are allowed to cross at most once, and any two edges which share a vertex are forbidden to cross. While, regarding the former concept, it is for k&lt;=3 known (but perhaps not widely known) that every general k-planar graph admits a simple k-planar drawing and this ceases to be true for any k&gt;=4, the difference between general and simple drawings in the latter concept is more striking. We prove that there exist graphs with a min-2-planar drawing, or with a min-3-planar drawing avoiding crossings of adjacent edges, which have no simple min-k-planar drawings for arbitrarily large fixed k.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we relate a well-known in symplectic geometry compactification of the space of symmetric bilinear forms considered as a chart of the Lagrangian Grassmannian to the specific compactifications of the space of electrical networks in the disc obtained in \cite{L}, \cite{CGS} and \cite{BGKT}. In particular, we state an explicit connection between these works and describe some of the combinatorics developed there in the language of symplectic geometry. We also show that the combinatorics of the concordance vectors forces the uniqueness of the symplectic form, such that corresponding points of the Grassmannian are isotropic. We define a notion of Lagrangian concordance which provides a construction of the compactification of the space of electrical networks in the positive part of the Lagrangian Grassmannian bypassing the construction from \cite{L}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order $n$ and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree $k\,(\geq 3)$, even girth $g\,(\geq 4)$, and number of $g$-cycles traversing a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of some Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding slightly tighter lower bounds of the diameters than those for random $k$-regular graphs proposed by Bollob\'{a}s and de la Vega. They range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are mainly interested in using the $q$-exponential operator of Chen [8] in proving identities involving the generalized Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials r$_{n}(x,b;q)$ of Saad [11], the $(s,t)$-derivatives of Partial Theta function $\Theta_{0}(x,q)$ of Ramanujan, the generalized simplicial $d$-polytopic numbers $\fibonomial{n+d}{d}_{s,t}$, and the deformed $(s,t)$-trinomial series, both introduced in this paper. In particular, we will give the deformed and non-deformed ordinary generating functions of the sequences $\rr_{n}(x,b;q)$, $\fibonomial{n+d}{d}_{s,t}$, $\qbinom{n+d}{d}_{q}^2$, and $\qbinom{n+d}{d}_{q}\rr_{n}(x,b;q)$. We also derive $(s,t)$-analogues of the alternating sums of squares and sums of cubes.</description>

Miezaki et al. generalised the chromatic symmetric function and defined the Kneser chromatic functions denoted by $\{X_{K_{\mathbb{N},k}}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$, and rephrase Stanley's conjecture that $X_{K_{\mathbb{N},1}}$ is a complete invariant for trees. This paper shows $X_{K_{\mathbb{N},2}}$ is a complete invariant for trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the notion of a transitive subgroup of a permutation group $P$ extends naturally to the subsets of $P$. We study transitive subsets of the wreath product $G \wr S_n$, where $G$ is a finite abelian group. This includes the hyperoctahedral group for $G=C_2$. We give structural characterisations of transitive subsets using the character theory of $G \wr S_n$ and interpret such subsets as designs in the conjugacy class association scheme of $G \wr S_n$. In particular, we prove a generalisation of the Livingstone-Wagner theorem and give explicit constructions of transitive sets. Moreover, we establish connections to orthogonal polynomials, namely the Charlier polynomials, and use them to study codes and designs in $C_r \wr S_n$. Many of our results extend results about the symmetric group $S_n$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a sequence of lattices $\{L_{n_i}\subset \mathbb R^{n_i}\}$ for $n_i\longrightarrow\infty$, with exponentially large kissing numbers, namely, $\log_2\tau(L_{n_i})&gt; 0.0338\cdot n_i -o(n_i)$. We also show that the maximum lattice kissing number $ \tau^l_{n}$ in $n$ dimensions verifies $\log_2\tau^l_{n}&gt; 0.0219\cdot n -o(n)$.</description>

      <title>New bounds in the discrete analogue of Minkowski's second theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt an argument of Tao and Vu to show that if $\lambda_1\le\cdots\le\lambda_d$ are the successive minima of an origin-symmetric convex body $K$ with respect to some lattice $\Lambda&lt;\mathbb{R}^d$, and if we set $k=\max\{j:\lambda_j\le1\}$, then $K$ contains at most $2^k(1+\frac{\lambda_k}2)^k/\lambda_1\cdots\lambda_k$ lattice points. This provides improved bounds in a conjecture of Betke, Henk and Wills (1993), and verifies that conjecture asymptotically as $\lambda_k\to0$. We also obtain a similar result without the symmetry assumption.</description>

      <title>Restricted sumsets in multiplicative subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the restricted sumset analogue of the celebrated conjecture of S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy on additive decompositions of the set of nonzero squares over a finite field. More precisely, we show that if $q&gt;13$ is an odd prime power, then the set of nonzero squares in $\mathbb{F}_q$ cannot be written as a restricted sumset $A \hat{+} A$, extending a result of Shkredov. More generally, we study restricted sumsets in multiplicative subgroups over finite fields as well as restricted sumsets in perfect powers (over integers) motivated by a question of Erd\H{o}s and Moser. We also prove an analogue of van Lint-MacWilliams' conjecture for restricted sumsets, which appears to be the first analogue of Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem in a family of Cayley sum graphs.</description>

      <title>O(1) Insertion for Random Walk d-ary Cuckoo Hashing up to the Load Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing algorithm was defined by Fotakis, Pagh, Sanders, and Spirakis to generalize and improve upon the standard cuckoo hashing algorithm of Pagh and Rodler. Random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing has low space overhead, guaranteed fast access, and fast in practice insertion time. In this paper, we give a theoretical insertion time bound for this algorithm. More precisely, for every $d\ge 3$ hashes, let $c_d^*$ be the sharp threshold for the load factor at which a valid assignment of $cm$ objects to a hash table of size $m$ likely exists. We show that for any $d\ge 4$ hashes and load factor $c&lt;c_d^*$, the expectation of the random walk insertion time is $O(1)$, that is, a constant depending only on $d$ and $c$ but not $m$.</description>

      <title>On the correctness of Maximum Parsimony for data with few substitutions in the NNI neighborhood of phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01282v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating phylogenetic trees, which depict the relationships between different species, from aligned sequence data (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) is one of the main aims of evolutionary biology. However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated). On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those binary characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree.
  It is the aim of the present paper to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree $T$ with $n$ leaves, as long as $k&lt;\frac{n}{8}+\frac{11}{9}-\frac{1}{18}\sqrt{9\cdot \left(\frac{n}{4}\right)^2+16}$ (or, equivalently, $n&gt;9 k-11+\sqrt{9k^2-22 k+17} $, which in particular holds for all $n\geq 12k$), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all binary characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for the said alignment. This partially answers a recently published conjecture affirmatively. Additionally, we show that for $n\geq 8$ and for $k$ being in the order of $\frac{n}{2}$, there is always a pair of phylogenetic trees $T$ and $T'$ which are NNI neighbors, but for which the alignment of characters requiring precisely $k$ substitutions each on $T$ in total requires fewer substitutions on $T'$.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for complementary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the n-th positive square number is easy, as it is simply $n^2$. But how do we find the complementary sequence, i.e. the n-th positive nonsquare number? For this case there is an explicit formula. However, for general constraints on a number, this is harder to find. In this paper, we study how to compute the n-th integer that does (or does not) satisfy a certain condition. In particular, we consider it as a fixed point problem, relate it to the iterative method of Lambek and Moser, study a bisection approach to this problem and provide formulas for various complementary sequences such as the non-k-gonal numbers, non-k-gonal pyramidal numbers, non-k-simplex numbers, non-sum-of-k-th powers and non-k-th powers.</description>

      <title>Canonical labelling of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $p=O(1/n)$, then the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p)$ with high probability admits a canonical labeling computable in time $O(n\log n)$. Combined with the previous results on the canonization of random graphs, this implies that $G(n,p)$ with high probability admits a polynomial-time canonical labeling whatever the edge probability function $p$. Our algorithm combines the standard color refinement routine with simple post-processing based on the classical linear-time tree canonization. Noteworthy, our analysis of how well color refinement performs in this setting allows us to complete the description of the automorphism group of the 2-core of $G(n,p)$.</description>
