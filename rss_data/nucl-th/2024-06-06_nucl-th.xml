      <title>Effects of pairing strength on the nuclear structure and double-$\beta$ decay predictions within the mapped interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy nuclear structure and two-neutrino double-$\beta$ ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decay are studied within the interacting boson model (IBM) that is based on the nuclear energy density functional (EDF). The IBM Hamiltonian describing the initial and final even-even nuclei, and the interacting boson fermion-fermion Hamiltonian producing the intermediate states of the neighboring odd-odd nuclei, are determined by the microscopic inputs provided by the self-consistent mean-field (SCMF) calculations employing a relativistic EDF and a separable pairing force. Sensitivities of the low-lying structure and $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay properties to the pairing strength are specifically analyzed. It is shown that the SCMF calculations with the decreased and increased pairing strengths lead to the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strengths in the IBM that are, respectively, significantly enhanced and reduced in magnitude. When the increased pairing is adopted, in particular, the energy levels of the excited $0^+$ states are lowered, and the predicted $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) increase in magnitude systematically. The mapped IBM employing the increased pairing force generates effective NMEs and half-lives that are overall in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Study of hybrid stars with nonstrange quark matter cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use a modified 2-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to study hybrid stars with a hypothesis that the quark matter may not be strange [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 222001 (2018)]. To obtain hybrid equation of states, the Maxwell construction is used to describe the first-order confinement-deconfinement phase transition in hybrid stars. With recent measurements on neutron star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, the hybrid equation of states are constrained. The result suggests that pure nonstrange quark matter cores can exist in hybrid stars, possessing 0.014-0.026 solar mass, and the binary neutron stars in GW170817 may be hadron stars.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous SU(2) gluon matter under rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a rotating SU(2) gluon system have been studied with the dyon ensemble in dilute limit. By solving the rotation-modified Yang-Mills equation we have obtained rotational corrections to the so-called dyon solutions with arbitrary centers to $\mathcal{O}(\omega^2)$ order and the corresponding semi-classical potential. The radial position dependent deconfinement temperature have been obtained by minimizing the semi-classical potential in both real and imaginary angular velocity cases. Although without the $\omega$-dependent coupling constant the critical temperature behaves different from the lattice simulation at each radial position as the rotation goes faster, its radial dependence is qualitatively the same as the lattice. That is in the real velocity case the outer layer will deconfine more difficult while the reverse is true in the imaginary velocity case.</description>

      <title>On the use of quantality in nuclei and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of quantality is discussed in the case of nuclei and other many-body systems such as atomic electrons. This dimensionless quantity is known to indicate when a many-body system behaves like a crystal or a quantum liquid. Its role is further analyzed, showing the emergence of a fundamental lengthscale, the limit radius, which corresponds to the hard-core of the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the case of nucleons, and to a value close to the Bohr radius in the case of atomic electrons. The occurrence of a cluster phase in nuclei is analyzed using the quantality through its relation to the localization parameter, allowing for the identification of both the number of nucleons and the density as control parameters for the occurrence of this phase. The relation of the quantality to the magnitude of the interaction also exhibits a third dimensionless parameter, monitoring the magnitude of the spin-orbit effect in finite systems, through the realization of the pseudo-spin symmetry. The impact of quantality on the spin-orbit effect is compared in various many-body systems. The role of quantality in the relative effect of the binding energy and the shell one is also analyzed in nuclei. Finally, additional dimensionless quantities are proposed from the generalization of the quantality. Nuclei are found to be exceptional systems because all their dimensionless quantities are close to the order of unity, at variance with other many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Strange Dwarfs: a review on the (in)stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs are the remnants of stars not massive enough to become supernovae. This review explores the concept of strange dwarfs, a unique class of white dwarfs which contain cores of strange quark matter. Strange dwarfs have different sizes, masses, and evolutionary paths with respect to white dwarfs. They might form through the accumulation of normal matter on strange quark stars or by capture of strangelets. The stability of strange dwarfs has been debated, with initial studies suggesting stability, while later analyses indicated potential instability. This review revisits these discussions, focusing on the critical role of boundary conditions between nuclear and quark matter in determining stability. It also offers insights into their formation, structure, and possible detection in the universe.</description>

      <title>A dynamical implementation of canonical second quantization on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop theoretical methods for the implementation of creation and destruction operators in separate registers of a quantum computer, allowing for a transparent and dynamical creation and destruction of particle modes in second quantization in problems with variable particle number. We establish theorems for the commutation (anticommutation) relations on a finite memory bank and provide the needed symmetrizing and antisymmetrizing operators. Finally, we provide formulae in terms of these operators for unitary evolution under conventional two- and four-body Hamiltonian terms, as well as terms varying the particle number. In this formalism, the number of qubits needed to codify $n$ particles with $N_p$ modes each is of order $n\log_2 N_p$. Such scaling is more efficient than the Jordan-Wigner transformation which requires $O(N_p)$ qubits, whenever there are a modest number of particles with a large number of states available to each (and less advantageous for a large number of particles with few states available to each). And although less efficient, it is also less cumbersome than compact encoding.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal chiral contributions to generalized parton distributions of the proton at nonzero skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop contributions to spin-averaged generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in the proton from pseudoscalar mesons with intermediate octet and decuplet baryon states at nonzero skewness. Our framework is based on nonlocal covariant chiral effective theory, with ultraviolet divergences regularized by introducing a relativistic regulator derived consistently from the nonlocal Lagrangian. Using the splitting functions calculated from the nonlocal Lagrangian, we find the nonzero skewness GPDs from meson loops by convoluting with the phenomenological pion GPD and the generalized distribution amplitude, and verify that these satisfy the correct polynomiality properties. We also compute the lowest two moments of GPDs to quantify the meson loop effects on the Dirac, Pauli and gravitational form factors of the proton.</description>

      <title>Probing hadron-quark phase transition in twin stars using $f$-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is conjectured that a phase transition from hadronic to deconfined quark matter in the ultrahigh-density environment of Neutron Stars (NS), the nature of phase transition remains an unresolved mystery. Furthermore, recent efforts reveal that the finite surface tension effects can lead to a mixed phase with different geometric shapes (so-called "pasta" phases), leading to a smooth phase transition from hadronic to quark matter in the NS interior. Depending on whether there is a strong or a pasta-induced smooth first-order phase transition, one may expect a third family of stable, compact stars or "twin stars" to appear, with the same mass but different radii compared to NSs. The possibility of identifying twin stars using astrophysical observations has been a subject of interest. This study investigates the potential of probing the nature of the hadron-quark phase transition through future gravitational wave (GW) detections from fundamental ($f$-) mode oscillations in Neutron Stars. Using a newly developed model that parametrizes the hadron-quark phase transition with ``pasta phases," we calculate $f$-mode characteristics within a full general relativistic framework. We then use Universal Relations in GW asteroseismology to derive stellar properties from the detected mode parameters. Our findings suggest that detecting GWs from $f$-modes with third-generation GW detectors offers a promising scenario for the existence of twin stars. However, we also estimate various uncertainties in determining the mode parameters and conclude that these uncertainties make it more challenging to identify the nature of the hadron-quark phase transition.</description>

      <title>Abnormal Bifurcation of the Double Binding Energy Differences and Proton-Neutron Pairing: Nuclei Close to $N=Z$ Line from Ni to Rb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11426v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently observed abnormal bifurcation of the double binding energy differences $\delta V_{pn}$ between the odd-odd and even-even nuclei along the $N=Z$ line from Ni to Rb has challenged the nuclear theories. To solve this problem, a shell-model-like approach based on the relativistic density functional theory is established, by treating simultaneously the neutron-neutron, proton-neutron, and proton-proton pairing correlations both microscopically and self-consistently. Without any \textit{ad hoc} parameters, the calculated results well reproduce the observations, and the mechanism for this abnormal bifurcation is found to be due to the enhanced proton-neutron pairing correlations in the odd-odd $N=Z$ nuclei, compared with the even-even ones. The present results provide an excellent interpretation for the abnormal $\delta V_{pn}$ bifurcation, and provide a clear signal for the existence of the proton-neutron pairing correlations for nuclei close to the $N=Z$ line.</description>

      <title>Modern nuclear and astrophysical constraints of dense matter in a renormalized chiral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram's complexities, including quark deconfinement transitions, liquid-gas phase changes, and critical points, using the chiral mean-field (CMF) model that is able to capture all these features. We introduce a vector meson renormalization within the CMF framework, enabling precise adjustments of meson masses and coupling strengths related to vector meson interactions. Performing a new fit to the deconfinement potential, we are able to replicate recent lattice QCD results, low energy nuclear physics properties, neutron star observational data, and key phase diagram features as per modern constraints. This approach enhances our understanding of vector mesons' roles in mediating nuclear interactions and their impact on the equation of state, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the QCD phase diagram and its implications for nuclear and astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12494v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A discrete formulation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a functional of paths with respect to a complex probability on a sample space of discrete valued paths is explored. The formulation in terms of complex probabilities is motivated by a recent reinterpretation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a potential functional with respect to a complex probability distribution on cylinder sets of paths. The discrete formulation in this work is based on a discrete version of Weyl algebra that can be applied to any observable with a finite number of outcomes. The origin of the complex probability in this work is the completeness relation. In the discrete formulation the complex probability exactly factors into products of conditional probabilities and exact unitarity is maintained at each level of approximation. The approximation of infinite dimensional quantum systems by discrete systems is discussed. Applications to scattering theory and quantum field theory are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Path-integral approaches to strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core of this thesis is the path-integral formulation of quantum field theory and its ability to describe strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems of finite size. Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with various resummation methods (Pad\'e-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...), functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail.</description>

      <title>Deep Exclusive Meson Production as a probe to the puzzle of $\Lambda$ hyperon polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, an unexpected transverse $\Lambda$ polarization in unpolarized proton-Beryllium collisions was discovered, which initiated extensive studies on spin phenomena in high-energy physics. Over the past five decades, similar transverse $\Lambda$ polarization has been observed across various collision systems, including lepton-hadron deep inelastic scattering, hadron-hadron collisions, and electron-positron collisions. Despite numerous promising theoretical models, the fundamental mechanism underlying this polarization phenomenon remains inconclusive to this day. However, in both longitudinally and transversely polarized lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions, it is found that the $\Lambda$ hyperon is not polarized with respect to the initial parton spin direction. How the $\Lambda$ hyperon acquires its spin has become one of the most crucial questions to address in order to resolve this puzzle. In this paper, I propose to use an exclusive process that can be measured at the Electron-Ion Collider, the Deep Exclusive Meson Production, to explicitly test the mechanism of $\Lambda$ polarization. The outcomes of this experimental measurement are anticipated to unveil the dominant mechanism by which $\Lambda$ obtains its spin, eliminating many of the ambiguities that have been encountered in previous studies. Finally, experimental challenges and requirements will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Novel Cross Section Ratios as Possible Signals of Saturation in UPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new cross section ratios in ultra-peripheral A$+$A and $p+$A collisions (UPCs) as a potential experimental signal of saturation physics. We consider the ratio $R_1$ of elastic vector meson photoproduction cross section to the inclusive hadron or jet photoproduction cross section. The ratio can be measured in the $\gamma +$A and $\gamma + p$ collisions taking place in the UPCs. We label the ratios $R_1 ({\rm A})$ and $R_1 (p)$, respectively. Constructing the double ratio $R_{\rm{UPC}} ({\rm A}) = R_1 ({\rm A})/R_1 (p)$, and performing a small-$x$ calculation both in the quasi-classical approximation and by including small-$x$ evolution, we observe that $R_{\rm{UPC}} ({\rm A})$ exhibits a markedly different dependence on the nuclear atomic number inside and outside the saturation region. This result indicates that $R_{\rm{UPC}} ({\rm A})$ and $R_1 ({\rm A})$ measurements in UPCs may help in the experimental searches for the evidence of saturation physics.</description>

      <title>Understanding the nature of the $\Delta(1600)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a coupled-channel analysis of the $ J^P = 3/2^+ \Delta $-baryon spectrum, based in the framework of Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory (HEFT). We construct a Hamiltonian which mixes quark model-like single-particle states and two-particle meson-baryon channels, and constrain this via experimentally measured $ \pi N \to \pi N $ scattering observables. In the same vein as L\"{u}scher's approach, we then connect this infinite-volume inspired Hamiltonian with finite-volume lattice QCD results. Drawing on lattice correlation-matrix eigenvectors identifying the $ 1s $ and $ 2s $ states in the finite-volume $ \Delta(3/2^+) $ spectrum, and utilising the HEFT eigenvectors describing the composition of the energy eigenstates, we resolve the structure of these states and their relation to the $ \Delta(1600) $ resonance. We find the dominant contributions to this resonance come from strong rescattering in the $ \pi N $ and $ \pi \Delta $ channels. This contrasts the long-held view of a dominant quark model-like core for the $ \Delta(1600) $.

Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity can be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>
