      <title>Optimal Stopping for the Uniform Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many discrete-time optimal stopping problems are known to have more tractable limit forms based on a planar Poisson process. Using this tool we find a solution to the optimal stopping problem for i.i.d. sequence of $n$ discrete uniform random variables, in the asymptotic regime where $n$ and the range of distribution are of the same order. The optimal stopping rule in the Poisson problem is identified, by means of a time change, with known asymptotic solution to Lindley's problem of minimising the expected rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical anti-concentration results focus on the random sum $S := \sum _{i=1}^n \xi_i v_i$, where $\xi_i$ are independent random variables and $v_i$ are real numbers. In this paper, we prove new concentration results concerning the random sum $S := \sum_{i=1}^n w_{\pi _i } v_i $, where $w_i , v_i$ are real numbers and $\pi$ is a random permutation.</description>

      <title>Restoring Convergence in Heavy-Tailed Risk Models: A Weighted Kolmogorov Approach for Robust Backtesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard risk metrics used in model validation, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, fail to converge at practical rates when applied to high-frequency financial data characterized by heavy tails (infinite skewness). This creates a "noise barrier" where valid risk models are rejected due to tail events irrelevant to central tendency accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a Weighted Kolmogorov Metric tailored for financial time series with sub-cubic moments ($\mathbb{E}|X|^{2+\delta}&lt;\infty$). By incorporating an exhaustion function $h(x)$ that mechanically downweights extreme tail noise, we prove that we can restore the optimal Gaussian convergence rate of $O(n^{-1/2})$ even for Pareto and Student-t distributions common in Crypto and FX markets. We provide a complete proof using a core/tail truncation scheme and establish the optimal tuning of the weight parameter $q$.</description>

      <title>The pinned half-space Airy line ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-space models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class exhibit rich boundary phenomena that alter the asymptotic behavior familiar from their full-space counterparts. A distinguishing feature of these systems is the presence of a boundary parameter that governs a transition between subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes, characterized by different scaling exponents and fluctuation statistics.
  In this paper we construct the pinned half-space Airy line ensemble $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \infty}$ on $[0,\infty)$ -- a natural half-space analogue of the Airy line ensemble -- expected to arise as the universal scaling limit of supercritical half-space KPZ models. The ensemble $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \infty}$ is obtained as the weak limit of the critical half-space Airy line ensembles $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \varpi}$ introduced in arXiv:2505.01798 as the boundary parameter $\varpi$ tends to infinity.
  We show that $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \infty}$ has a Pfaffian point process structure with an explicit correlation kernel and that, after a parabolic shift, it satisfies a one-sided Brownian Gibbs property described by pairwise pinned Brownian motions. Far from the origin, $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{hs}; \infty}$ converges to the standard Airy line ensemble, while at the origin its distribution coincides with that of the ordered eigenvalues (with doubled multiplicity) of the stochastic Airy operator with $\beta = 4$.</description>

      <title>Distributional Limits for Eigenvalues of Graphon Kernel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fluctuations of individual eigenvalues of kernel matrices arising from dense graphon-based random graphs. Under minimal integrability and boundedness assumptions on the graphon, we establish distributional limits for simple, well-separated eigenvalues of the associated integral operator. We show that a sharp dichotomy governs the asymptotic behavior. In the non-degenerate regime, the properly normalized empirical eigenvalue satisfies a central limit theorem with an explicit variance, whereas in the degenerate regime, the leading fluctuations vanish and the centered eigenvalue converges to an explicit weighted chi-square limit determined by the operator spectrum. Our analysis requires no smoothness or Lipschitz-type assumptions on the graphon. While earlier work under comparable integrability conditions established operator convergence and eigenspace consistency, the present results characterize the full fluctuation behavior of individual eigenvalues, thereby extending eigenvalue fluctuation theory beyond regimes accessible through operator convergence alone.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles and functional limit theorems in the deep limit of wide random neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies large deviation principles and weak convergence,
  both at the level of finite-dimensional distributions and in functional form,
  for a class of continuous, isotropic, centered Gaussian random
  fields defined on the unit sphere. The covariance functions of these
  fields evolve recursively through a nonlinear map induced by an
  activation function, reflecting the statistical dynamics of infinitely
  wide random neural networks as depth increases.
  We consider two types of centered fields, obtained by subtracting either the value at the
  North Pole or the spherical average. According to the behavior of the derivative at $t=1$ of the associated covariance function, we identify three regimes: low disorder, sparse, and high disorder.
  In the low-disorder regime, we establish functional large deviation principles and weak
  convergence results. In the sparse regime, we obtain large deviation
  principles and weak convergence for finite-dimensional distributions,
  while both properties fail at the functional level sense due to the emergence of discontinuities
  in the covariance recursion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the strong rate of convergence for the Euler--Maruyama scheme for multi-dimensional stochastic differential equations with uniformly locally (unbounded) H\"older continuous drift and multiplicative noise. Our technique is based on It\^o--Tanaka trick (Zvonkin transformation) for unbounded drift. Moreover, in order to apply the stochastic sewing lemma, we use the heat kernel estimate for the density function of the Euler--Maruyama scheme.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Brownian loop soup clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Brownian loop soup clusters in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for an arbitrary intensity $\alpha&gt;0$. We show the existence of a phase transition for the presence of unbounded clusters and study its basic properties. In particular, we show that, when $\alpha$ is sufficiently large, almost surely all the loops are connected into a single cluster. Such a phenomenon is not observed in discrete percolation-type models. In addition, we prove the existence of a one-arm exponent and compare the clusters with the finite-range system obtained by imposing lower and upper bounds on the diameter of the loops.
  Finally, we provide a toolbox concerning the Brownian loop measure in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 3$. In particular, we derive decomposition formulas by rerooting the loops in specific ways and show that the loop measure is conformally invariant, generalising results of [Lup18] in dimension 1 and [LW04] in dimension 2.</description>

      <title>Several expressions of the net single premiums under the constant force of mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present several formulas that make it easier to compute the net single premiums when the mortality force over the fractional ages is assumed to be constant (C). More precisely, we compute the moments of the random variables $\nu^{T_x}$, $T_x$, $T_x\nu^{T_x}$, etc., where $T_x$ denotes the future lifetime of a person who is $x\in\{0,\,1,\,\ldots\}$ years old, and $\nu$ is the annual discount multiplier. We verify the obtained formulas on the real data from the human mortality table and the Gompertz survival law. The obtained numbers are compared with the corresponding ones when the survival function over fractional ages is interpolated using the uniform distribution of deaths (UDD) and Balducci's (B) assumptions. We also formulate and prove the statement on the comparison of the moments of the mentioned random variables under assumptions (C), (UDD), and (B).</description>

      <title>Convergence to Stable Laws for Products of Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under reasonable algebraic assumptions and under an infinite second order moment assumption, we show that the logarithm of the norm (log-norm) of a product of random i.i.d. matrices with entries in $\mathbb{R}$ or in any other local field satisfies a generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT) in the sense of Paul L\'evi.
  The proof is based on a weak law of large number for the difference $\Delta_n$ between the log-norm of the product of the first $n$ matrices and the sum of their log-norms. This weak law of large numbers morally says that $\Delta_n$ behaves like a sum of i.i.d. random variables that have a finite moment of order $2q$ as long as the log-norm of each matrices has a finite moment of order $q$ for a given $q &gt; 0$.
  This gain of moment is the central result of the present paper and is based on the construction of pivotal times. Moreover, these results admit a nice higher rank extension when one looks at the full Cartan projection instead of the log-norm.</description>

      <title>Forming invariant stochastic differential systems with a given first integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a method for forming invariant stochastic differential systems, namely dynamic systems with trajectories belonging to a given smooth manifold. The It\^o or Stratonovich stochastic differential equations with the Wiener component describe dynamic systems, and the manifold is implicitly defined by a differentiable function. A convenient implementation of the algorithm for forming invariant stochastic differential systems within symbolic computation environments characterizes the proposed method. It is based on determining a basis associated with a tangent hyperplane to the manifold. The article discusses the problem of basis degeneration and examines variants that allow for the simple construction of a basis that does not degenerate. Examples of invariant stochastic differential systems are given, and numerical simulations are performed for them.</description>

Abstract: We observe that the distribution of the eigenvalues of an $N$-by-$N$ GUE random matrix is log-concave on $\mathbb{R}^N$, and that the same is true for the law of a single gap between two consecutive eigenvalues. We use this observation to prove several concentration bounds for the semicircle-renormalised eigengaps, improving on bounds recently obtained in [Tao (2024).

      <title>Ergodicity and asymptotic limits for Langevin interacting systems with singular forces and multiplicative noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study systems of $N$ interacting particles described by the classical and relativistic Langevin dynamics with singular forces and multiplicative noises. For the classical model, we prove the ergodicity, obtaining an exponential rate of convergence to the invariant Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, and the small-mass limit, recovering the $N$-particle interacting overdamped Langevin dynamics. For the relativistic model, we establish the ergodicity, obtaining an algebraic mixing rate of any order to the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution, and the Newtonian limit (that is when the speed of light tends to infinity), approximating a system of underdamped Langevin dynamics. The proofs rely on the construction of Lyapunov functions that account for irregular potentials and multiplicative noises.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium stationary fluctuations of a symmetric zero-range process on the discrete interval $\{1, \ldots, N-1\}$ coupled to reservoirs at sites $1$ and $N-1$, which inject and remove particles at rates proportional to $N^{-\theta}$ for any value of $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$. We prove that, if the jump rate is bounded and under diffusive scaling, the fluctuations converge to the solution of a generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation with characteristic operators that depend on the stationary density profile. The limiting equation is supplemented with boundary conditions of Dirichlet, Robin, or Neumann type, depending on the strength of the reservoirs. We also introduce two notions of solutions to the corresponding martingale problems, which differ according to the choice of test functions.</description>

      <title>The Minary Primitive of Computational Autopoiesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Minary, a computational framework designed as a candidate for the first formally provable autopoietic primitive. Minary represents interacting probabilistic events as multi-dimensional vectors and combines them via linear superposition rather than multiplicative scalar operations, thereby preserving uncertainty and enabling constructive and destructive interference in the range $[-1,1]$. A fixed set of ``perspectives'' evaluates ``semantic dimensions'' according to hidden competencies, and their interactions drive two discrete-time stochastic processes. We model this system as an iterated random affine map and use the theory of iterated random functions to prove that it converges in distribution to a unique stationary law; we moreover obtain an explicit closed form for the limiting expectation in terms of row, column, and global averages of the competency matrix. We then derive exact formulas for the mean and variance of the normalized consensus conditioned on the activation of a given semantic dimension, revealing how consensus depends on competency structure rather than raw input signals. Finally, we argue that Minary is organizationally closed yet operationally open in the sense of Maturana and Varela, and we discuss implications for building self-maintaining, distributed, and parallelizable computational systems that house a uniquely subjective notion of identity.</description>

      <title>The Strong Law of Large Numbers for random semigroups with unbounded generators on uniformly smooth Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random linear unbounded operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{X})$ on a Banach space $\mathcal{X}$. For example, such random operators may be random quantum channels. The Law of Large Numbers is known when $\mathcal{X}$ is a Hilbert space, in the form of the usual Law of Large Numbers for random operators, and in some other particular cases. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables, there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_i t/n}$. We obtain the Strong Law of Large Numbers in Strong Operator Topology for random semigroups of unbounded linear operators on a uniformly smooth Banach space.</description>

Abstract: We consider Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators with general degenerate coefficients. We prove semiclassical hypocoercivity estimates for a large class of such operators. Then, we manage to prove Eyring-Kramers formulas for the bottom of the spectrum of some particular degenerate operators in the semiclassical regime, and quantify the spectral gap separating these eigenvalues from the rest of the spectrum. The main ingredient is the construction of sharp Gaussian quasimodes through an adaptation of the WKB method.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Maximum Likelihood Classification Before and After Applying Weierstrass Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to use Maximum Likelihood (ML) Classification on multispectral data by means of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Maximum Likelihood is a supervised classification algorithm which is based on the Classical Bayes theorem. It makes use of a discriminant function to assign pixel to the class with the highest likelihood. Class means vector and covariance matrix are the key inputs to the function and can be estimated from training pixels of a particular class. As Maximum Likelihood need some assumptions before it has to be applied on the data. In this paper we will compare the results of Maximum Likelihood Classification (ML) before apply the Weierstrass Transform and apply Weierstrass Transform and will see the difference between the accuracy on training pixels of high resolution Quickbird satellite image. Principle Component analysis (PCA) is also used for dimension reduction and also used to check the variation in bands. The results shows that the separation between mean of the classes in the decision space is to be the main factor that leads to the high classification accuracy of Maximum Likelihood (ML) after using Weierstrass Transform than without using it.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of invariant measures as a structural property of markov kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify indecomposability as a key measure-theoretic underlying uniqueness of invariant probability measures for discrete-time Markov kernels on general state spaces. The argument relies on the mutual singularity of distinct invariant ergodic measures and on the observation that uniqueness follows whenever all invariant probability measures are forced to charge a common reference measure.
  Once existence of invariant probability measures is known, indecomposability alone is sufficient to rule out multiplicity. On standard Borel spaces, this viewpoint is consistent with the classical theory: irreducibility appears as a convenient sufficient condition ensuring indecomposability, rather than as a structural requirement for uniqueness.
  The resulting proofs are purely measure-theoretic and do not rely on recurrence, regeneration, return-time estimates, or regularity assumptions on the transition kernel.</description>

      <title>Stochastic convergence of a class of greedy-type algorithms for Configuration Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Greedy Sampling Methods (GSMs) are widely used to construct approximate solutions of Configuration Optimization Problems (COPs), where a loss functional is minimized over finite configurations of points in a compact domain. While effective in practice, deterministic convergence analyses of greedy-type algorithms are often restrictive and difficult to verify. We propose a stochastic framework in which greedy-type methods are formulated as continuous-time Markov processes on the space of configurations. This viewpoint enables convergence analysis in expectation and in probability under mild structural assumptions on the error functional and the transition kernel. For global error functionals, we derive explicit convergence rates, including logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay, depending on an abstract improvement condition. As a pedagogical example, we study stochastic greedy sampling for one-dimensional piecewise linear interpolation and prove exponential convergence of the $L^1$-interpolation error for $C^2$-functions. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Randomized Polytope Division Method (R-PDM), a randomized variant of the classical Polytope Division Method, and demonstrate its effectiveness and variance reduction in numerical experiments</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Averages of Plancherel Random Partitions: Elliptic Functions, Phase Transitions, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random integer partitions~$\lambda$ that follow the Poissonized Plancherel measure of parameter~$t^2$. Using Riemann--Hilbert techniques, we establish the asymptotics of the multiplicative averages \[ Q(t,s)=\mathbb{E} \left[ \prod_{i\geq 1} \left(1+\e^{\eta(\lambda_i-i+\frac{1}{2}-s)}\right)^{-1} \right] \] for fixed $\eta&gt;0$ in the regime $t\to+\infty$ and $s/t=O(1)$. We compute the large-$t$ expansion of $\log Q(t,xt)$ expressing the rate function $\mathcal{F}(x) = -\lim_{t \to \infty}t^{-2}\log Q(t,xt)$ and the subsequent divergent and oscillatory contributions explicitly in terms of elliptic theta functions. The associated equilibrium measure presents, in general, nontrivial saturated regions and it undergoes two third-order phase transitions of different nature which we describe. Applications of our results include an explicit characterization of tail probabilities of the height function of the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth model and of the edge of the positive-temperature discrete Bessel process and asymptotics of radially symmetric solutions to the 2D~Toda equation with step-like shock initial data.</description>

      <title>A complete characterization of testable hypotheses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a fundamental question in hypothesis testing: given two sets of probability measures $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, when does a nontrivial (i.e.\ strictly unbiased) test for $\mathcal{P}$ against $\mathcal{Q}$ exist? Le~Cam showed that, when $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ have a common dominating measure, a test that has power exceeding its level by more than $\varepsilon$ exists if and only if the convex hulls of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are separated in total variation distance by more than $\varepsilon$. The requirement of a dominating measure is frequently violated in nonparametric statistics. In a passing remark, Le~Cam described an approach to address more general scenarios, but he stopped short of stating a formal theorem. This work completes Le~Cam's program, by presenting a matching necessary and sufficient condition for testability: for the aforementioned theorem to hold without assumptions, one must take the closures of the convex hulls of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ in the space of bounded finitely additive measures. We provide simple elucidating examples, and elaborate on various subtle measure theoretic and topological points regarding compactness and achievability.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Definition of the Integral and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard definition of integration of differential forms is based on local coordinates and partitions of unity. This definition is mostly a formality and not used used in explicit computations or approximation schemes. We present a definition of the integral that uses triangulations instead. Our definition is a coordinate-free version of the standard definition of the Riemann integral on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and we argue that it is the natural definition in the contexts of Lie algebroids, stochastic integration and quantum field theory, where path integrals are defined using lattices. In particular, our definition naturally incorporates the different stochastic integrals, which involve integration over H\"{o}lder continuous paths. Furthermore, our definition is well-adapted to establishing integral identities from their combinatorial counterparts. Our construction is based on the observation that, in great generality, the things that are integrated are determined by cochains on the pair groupoid. Abstractly, our definition uses the van Est map to lift a differential form to the pair groupoid. Our construction suggests a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus which we prove: the singular cohomology and de Rham cohomology cap products of a cocycle with the fundamental class are equal.</description>

      <title>A new stochastic SIS-type modelling framework for analysing epidemic dynamics in continuous space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic epidemiological model defined in a continuous space of arbitrary dimension, based on SIS dynamics implemented in a spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot (SLFV) process. The model can be described by as little as three parameters, and is dual to a spatial branching process with competition linked to genealogies of infected individuals. Therefore, it is a possible modelling framework to develop computationally tractable inference tools for epidemics in a continuous space using demographic and genetic data.We provide mathematical constructions of the process based on well-posed martingale problems as well as driving space-time Poisson point processes. With these devices and the duality relation in hand, we unveil some of the drivers of the transition between extinction and survival of the epidemic. In particular, we show that extinction is in large parts independent of the initial condition, and identify a strong candidate for the reproduction number R 0 of the epidemic in such a model.</description>

Abstract: We construct a one-parameter family of infinite line ensembles on $[0, \infty)$ that are natural half-space analogues of the Airy line ensemble. Away from the origin these ensembles are locally described by avoiding Brownian bridges, and near the origin they are described by a sequence of avoiding reverse Brownian motions with alternating drifts, that depend on the parameter of the model. In addition, the restrictions of our ensembles to finitely many vertical lines form Pfaffian point processes with the crossover kernels obtained by Baik-Barraquand-Corwin-Suidan (Ann. Probab., 46(6), 3015-3089, 2018)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generalized model of elephant random walks wherein the walker, during the $(n+1)$-st time-stamp, draws from the past (i.e. the set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$) a sample of $k$ time-stamps, either with replacement or without, where $k$ may either remain fixed as $n$ grows, or $k=k(n)$ may grow with $n$. Letting $\{U_{n,1}, U_{n,2}, \ldots, U_{n,k}\}$ denote the time-stamps sampled, the step taken by the walker during the $(n+1)$-st time-stamp, denoted $X_{n+1}$, is a $\pm 1$-valued random variable whose distribution depends on the proportion of $(+1)$-valued steps out of $X_{U_{n,1}},X_{U_{n,2}},\ldots,X_{U_{n,k}}$ via a reinforcement function $f$. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour, i.e. strong and weak convergence, of this random walk model under suitable assumptions made on the function $f$ (as well as on the sequence $\{k(n)\}$ when the sample size varies with $n$).</description>

      <title>Ergodicity bounds in the Sliced Wasserstein distance for Schur stable autoregressive processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit calculations in dimension one show for Schur stable autoregressive processes with standard Gaussian noise that the ergodic convergence in the Wasserstein-$2$ distance is essentially given by the sum of the mean, which decays exponentially, and the standard deviation, which decays with twice the speed. This paper starts by showing new upper and lower multivariate affine transport bounds for the Wasserstein-$r$ distance for $r$ greater and equal to $1$. These bounds allow to formulate a novel sufficient (non-Gaussian) ergodic interpolation condition for the mentioned mean-variance behavior to take place in case of more general Schur stable multivariate autoregressive processes. All ergodic estimates are non-asymptotic with completely explicit constants. The main applications are precise thermalization bounds for Schur stable $\mathsf{AR}(p)$ and $\mathsf{ARMA}(p,q)$ models in Wasserstein and Sliced Wasserstein distance. In the sequel we establish with the help of coupling techniques explicit upper and lower exponential bounds for more general multivariate Schur stable autoregressive processes. This includes parallel sampling and the convergence of the empiricial means. The utility of our results in particular for the Sliced Wasserstein distance are confirmed by multivariate numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Zero distribution of multiplicative Hermite and Laguerre polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that, as $n\to\infty$, the zero distribution of the $n$-th Hermite polynomial converges to the semicircular law (the free normal distribution), while the zero distribution of the associated Laguerre polynomials converges to the Marchenko--Pastur law (the free Poisson distribution). In this paper, we establish multiplicative analogues of these results. We define the multiplicative Hermite and Laguerre polynomials by \begin{align*} H_n^*(x;s) &amp;:= e^{-\frac 12 s ((x\partial_x)^2 - n x \partial_x) } (x-1)^n = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom nj e^{-\frac 12 s (j^2 - nj)} x^j, \\ L_n^*(x; b,c) &amp;:= (x\partial_x + b)^c (x-1)^n = \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^{n-j} \binom nj (j+b)^c x^j, \end{align*} where $n\in \mathbb N_0$, $\partial_x$ denotes the differentiation operator w.r.t. $x$, and $s\in \mathbb R$, $b\in \mathbb C$, $c\in \mathbb N_0$ are parameters. In the Hermite case, we show that, as $n\to\infty$, the zero distribution of $H_n^*(x;s/n)$ converges weakly to the free multiplicative normal distribution on the positive half-line (when $s&gt;0$) or to the free unitary normal distribution on the unit circle $\{|z| = 1\}$ (when $s&lt;0$). In the Laguerre case, we show that the zero distribution of $L_n^*(x; n\beta, \lfloor n \gamma \rfloor)$ converges to the free multiplicative Poisson distribution on the positive half-line (when $\gamma &gt;0$ and $\beta \in \mathbb R\backslash[0,1]$) or on the unit circle (when $\gamma&gt;0$ and $\beta \in -\frac 12 + \sqrt{-1} \, \mathbb R$). All these results are obtained by essentially the same method, which treats the Hermite/Laguerre cases and the unitary/positive settings in a unified way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Brownian motion on complex partial flag manifolds with blocks of equal size as a matrix-valued diffusion from a Brownian motion on the unitary group. This construction leads to an explicit expression for the characteristic function of the joint distribution of the stochastic areas on these manifolds. The limit law of these stochastic areas is shown to be a multivariate Cauchy distribution with independent and identically distributed entries. By relating the area functionals on flag manifolds to the winding functional on the complex Stiefel manifold, we establish new results about simultaneous Brownian windings on the complex Stiefel manifold. To establish these results, this work introduces a new family of diffusions, which generalise both the Jacobi processes on the simplex and the Hermitian Jacobi processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the expected star discrepancy under a newly designed class of convex equivolume partition models. The main contributions are two-fold. First, we establish a strong partition principle for the star discrepancy, showing that our newly designed partitions yield stratified sampling point sets with lower expected star discrepancy than both classical jittered sampling and simple random sampling. Specifically, we prove that $\mathbb{E}(D^{*}_{N}(Z))\leq\mathbb{E}(D^{*}_{N}(Y))&lt;\mathbb{E}(D^{*}_{N}(X))$, where $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ represent simple random sampling, jittered sampling, and our new partition sampling, respectively. Second, we derive explicit upper bounds for the expected star discrepancy under our partition models, which improve upon existing bounds for jittered sampling. Our results resolve Open Question 2 posed in Kiderlen and Pausinger (2021) regarding the strong partition principle for star discrepancy.</description>

Abstract: We establish sharp large deviation asymptotics for the maximum order statistic of independent and identically distributed heavy-tailed random variables, valid for all Borel subsets of the right tail. This result yields exact decay rates for exceedance probabilities at thresholds that grow faster than the natural extreme-value scaling. As an application, we derive the polynomial rate of decay of ruin probabilities in insurance portfolios where insolvency is driven by a single extreme claim.</description>

We additionally prove a new approximation result, showing that the total variation distance between random P\'olya trees and random unlabelled trees tends to zero when the number of vertices tends to infinity. In order to demonstrate that our approach is not restricted to trees we extend our results to tree-like classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectral gap of adaptive Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a degenerated Fokker-Planck type differential operator associated to an adaptive Langevin dynamic. We prove Eyring-Kramers formulas for the bottom of the spectrum of this operator in the low temperature regime. The main ingredients are resolvent estimates obtained via hypocoercive techniques and the construction of sharp Gaussian quasimodes through an adaptation of the WKB method.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the stochastic thin-film equation with an interface potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider strictly positive solutions to a class of fourth-order conservative quasilinear SPDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus modeled after the stochastic thin-film equation. We prove local Lipschitz estimates in Bessel potential spaces under minimal assumptions on the parameters and corresponding stochastic maximal $L^p$-regularity estimates for thin-film type operators with measurable in-time coefficients. As a result, we deduce local well-posedness of the stochastic thin-film equation as well as blow-up criteria and instantaneous regularization for the solution. In dimension one, we additionally close $\alpha$-entropy estimates and subsequently an energy estimate for the stochastic thin-film equation with an interface potential so that global well-posedness follows. We allow for a wide range of mobility functions including the power laws $u^n$ for $n\in [0,6)$ as long as the interface potential is sufficiently repulsive.</description>

Abstract: We consider Witten Laplacians associated to some non-Morse potentials. We prove Eyring-Kramers formulas for the bottom of the spectrum of these operators in the semiclassical regime and quantify the spectral gap separating these eigenvalues from the rest of the spectrum. The main ingredient is the construction of sharp degenerate Gaussian quasimodes through an adaptation of the WKB method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical friendship paradox which states that on an average ones friends have at least as many friends as oneself and generalize it to a variety of network centrality indices. For a broad class of spectral centralities on connected undirected graphs degree, eigenvector centrality, walk counts, Katz centrality and PageRank, we show that the average centrality of a nodes neighbours always exceeds the global average centrality.</description>

      <title>An Incentive-Compatible Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols have been suggested in the literature to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>A local limit theorem for a random walk in an intermittent dynamical environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an extended dynamical system on the non-negative real line with piecewise linear non-uniformly expanding local dynamics. With a uniformly distributed initial state, the distribution of successive states coincides with that of a random walk in an inhomogeneous environment. Under suitable conditions on the environment, we establish a central limit theorem and a (non-Gaussian) local limit theorem for the walk. Our approach builds on the work of Leskel\"a and Stenlund (Stochastic Process. Appl. 121(12), 2011), who analyzed a corresponding model with uniformly expanding local dynamics.</description>

      <title>Expected star discrepancy based on stratified sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two main contributions to the expected star discrepancy theory. First, we derive a sharper expected upper bound for jittered sampling, improving the leading constants and logarithmic terms compared to the state-of-the-art [Doerr, 2022]. Second, we prove the strong partition principle for star discrepancy, showing that any equal-measure stratified sampling yields a strictly smaller expected discrepancy than simple random sampling, thereby resolving an open question in [Kiderlen and Pausinger, 2022]. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical advances and illustrate the superiority of stratified sampling in low to moderate dimensions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport, Timesteppers, Newton-Krylov Methods and Steady States of Collective Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timesteppers constitute a powerful tool in modern computational science and engineering. Although they are typically used to advance the system forward in time, they can also be viewed as nonlinear mappings that implicitly encode steady states and stability information. In this work, we present an extension of the matrix-free framework for calculating, via timesteppers, steady states of deterministic systems to stochastic particle simulations, where intrinsic randomness prevents direct steady state extraction. By formulating stochastic timesteppers in the language of optimal transport, we reinterpret them as operators acting on probability measures rather than on individual particle trajectories. This perspective enables the construction of smooth cumulative- and inverse-cumulative-distribution-function ((I)CDF) timesteppers that evolve distributions rather than particles. Combined with matrix-free Newton-Krylov solvers, these smooth timesteppers allow efficient computation of steady-state distributions even under high stochastic noise. We perform an error analysis quantifying how noise affects finite-difference Jacobian action approximations, and demonstrate that convergence can be obtained even in high noise regimes. Finally, we introduce higher-dimensional generalizations based on smooth CDF-related representations of particles and validate their performance on a non-trivial two-dimensional distribution. Together, these developments establish a unified variational framework for computing meaningful steady states of both deterministic and stochastic timesteppers.</description>
