      <title>Exploring substructures in the Milky Way halo Neural networks applied to Gaia and APOGEE DR 17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of stellar structures in the Galactic halo, including stellar streams and merger remnants, often relies on the dynamics of their constituent stars. However, this approach has limitations due to the complex dynamical interactions between these structures and their environment. Perturbations such as tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way, the potential escape of stars, and passages through the Galactic plane can result in the loss of dynamical coherence of stars in these structures. Consequently, relying solely on dynamics may be insufficient for detecting such disrupted or dispersed remnants. We combine chemistry and dynamics, integrated through a system of neural networks, to develop a clustering method for identifying accreted structures in the Galactic halo. We developed an integrated approach combining Siamese neural networks (SNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), autoencoders, and the OPTICS algorithm to create a comprehensive procedure named CREEK. This method is designed to uncover stellar structures in the Galactic halo. Initially, CREEK was trained on known globular clusters (GCs) and then applied to the dataset to identify stellar streams. CREEK successfully recovered 80% of the GCs present in the APOGEE dataset, re-identified several known stellar streams, and identified a potential new stream. Additionally, within highly populated stellar structures, CREEK can identify substructures that exhibit distinct chemical compositions and orbital energies. This approach provides an objective data-driven method for selecting stars associated with streams and stellar structures in general.</description>

      <title>MIRACLE II: Unveiling the multi-phase gas interplay in the circumnuclear region of NGC 1365 via multi-cloud modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases.
  MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material.
  The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions.
  Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.
  For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.</description>

      <title>Dissecting NGC 3132: Tracing the mass-loss history of the southern ring planetary nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central to our understanding of stellar evolution and its impact on processes in our Galaxy and across the Universe is the study of mass loss. While the general framework is well established, recent JWST observations of objects like NGC 3132 have revealed intricate nebular structures, suggesting complex mass-loss processes likely driven by multiple star system at its core. These findings pose new challenges for the currently available investigation tools. The primary goal of this study is the first detailed comparison of the physical properties and chemical composition obtained for NGC 3132, based on the latest detailed 3D model and observations from MUSE, JWST and Spitzer. We evaluate the reliability of the traditional empirical method and photoionization model for abundances estimations, both based on the same available high-quality, spatially resolved observations. We find that the model and empirical method yield consistent results for the integrated total properties such as Te, ne and chemical abundances. However, when applied to simulated observations from the model, the empirical method fails to recover the model input abundances, providing only an approximate estimate. This discrepancy arises in part from the loss of information when summing fluxes over regions which have complex ionisation structures. This discrepancy in the case of oxygen has been estimated to be up to 35%. Moreover, the latest IR data reveal a spatial correlation between H2, c(Hb) as well as the [8.0]/[4.5] IRAC ratio. Finally, new clumps are discovered in [Ni II] 7378 \AA, [Fe II] 8617 \AA and [Fe III] 5270 \AA emission lines.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption Event Demographics in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Over Cosmic Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) offer a unique probe of supermassive black hole (SMBH) demographics, but their observed rates remain difficult to reconcile with standard single-SMBH models. In this work, we use simulations of SMBH binaries, including the combined effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov oscillations and two-body relaxation, to explore how TDE rates scale with SMBH mass and redshift. We find that binary systems exhibit increasing TDE rates with mass, in contrast to the declining trend expected for single SMBHs. These binary-driven rates match those observed in post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that a subset of TDE hosts may contain SMBH binaries. TDE light curves in some massive galaxies exhibit unexpectedly short durations, suggesting that the disrupting SMBH may be less massive than implied by host galaxy scaling relations, consistent with disruptions by the less massive black hole in a binary. By convolving our mass-dependent rates with the SMBH mass function, we predict redshift-dependent TDE rates, which we show can be used to constrain the supermassive black hole binary fraction. Our results provide a testable framework for interpreting TDE demographics in upcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST and Roman.</description>

      <title>Reverberation Mapping Data of NGC 5548 Imply a Multicomponent Broad-Line Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line broadening and variability are observational hallmarks of active galactic nuclei which allow us to measure supermassive black hole masses as well as constrain the geometry and kinematics of the emitting gas, with the most precise measurements requiring a degree of modeling. Two popular models of the broad-line region describe the emitting gas as either a distribution of puffed up clouds or a thin disk with strong velocity gradients. As we show in this work, key features in the reverberation mapping dataset obtained by the AGN STORM team in NGC 5548 cannot be accounted for by either simple model. In several emission lines the observed broad-line profile has a single peak yet the delay profile has a distinct double peak, strongly motivating a BLR with emission from multiple components. We demonstrate a few possibilities that may alleviate the tension and better represent the true nature of the broad-line emitting gas in NGC 5548 and beyond.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of Warm Dust in the Circumgalactic Medium of the Makani Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of near- and mid-infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out to ~ 35 kpc in the Makani Galaxy, a compact massive galaxy with a record-breaking 100-kpc scale starburst-driven wind at redshift z = 0.459. The NIRCam and MIRI observations with JWST take advantage of a coincidental match between the PAH spectral features at 3.3, 7.7, and (11.3 + 12.2) microns in Makani and the bandpasses of the MIRI and NIRCam filters. The warm dust is not only detected in the cool-gas tracers of the galactic wind associated with the more recent (7 Myr) starburst episode, but also in the outer warm-ionized gas wind produced by the older (0.4 Gyr) episode. The presence of PAHs in the outer wind indicates that the PAHs have survived the long (R/v ~ 10^8 yrs) journey to the halo despite the harsh environment of the galactic wind. The measured F1800W/F1130W flux ratios in the unresolved nucleus, inner halo (R = 10 - 20 kpc), and outer halo (R = 20 - 35 kpc), tracers of the PAH (11.3 + 12.2)/7.7 ratios, indicate decreasing starlight intensity incident on the PAHs, decreasing PAH sizes, and increasing PAH ionization fractions with increasing distance from the nucleus. These data provide the strongest evidence to date that the ejected dust of galactic winds survives the long journey to the CGM, but is eroded along the way.</description>

      <title>SILCC -- IX. The multi-phase interstellar medium at low metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas-phase metallicity affects heating and cooling processes in the star-forming galactic interstellar medium (ISM) as well as ionising luminosities, wind strengths, and lifetimes of massive stars. To investigate its impact, we conduct magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ISM using the FLASH code as part of the SILCC project. The simulations assume a gas surface density of 10 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and span metallicities from 1/50 Z$_\odot$ to 1 Z$_\odot$. We include non-equilibrium thermo-chemistry, a space- and time-variable far-UV background and cosmic ray ionisation rate, metal-dependent stellar tracks, the formation of HII regions, stellar winds, type II supernovae, and cosmic ray injection and transport. With the metallicity decreasing over the investigated range, the star formation rate decreases by more than a factor of ten, the mass fraction of cold gas decreases from 60% to 2.3%, while the volume filling fraction of the warm gas increases from 20% to 80%. Furthermore, the fraction of H$_\mathrm{2}$ in the densest regions drops by a factor of four, and the dense ISM fragments into approximately five times fewer structures at the lowest metallicity. Outflow mass loading factors remain largely unchanged, with values close to unity, except for a significant decline at the lowest metallicity. Including the major processes that regulate ISM properties, this study highlights the strong impact of gas phase metallicity on the star-forming ISM.</description>

      <title>A group of merging galaxies falling onto Abell 2142</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters produce a very hostile environment to galaxies, whose gas gets stripped by ram-pressure, suffer galaxy interactions and witness quenching of their star formation. Clusters, like Abell 2142, grow not only through galaxy accretion but also through group infall. Our goal is to study the physical and dynamical state of the most conspicuous infalling group, on a filament projected at 1.3 Mpc from the Abell 2142 centre. The galaxy group is the leading edge of a spectacular trailing 700-kpc-long X-ray tail of hot gas stripped by ram-pressure. The infalling galaxies are not quenched yet, and are ideal objects to study the transformation processes due to the cluster environment. We use integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA to derive stellar and gas kinematics, and MegaCam for ugr photometry. Stellar populations (with age and metallicity) are obtained through full-spectrum fitting using Nburst. The gas kinematics and excitation are derived from the line emission of H$\alpha$, [NII], [OIII] and H$\beta$. The group contains four galaxies, of which two are merging and partly superposing on the line of sight. With a simple parametric model for each velocity field, we succeed in disentangling the contribution of each galaxy and derive their physical state and kinematics. The galaxies are perturbed, and intra-group gas is observed as tidal tails and loops. They are mainly disks in rotation, although some regions reveal elevated dispersion, typical of out-of-equilibrium gas. All galaxies show sustained star formation, with a global star formation rate of 45 M$_\odot$/yr. We conclude that the long X-ray tail must have come from the hot intra-group medium, present before the group infall, and does not correspond to the ram-pressure stripping of the galaxy gas. The galaxy interactions within the group are still enhancing the star formation, from the disks that are still rich in dense gas.</description>

      <title>BASS XLVIII: [Ne v] {\lambda}3427 Emission in Powerful Nearby Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the high-ionization, narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line in a sample of over 340 ultrahard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) drawn from the BASS project. The analysis includes measurements in individual and stacked spectra, and considers several key AGN properties such as X-ray luminosity, supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratios, and line-of-sight column density. The [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line is robustly detected in ~43% (146/341) of the AGN in our sample, with no significant trends between the detection rate and key AGN/SMBH properties. In particular, the detection rate remains high even at the highest levels of obscuration (&gt;70% for log[N_H/cm^-2] &gt; 23). On the other hand, even some of our highest signal-to-noise spectra (S/N &gt; 50) lack a robust [Ne v] detection. The typical (median) scaling ratios between [Ne v] line emission and (ultra-)hard X-ray emission in our sample are log L[Ne v]/L(14-150 keV) = -3.75 and log L[Ne v]/L(2-10 keV) = -3.36. The scatter on these scaling ratios, of ~0.5 dex, is comparable to, and indeed smaller than, what is found for other commonly used tracers of AGN radiative outputs (e.g., [O III] $\lambda$5007). Otherwise, we find no significant relations between the (relative) strength of [Ne v] and the basic AGN/SMBH properties under study, in contrast with simple expectations from models of SMBH accretion flows. Our results reaffirm the usability of [Ne v] as an AGN tracer even in highly obscured systems, including dual AGN and high redshift sources.</description>

      <title>The JWST Spectroscopic Properties of Galaxies at $z=9-14$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08245v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the JWST spectra of $61$ galaxies at $z=9-14$, including $30$ newly-confirmed galaxies. We directly compare the $z&gt;9$ spectroscopic properties against $401$ galaxies at $6&lt;z&lt;9$, with the goal of identifying evolution in the star formation histories and ISM. We measure rest-UV emission line properties and UV continuum slopes, while also investigating the rest-optical emission lines for the subset of galaxies at $9.0&lt;z&lt;9.6$. With these spectra, we constrain the stellar masses, specific star formation rates, dust attenuation, and the average metallicity and abundance pattern of $z&gt;9$ galaxies. Our dataset indicates that the emission lines undergo a marked change at $z&gt;9$, with extremely large CIII], H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$ EWs becoming $2-3\times$ more common at $z&gt;9$ relative to $6&lt;z&lt;9$. Using the spectra, we infer the distribution of SFRs on short (SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$) and medium (SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$) timescales, finding that rapid SFR upturns (large SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$ ratios) are significantly more likely among $z&gt;9$ galaxies. These results may reflect a larger dispersion in UV luminosity at fixed halo mass and larger baryon accretion rates at $z&gt;9$, although other physical effects may also contribute. We suggest that the shift in star formation conditions explains the prevalence of extreme nebular spectra that have been detected at $z&gt;9$, with hard ionizing sources and nitrogen-enhancements becoming more typical at the highest redshifts. Finally, we identify five $z&gt;9$ spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with red UV colors ($\beta\gtrsim-1.5$), either revealing a small population with moderate dust attenuation ($\tau_V=0.23-0.35$) or very high density nebular-dominated galaxies with hot stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Obscured and unobscured X-ray AGNs I: Host galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by influencing the observational properties of their host galaxies. We investigate the host galaxy properties of X-ray selected AGNs, focusing on differences between obscured and unobscured AGNs, and between high-(log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$}$&gt;$0.5) and low-excitation sources (log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$$&lt;$0.5). We selected a sample of AGNs from the spectroscopic zCOSMOS survey with 0.5 $&lt; zsp &lt;$ 0.9 based on the Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagram and X-ray emission. AGNs were classified as obscured or unobscured using hydrogen column density, and as high- or low-excitation based on the [OIII]5007/H$\beta$ ratio. We analysed various AGN properties, including the hardness ratio, X-ray luminosity, emission line ratios such as the ionisation-level sensitive parameter O32=log([OIII]5007/[OII]3727), and the metallicity sensitive parameter R23=log(([OIII]5007+[OII]3727/H$\beta$), and the specific black hole accretion rate. Unobscured AGNs exhibit a more evident correlation between the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ionisation ratio and X-ray luminosity than obscured AGNs, while high-excitation obscured AGNs reach, on average, higher X-ray luminosities. Furthermore, high-excitation AGNs typically show high values of R23, suggesting low metallicities, similar to that observed in high-redshift galaxies (4 $&lt; z &lt;$ 6). We find a positive correlation between the parameters $\lambda$sBHAR and N$_H$, R23 and O32 parameters. The correlation suggests that AGNs with a high specific accretion rate have not only a higher production of high-energy photons, which ionise the surrounding medium more intensely, but are also usually associated with environments less enriched in heavy elements.

      <title>A new type-1 transition in NGC 1346 revealed by (spectro)polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first photo- and spectropolarimetric observations of the changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC~1346 taken with the Perkins telescope (November 2022, March 2025) and VLT/FORS2 (August and September 2024), which have revealed a new spectral transition. We find that NGC~1346 has reverted to its former (2001) type-1 spectral state after having been a type-2 active galactic nucleus from 2004 to 2022. More and more intense broad H$\beta$ (3720 $\pm$ 310 km.s$^{-1}$ full width at half maximum) and H$\alpha$ (2985 $\pm$ 230 km.s$^{-1}$) emission lines appeared between August and September 2024, suggesting that the broad-line region (BLR) is increasingly irradiated. The strong blueshift of the Balmer lines ($\sim$ 1600 km.s$^{-1}$) indicates that the gas is moving toward the observer, possibly due to a radiation-driven outflow. The strong difference between 2022's ($\sim$ 3\%) and 2024-2025's de-biased polarization ($\le$ 0.5\%), the blueing of the spectra between August and September 2024, and the slow rise in the integrated flux between 2022 and 2025 argue against asymmetric or temporary obscuration by a cloud passing in front of the line of sight. Two options, either a re-illumination of the BLR or a tidal disruption event, can explain the observed properties of NGC~1346. Timely follow-up observations taken while the phenomenon is still ongoing are needed to determine which of the two solutions is the correct one.</description>

      <title>UNIONS Optical Identifications for VLASS Radio Sources in the Euclid Sky (UNVEIL) I. A Catalog of ~146,000 Radio Galaxies up to z~5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of optical identifications for Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) radio sources using the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). A cross-match between UNIONS and VLASS Epoch 2 catalogs yields 146,212 radio galaxies down to $r=24.5$ mag over a wide area of $\sim4,200\ \mathrm{deg^2}$. We perform g-dropout selections and find $&gt;200$ sources at $z\sim4$ optimistically. Of 63,019 sources with valid photo-$z$, 8,692 are at $z_\mathrm{photo}&gt;1$, and 1,171 are at $z_\mathrm{photo}&gt;2$. Based on spectral luminosities at 1.4 GHz using the valid photo-$z$, we identify $\sim49,000$ radio-loud AGNs (RLAGNs) with $\textit{L}_\mathrm{1.4GHz}&gt;10^{24}$ W/Hz, and all radio galaxies at $z&gt;1$ are RL. Adopting radio loudness instead, 138,266 out of 146,212 UNIONS-VLASS radio galaxies are RL. Thus, our catalog greatly increases the number counts of RLAGNs at $z&gt;1$. We further cross-match the UNIONS-VLASS catalog with LOw-Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144 MHz and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) at 1.4 GHz, yielding 101,671 UNIONS-VLASS-LoTSS, 79,638 -FIRST, and 64,672 -LoTSS-FIRST sources, respectively. This multifrequency radio dataset reveals sources of various spectral shapes, including the steep spectrum of aged populations, the peaked spectrum of young populations, and the upturned spectrum potentially associated with transient sources. The UNIONS-VLASS radio galaxies will be covered by the Euclid wide survey, offering legacy values to benefit multi-faceted studies related to RLAGNs and beyond.</description>

      <title>Nature or Nurture: LMC-like Dust in the Solar Metallicity Galaxy M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, ultraviolet (UV) extinction curves have been measured in M31 along thirteen new sightlines, increasing the M31 sample to seventeen. This sample covers a wide area of M31 having galactocentric distances of 5 to 16 kpc, enabling the analysis of UV extinction curve variations over a large region of an external galaxy similar to the Milky Way with global galactic characteristics such as metallicity for the first time. No correlation is found between the extinction parameters and galactocentric distance which might be expected if there is a radial metallicity gradient in M31. Most of the new UV extinction curves presented here are significantly different from the average extinction curves of the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC, but the average M31 extinction curve is similar to the average extinction curve in the 30-Dor region of the LMC. The wide range of extinction curves seen in each individual Local Group galaxy suggests that global galactic properties such as metallicity may be less important than the local environmental conditions such as density, UV radiation field, and shocks along each sightline. The combined behavior of the Milky Way, LMC, SMC, and now M31 UV extinction curves supports the idea that there is a family of curves in the Local Group with overlapping dust grain properties between different galaxies.</description>

      <title>Metal-THINGS: gas metallicity gradients in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the gas metallicity gradients in a sample of 25 nearby galaxies using new Integral Field Spectroscopy observations from the Metal-THINGS survey. We derive and study the resolved diffuse ionised gas content, Baldwin, Phillips and Terlevich diagrams and gas metallicities for our entire sample, at spatial resolutions of 40-300 pc. Gas metallicity gradients are studied as a function of the galaxy's stellar mass, H I gas fraction, diffuse ionised gas content, and using different parametric length scales for normalisation. The metallicity gradients are analysed using Bayesian statistics based on data from the Metal-THINGS survey. Bayesian MCMC models are developed to explore how metallicity gradients vary with a galaxy's mass and how they correlate with properties such as the stellar mass or the atomic gas fraction. For our sample, we find that the metallicity typically decreases with galactic radius, consistent with inside-out galaxy growth. We find a trend dependent on the stellar mass, with a break at log(M_star/M_sun)=9.5, and another between the metallicity gradients and the atomic gas fraction (f_g,HI) of a galaxy at fg,HI=0.75, indicating relatively shallower gradients for lower gas fractions. We find that normalisation using NUV-band effective radii are preferable for galaxies with a higher atomic gas content and lower stellar masses, while r-band radii are better suited for those with lower atomic gas fractions and more massive ones. Our results highlight a strong connection between gas content, stellar mass, and metallicity gradients. The breaks at log(M_star/M_sun)=9.5 and fg,HI=0.75 mark shifts in chemical enrichment behaviour, with low-mass galaxies showing greater sensitivity to gas processes. Overall, this points to gas accretion and removal as key drivers of chemical evolution in low-mass systems.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundances and small-scale gas kinematics in the local star-forming galaxy NGC 2366</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed spectroscopic study of ionised gas in the nearby (~3.3Mpc) dwarf galaxy NGC 2366, a local analogue of Green Pea galaxies, based on observations with the SCORPIO-2 instrument at the Russian 6-m BTA telescope. Using scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry and long-slit spectroscopy, we examine the gas kinematics, excitation mechanisms, and chemical abundances across the disc of NGC 2366, including its prominent starburst region Mrk 71 and the companion region NGC 2363. We identified 20 regions with locally elevated Ha velocity dispersion, only four of which correspond to known high-energy sources. We argue that one of the remaining objects can be a previously unidentified Wolf-Rayet star and two - supernova remnants. For 15 HII regions, we measure electron temperatures, oxygen and nitrogen abundances via the `direct' Te method, with 12 + log(O/H) ranging from 7.6 to 8.0 in most of the regions. We show that Mrk 71 has higher oxygen abundance compared to the other \HII regions in the galaxy, contrary to the previous indirect estimates suggesting flat gradient throughout the galaxy. Together with the localized spatial variations of metallicity in the area, it is indicative of metal enrichment by the outflow from the super star cluster in the centre of Mrk 71.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Mystery N/O more -- uncovering the origin of peculiar chemical abundances and a not-so-fundamental metallicity relation at $3&lt;z&lt;12$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of metallicities and chemical abundances at $3&lt;z&lt;12$ in the THESAN-ZOOM simulations. We find that smoothly curved gas-phase and stellar mass-metallicity relations (MZR) are already in place at $z\approx12$ and evolve slowly ($\sim$0.2 dex increase for gas, $\sim$0.4 dex increase for stars at a fixed stellar mass) down to $z=3$, governed largely by the efficiency with which galaxies retain their metals, rather than gas fraction. The canonical fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) survives in stars but breaks down and inverts for gas in low-mass galaxies ($M_\ast\lesssim10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$) due to regular dilution by low-metallicity gas inflow. We find broad agreement of gas-phase N/O, Fe/O, and C/O with high-redshift observations, including the presence of nitrogen-rich galaxies (NRGs; $\log(\mathrm{N/O})&gt;-0.6$) without the need for exotic yields in our chemical network. Instead, bursty star formation naturally generates order-of-magnitude excursions in N/O on $\lesssim$100 Myr timescales due to temporally differential galactic winds; after a starburst, stellar feedback expels gas, leaving a large population of asymptotic-giant-branch stars to dominate the enrichment of the relatively low-mass interstellar medium. NRGs lie below the main sequence and typically exhibit $\mathrm{EW}[H$\beta$]\lesssim40$ \r{A}, in apparent tension with observed high-EW NRGs. This tension is reconciled if observed NRGs are in the initial stages of a subsequent starburst, illuminating previously enriched gas, which is supported by the finding of high SFR surface density nitrogen-rich giant molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Triggering and quenching in the shadow of AGN: How does AGN proximity affect star formation in the EAGLE simulation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and mechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its influence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment remains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star formation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample matched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven environmental effects, quantified through the $\Delta$SFR offset defined as the difference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched controls. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\%$ of AGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\%$ exhibit enhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the trends are statistically robust and consistent across the population. Suppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos, consistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally trigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN feedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such models can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings demonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting neighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent manner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often overlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale structures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale environmental regulation.</description>

      <title>The Kinematic Age of 3I/ATLAS and its Implications for Early Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the third interstellar object (3I/ATLAS) expands the known census from two to three and significantly improves statistical inferences regarding the underlying galactic population. 3I/ATLAS exhibits detectable activity that may increase as the object approaches perihelion. In this paper, we argue that the cometary activity likely significantly contributes to 3I/ATLAS's brightness, since the nuclear size of 3I/ATLAS assuming an asteroidal reflectance implies an untenable interstellar object mass per star. 3I/ATLAS exhibits an excess velocity of $v_\infty=58$ km/s relative to the Sun which is significantly larger than that of 1I/`Oumuamua or 2I/Borisov. This velocity implies that 3I/ATLAS is relatively old in comparison to previous interstellar objects. Here, we calculate the posterior distribution of ages implied by the kinematics of the interstellar objects and find that 3I/ATLAS is likely $\sim3-11$ Gyr old, assuming that the interstellar object and stellar age-velocity relations are equivalent. We also calculate the distribution of host star metallicities and find that 3I/ATLAS likely originated in a lower-metallicity system than the previous interstellar objects. These results show that interstellar object formation is likely efficient at low metallicities and early in the history of the Galaxy. Finally, we estimate and approximate interstellar object formation rate throughout Galactic history implied by these three objects.</description>

      <title>The Blue Lurker WOCS 14020: A Long-Period Post-Common-Envelope Binary in M67 Originating from a Merger in a Triple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of a blue-lurker$-$white-dwarf (BL-WD) binary system in the 4 Gyr open cluster M67. We fit the FUV spectrum of the WD, determining it is a C/O WD with a mass of $0.72^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$ and a cooling age of $\sim400$ Myr. This requires a WD progenitor of $\sim3$ M$_\odot$, significantly larger than the current cluster turnoff mass of 1.3 M$_\odot$. We suggest the WD progenitor star formed several hundred Myr ago via the merger of two stars near the turnoff of the cluster. In this scenario, the original progenitor system was a hierarchical triple consisting of a close, near-equal-mass inner binary, with a tertiary companion with an orbit of a few thousand days. The WD is descended from the merged inner binary, and the original tertiary is now the observed BL. The likely formation scenario involves a common envelope while the WD progenitor is on the AGB, and thus the observed orbital period of 359 days requires an efficient common envelope ejection. The rapid rotation of the BL indicates it accreted some material during its evolution, perhaps via a wind prior to the common envelope. This system will likely undergo a second common envelope in the future, and thus could result in a short-period double WD binary or merger of a 0.72 M$_\odot$ C/O WD and a 0.38 $M_\odot$ Helium WD, making this a potential progenitor of an interesting transient such as a sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova.</description>

      <title>How a Klein-Nishina Modified Eddington limited accretion explains rapid black hole growth in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of quasars and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ merely hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang generates tension with the idea of Eddington-limited accretion and pressures the community into exploring the concept of massive black hole seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion. The observation that many black holes have reached supermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion models are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the physics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically thick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides the radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of the inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section drops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite being Eddington-limited. Indeed, after implementing a modified cross-section calculated via the Klein-Nishina Formula, we find that SMBH formation time drops by up to $47\%$. In this context, we show how a $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ black hole can form from a seed $10 M_{\odot}$ black hole within $500$ Myr by way of accretion and mergers. While our picture is over-simplified and contrived in a number of ways that we discuss, we suggest that our scenario is interesting in that it offers a solution to two issues at the intersection of astrophysics and cosmology, namely the reason the Eddington limit is obeyed and how some black holes have grown rapidly despite that limit.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. I. A suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of high-mass star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood. Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations. Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models. Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars.
  Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel and ALMA.
  Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations (RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally, the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included.
  Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the observations,</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Understanding R-Process Nucleosynthesis in Metal-Poor Stars and Stellar Systems</title>

Abstract: The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) is responsible for the creation of roughly half of the elements heavier than iron, including precious metals like silver, gold, and platinum, as well as radioactive elements such as thorium and uranium. Despite its importance, the nature of the astrophysical sites where the r-process occurs, and the detailed mechanisms of its formation, remain elusive. The key to resolving these mysteries lies in the study of chemical signatures preserved in ancient, metal-poor stars. In this review, we explore r-process nucleosynthesis, focusing on the sites, progenitors, and formation mechanisms. We discuss the role of potential astrophysical sites such as neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, that can play a key role in producing the heavy elements. We also highlight the importance of studying these signatures through high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, stellar archaeology, and multi-messenger astronomy. Recent advancements, such as the gravitational wave event GW170817 and detection of the r-process in the ejecta of its associated kilonovae, have established neutron star mergers as one of the confirmed sites. However, questions remain regarding whether they are the only sites that could have contributed in early epochs or if additional sources are needed to explain the signatures of r-process found in the oldest stars. Additionally, there are strong indications pointing towards additional sources of r-process-rich nuclei in the context of Galactic evolutionary timescales. This review summarizes what has been learned so far, the challenges that remain, and the exciting prospects for future discoveries. The increasing synergy between observational facilities, computational models, and large-scale surveys is poised to transform our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Globular cluster formation from inertial inflows: accreting extremely massive stars as the origin of abundance anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, $10^{3-4}\,\msun$) form in massive GCs ($\gtrsim10^5\,\msun$). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates have become comparable to their accretion rates ($\gtrsim10^{-2}\,\msun\,\yr^{-1}$). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation ($\sim 1-2\,\myr$), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars ($\lesssim1\,\msun$) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small ($\Delta Y \simeq 0.01$) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs from gas with surface densities $\gtrsim10^3\,\msun\,\pc^{-2}$ and that nitrogen-rich galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) are dominated by EMS-rich GCs that formed in the earliest phases of galaxy formation. These EMSs may have left behind intermediate-mass black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap ($\gtrsim120\,\msun$) that could be found with ongoing gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>The Resolved Structure of a Low Metallicity Photodissociation Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photodissociation Regions (PDRs) are key to understanding the feedback processes that shape interstellar matter in galaxies. One important type of PDR is the interface between HII regions and molecular clouds, where far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from massive stars heats gas and dissociates molecules. Photochemical models predict that the C/CO transition occurs deeper in the PDR compared to the H/H$_2$ transition in low-metallicity environments, increasing the extent of CO-dark H$_2$ gas. This prediction has been difficult to test outside the Milky Way due to the lack of high spatial resolution observations tracing H$_2$ and CO. This study examines a low-metallicity PDR in the N13 region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) where we spatially resolve the ionization front, the H$_2$ dissociation front, and the C/CO transition using 12CO J=2-1, 3-2 and [CI] (1-0) observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA) and near-infrared spectroscopy of the H$_2$ 2.12 1-0S(1) vibrational line, and H recombination lines from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our analysis shows that the separation between the H/H$_2$ and C/CO boundaries is approximately 0.043 $\pm$ 0.013(stat.) $\pm$ 0.0036(syst.) pc (equivalent to 0".146 $\pm$ 0".042(stat.) $\pm$ 0".012(syst.) at the SMC's distance of 62 kpc), defining the spatial extent of the CO-dark H$_2$ region. Compared to our plane-parallel PDR models, we find that a constant pressure model matches the observed structure better than a constant density one. Overall, we find that the PDR model does well at predicting the extent of the CO-dark H$_2$ layer in N13. This study represents the first resolved benchmark for low metallicity PDRs.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and the associated spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays in dynamical galactic halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed understanding of cosmic-ray transport in galactic halos is essential for explaining various observations, such as the radio continuum measurements of synchrotron radiation from energetic electrons. Of central importance is the spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays, which can be computed in an ab~initio manner if the turbulence in the background medium is known. The study aimed to establish a suitable framework to compute the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and, hence, the diffusion tensor in the dynamical halos of galaxies. The Reynolds-averaged single-fluid MHD equations were solved numerically on a cylindrical grid, assuming axial symmetry and fixed boundary conditions on a central ellipsoid representing the galaxy. The physical properties of both large-scale MHD and small-scale turbulent quantities, including the coefficients of parallel and perpendicular diffusion, were extracted from the resulting steady state. Hydrodynamic validation revealed a persistent instability of the near-axis flow, which could be traced to the galaxy's gravitating mass. The results for the evolution of MHD turbulence in a galactic halo -- using parameters approximating those of NGC4631 -- enabled an ab initio computation of the spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays through the application of a state-of-the-art nonlinear theory. The simulation results reveal variation in turbulence quantities, (i.e., fluctuation energy, correlation scale, and cross helicity) in a dynamical halo. Furthermore, the corresponding diffusion tensor of cosmic rays exhibits significant variation throughout such a halo.</description>

      <title>MOSDEF-3D: Keck/OSIRIS Maps of the Ionized ISM in $z \sim 2$ Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spatially-resolved rest-frame optical emission line maps of four galaxies at $z \sim 2$ observed with Keck/OSIRIS to study the physical conditions of the ISM at Cosmic Noon. Our analysis of strong emission line ratios in these galaxies reveals an offset from the local star-forming locus on the BPT diagram, but agrees with other star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. Despite the offset towards higher [O III]$\lambda5008$/H$\beta$ and [N II]$\lambda6585$/H$\alpha$, these strong-line ratios remain consistent with or below the maximum starburst threshold even in the inner $\sim 1$ kpc region of the galaxies, providing no compelling evidence for central AGN activity. The galaxies also exhibit flat radial gas-phase metallicity gradients, consistent with previous studies of $z \sim 2$ galaxies and suggesting efficient radial mixing possibly driven by strong outflows from intense star formation. Overall, our results reveal the highly star-forming nature of these galaxies, with the potential to launch outflows that flatten metallicity gradients through significant radial gas mixing. Future observations with JWST/NIRSpec are crucial to detect fainter emission lines at higher spatial resolution to further constrain the physical processes and ionization mechanisms that shape the ISM during Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Tomographic analysis of galaxy angular density and redshift fluctuations in Data Release 3. Constraints on photo-$z$ errors, linear bias, and peculiar velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The {\it Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey} (J-PLUS) is a {\it spectro-photometric} survey covering about 3,000~deg$^2$ in its third data release (DR3), and containing about 300,000 galaxies with high quality ({\it odds}$&gt;0.8$) photometric redshifts (hereafter photo-$z$s). We use this galaxy sample to conduct a tomographic study of the counts and redshift angular fluctuations under Gaussian shells sampling the redshift range $z\in[0.05,0.25]$. We confront the angular power spectra of these observables measured under shells centered on 11 different redshifts with theoretical expectations derived from a linear Boltzmann code ({\tt ARFCAMB}). Overall we find that J-PLUS DR3 data are well reproduced by our linear, simplistic model. We obtain that counts (or density) angular fluctuations (hereafter ADF) are very sensitive to the linear galaxy bias $b_g(z)$, although weakly sensitive to radial peculiar velocities of the galaxy field, while suffering from systematics residuals for $z&gt;0.15$. Angular redshift fluctuations (ARF), instead, show higher sensitivity to radial peculiar velocities and also higher sensitivity to the average uncertainty in photo-$z$s ($\sigma_{\rm Err}$), with no obvious impact from systematics. For $z&lt;0.15$ both ADF and ARF agree on measuring a monotonically increasing linear bias varying from $b_g(z=0.05)\simeq 0.9\pm 0.06$ up to $b_g(z=0.15)\simeq 1.5\pm 0.05$, while, by first time, providing consistent measurements of $\sigma_{\rm Err}(z)\sim 0.014$ that are $\sim 40~\%$ higher than estimates from the photo-$z$ code {\tt LePhare}, ($\sigma_{\rm Err}^{\rm LePhare}=0.010$). As expected, this photo-$z$ uncertainty level prevents the detection of radial peculiar velocities in the modest volume sampled by J-PLUS DR3, although prospects for larger galaxy surveys of similar (and higher) photo-$z$ precision are promising.</description>

      <title>Looking into the Jet Cone of the Neutrino-Associated Very High Energy Blazar PKS 1424+240</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The acceleration process of massive particles as well as the production of very high energy (VHE) photons and neutrinos remains a fundamental challenge in astrophysics. We investigate the parsec-scale jet structure and magnetic field of the blazar PKS 1424+240, that has been selected on the basis of strong VHE gamma-ray emission and identified with one of the highest peaks in the IceCube 9-year neutrino sky. We analyze 15 GHz VLBA observations of this BL Lac object, stacking 42 polarization-sensitive images collected in 2009-2025 to enhance the signal and reveal persistent parsec-scale structure. Our observations uncover a rare scenario. The object is viewed inside the jet cone, very close to the axis of its relativistic jet, with a viewing angle of &lt;0.6 deg. This effectively maximizes Doppler boosting to values ~30 and enhances both electromagnetic and neutrino emission in the observer's direction. Based on polarimetric observations, we unambiguously detect a net toroidal component of the jet's magnetic field, indicating a current carrying jet flowing almost directly towards our line of sight. Blazars with very small jet viewing angles offer a solution to the longstanding mismatch between Doppler factors inferred from low VLBI apparent jet speed and those derived from VHE observations -- the so-called "Doppler factor crisis". We show that relativistic beaming plays the critical role in the gamma-ray and neutrino emission of blazars, with direct implications for models of their multi-messenger emission.</description>

      <title>Inferring Dense Confined Circumstellar Medium around Supernova Progenitors via Long-term Hydrodynamical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circumstellar interaction of supernova (SN) ejecta is an essential process in its evolution and observations of SNe have found the signature of circumstellar interaction both in the early and late evolutionary phase of SNe. In this Letter, we show that if the SN forward shock plunges into tenuous stellar wind from dense circumstellar medium (CSM) in the vicinity of the progenitor (i.e., confined CSM), the subsequent time evolutions of the SN-CSM interaction system deviates from the prediction of self-similar solution. In this case, after all of the confined CSM is swept up by the SN forward shock (roughly $10$ days after the explosion), the propagation of the shocked shell will be driven by the freely expanding ram pressure of the confined CSM component, instead of the SN ejecta. Meanwhile, the forward shock decelerates faster than the prediction of thin-shell approximation once the confined CSM component reaches homologous expansion. This lasts until the reverse shock in the confined CSM component reaches the head of the SN ejecta, leading to the restoration of the system into the evolutionary model without confined CSM, where the SN ejecta drives the expansion of the system. We also show that this peculiar evolution will be reflected in observational signatures originating from SN-CSM interaction, taking rapid decline and rebrightening of radio emission as examples. Our results shed light on the importance of taking into account the effect of initial SN-CSM interaction even when we focus on observational properties of SNe a few years after the explosion.</description>
