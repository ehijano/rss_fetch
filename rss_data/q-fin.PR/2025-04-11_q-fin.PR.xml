      <title>Foreign Signal Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new machine learning approach to detect value-relevant foreign information for both domestic and multinational companies. Candidate foreign signals include lagged returns of stock markets and individual stocks across 47 foreign markets. By training over 100,000 models, we capture stock-specific, time-varying relationships between foreign signals and U.S. stock returns. Foreign signals exhibit out-of-sample return predictability for a subset of U.S. stocks across domestic and multinational companies. Valuable foreign signals are not concentrated in those largest foreign markets nor foreign firms in the same industry as U.S. firms. Signal importance analysis reveals the price discovery of foreign information is significantly slower for information from emerging and low-media-coverage markets and among stocks with lower foreign institutional ownership but is accelerated during the COVID-19 crisis. Our study suggests that machine learning-based investment strategies leveraging foreign signals can emerge as important mechanisms to improve the market efficiency of foreign information.</description>

      <title>Trading Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new algorithm -- Trading Graph Neural Network (TGNN) that can structurally estimate the impact of asset features, dealer features and relationship features on asset prices in trading networks. It combines the strength of the traditional simulated method of moments (SMM) and recent machine learning techniques -- Graph Neural Network (GNN). It outperforms existing reduced-form methods with network centrality measures in prediction accuracy. The method can be used on networks with any structure, allowing for heterogeneity among both traders and assets.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Markowitz's (1952) decomposition of a portfolio variance as a quadratic form in the variables of the relative amounts invested into the securities, which has been the core of classical portfolio theory for more than 70 years, is valid only in the approximation when all trade volumes with all securities of the portfolio are assumed constant. We derive the market-based portfolio variance and its decomposition by its securities, which accounts for the impact of random trade volumes and is a polynomial of the 4th degree in the variables of the relative amounts invested into the securities. To do that, we transform the time series of market trades with the securities of the portfolio and obtain the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of market trades determine the market-based means and variances of prices and returns of the portfolio in the same form as the means and variances of any market security. The decomposition of the market-based variance of returns of the portfolio by its securities follows from the structure of the time series of market trades of the portfolio as a single security. The market-based decompositions of the portfolio's variances of prices and returns could help the managers of multi-billion portfolios and the developers of large market and macroeconomic models like BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed adjust their models and forecasts to the reality of random markets.</description>
