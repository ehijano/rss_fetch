      <title>Trap Identification in Molecular Charge Transport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method to identify traps in molecular charge transport networks as obtained by multiscale modeling of organic semiconductors. Depending on the materials, traps can be defect-like single molecules or clusters of several neighboring ones, and can have a significant impact on the dynamics of charge carriers. Our proposed method builds on the random walk model of charge dynamics on a directed, weighted graph, the molecular transport network. It comprises an effective heuristic to determine the number of traps or trap clusters based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the random walk Laplacian matrix and uses subsequent spectral clustering techniques to identify these traps. In contrast to currently available methods, ours enables identification of trap molecules in organic semiconductors without having to explicitly simulate the charge dynamics. As a prototypical system we study an amorphous morphology of bathocuproine, a material with known high energetic disorder and charge trapping. Based on a first-principle multiscale model, we first obtain a reference charge transport network and then modify its properties to represent different trap characteristics. In contrast to currently available methods, our approach successfully identifies both single trap, multiple distributed traps, and a combination of a single-molecule trap and trap regions on an equal footing.</description>

      <title>Organic compounds in metallic hydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic hydrogen is the most common condensed material in the universe, comprising the centre of gas giant planets. However, experimental studies are extremely challenging, and most of our understanding of this material has been led by theory. Chemistry in this environment has not been probed experimentally, so here we examine hydrocarbon chemistry in metallic hydrogen using density functional theory calculations. We find that carbon and oxygen react with metallic hydrogen to produce an entirely new type of hydrocarbon chemistry based on sixfold coordinated carbon with organic-style molecules CH6, C2H8, C3H10 OH3 NH4 and CH4OH. These are charged molecules stabilised by the metallic environment. Their associated electric fields are screened, giving oscillation in the surrounding electron and proton densities. In view of the excess hydrogen we refer to them as hypermethane, hyperethane etc. The relationship to traditional chemistry is that the metallic background acts as an electron donor and stabilizes negatively charged ions. This enables the formation of six covalent bonds per carbon atom, or three per oxygen atom. This demonstrates that organic chemistry may take place in very different environments from those found on earth, and may be common throughout the universe.</description>

      <title>On the convection boundedness of numerical schemes across discontinuities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note introduces a novel diagnostic tool for evaluating the convection boundedness properties of numerical schemes across discontinuities. The proposed method is based on the convection boundedness criterion and the normalised variable diagram. By utilising this tool, we can determine the CFL conditions for numerical schemes to satisfy the convection boundedness criterion, identify the locations of over- and under-shoots, optimize the free parameters in the schemes, and develop strategies to prevent numerical oscillations across the discontinuity. We apply the diagnostic tool to assess representative discontinuity-capturing schemes, including THINC, fifth-order WENO, and fifth-order TENO, and validate the conclusions drawn through numerical tests. We further demonstrate the application of the proposed method by formulating a new THINC scheme with less stringent CFL conditions.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive representation of selection at loci with multiple alleles that allows complex forms of genotypic fitness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic diversity is central to the process of evolution. Both natural selection and random genetic drift are influenced by the level of genetic diversity of a population; selection acts on diversity while drift samples from it. At a given locus in a diploid population, each individual carries only two alleles, but the population as a whole can possess a much larger number of alleles, with the upper limit constrained by twice the population size. This allows for many possible types of homozygotes and heterozygotes. Moreover, there are biologically important loci, for example those related to the MHC complex, the ABO blood types, and cystic fibrosis, that exhibit a large number of alleles. Despite this, much of population genetic theory, and data analysis, are limited to considering biallelic loci. However, to the present, what is lacking is a flexible expression for the force of selection that allows an arbitrary number of alleles (and hence an arbitrary number of heterozygotes), along with a variety of forms of fitness. In this work, we remedy this absence by giving an analytical representation of the force of selection that emphasises the very different roles played by the diversity of the population, and the fitnesses of different genotypes. The result presented facilitates our understanding and applies in a variety of different situations involving multiple alleles. This includes situations where fitnesses are: additive, multiplicative, randomly fluctuating, frequency-dependent, and it allows fitnesses which involve explicit gene interactions, such as heterozygote advantage.</description>

      <title>Multi-Parameter Molecular MRI Quantification using Physics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biophysical model fitting plays a key role in obtaining quantitative parameters from physiological signals and images. However, the model complexity for molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often translates into excessive computation time, which makes clinical use impractical. Here, we present a generic computational approach for solving the parameter extraction inverse problem posed by ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling coupled with experimental measurement of the system dynamics. This is achieved by formulating a numerical ODE solver to function as a step-wise analytical one, thereby making it compatible with automatic differentiation-based optimization. This enables efficient gradient-based model fitting, and provides a new approach to parameter quantification based on self-supervised learning from a single data observation. The neural-network-based train-by-fit pipeline was used to quantify semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) amide proton exchange parameters in the human brain, in an in-vivo molecular MRI study (n=4). The entire pipeline of the first whole brain quantification was completed in 18.3$\pm$8.3 minutes, which is an order-of-magnitude faster than comparable alternatives. Reusing the single-subject-trained network for inference in new subjects took 1.0$\pm$0.2 s, to provide results in agreement with literature values and scan-specific fit results (Pearson's r&gt;0.98, p&lt;0.0001).</description>

      <title>Quantum Calculations of Hydrogen Absorption and Diffusivity in Bulk $\mathrm{CeO_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CeO$_2$ (ceria) is an attractive material for heterogeneous catalysis applications involving hydrogen due to its favorable redox activity combined with its relative impermeability to hydrogen ions and molecules. However, to date, many bulk ceria/hydrogen properties remain unresolved in part due to a scarcity of experimental data combined with quantum calculation results that vary according to the approach used. In this regard, we have conducted a series of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations utilizing generalized gradient (GGA), meta-GGA, and hybrid functionals as well as several corrections for electronic correlations, applied to a number of properties regarding hydrogen in bulk stoichiometic $\mathrm{CeO_2}$. Our calculations place reasonable bounds on the lattice constants, band gaps, hydrogen absorption energies, and O-H bond vibrational frequencies that can be determined by DFT. In addition, our results indicate that the activation energy barriers for hydrogen bulk diffusion are uniformly low ($ &lt; 0.15 \ \mathrm{eV} $) for the calculation parameters probed here and that, in general, the effect of hydrogen tunneling is small at ambient temperatures. Our study provides a recipe to determine fundamental physical chemical properties of Ce-O-H interactions while also determining realistic ranges for diffusion kinetics. This can facilitate the determination of future coarse-grained models that will be able to guide and elucidate experimental efforts in this area.</description>

      <title>A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations: technical details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work applies a reduced basis method to study the continuum physics of a finite quantum system -- either few or many-body. Specifically, we develop reduced-order models, or emulators, for the underlying inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation and train the emulators against the equation's bound-state-like solutions at complex energies. The emulators can quickly and accurately interpolate and extrapolate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian resolvent operator (Green's function) in a parameter space that encompasses the complex energy plane as well as other real-valued parameters in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The spectra, discretized and compressed as the result of emulation, and the associated resolvent matrix elements (or amplitudes), have the defining characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics calculations, featuring complex eigenenergies with negative imaginary parts and resolvent matrix elements with branch cuts moved below the real axis in the complex energy plane. Therefore, we now have a method that extracts continuum physics from bound-state-like calculations and emulates them in the input parameter space. Some significant results have previously been presented in a short report (arXiv:2408.03309). Here, we provide details of the study and an in-depth analysis, including how this method could be coupled with existing approaches to compute and emulate bound and continuum states.</description>

      <title>Timing and Dynamics of the Rosanna Shuffle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rosanna shuffle, the drum pattern from Toto's 1982 hit "Rosanna", is one of the most recognized drum beats in popular music. Recorded by Jeff Porcaro, this drum beat features a half-time shuffle with rapid triplets on the hi-hat and snare drum. In this analysis, we examine the timing and dynamics of the original drum track, focusing on rhythmic variations such as swing factor, microtiming deviations, tempo drift, and the overall dynamics of the hi-hat pattern. Our findings reveal that "Rosanna" exhibits a surprisingly pronounced swing for its genre, along with notable tempo drift typical of tracks recorded without a metronome. Additionally, we observe clear long-range correlations in the microtiming deviations, consistent with previous studies. Notably, the two-bar phrases of the song feature a distinctive repeating pattern in the timing and dynamics of the hi-hat beats, which enhances the song's phrasing. Overall, the Rosanna shuffle boasts a rich array of rhythmic characteristics that solidify its significant place in music history.</description>

      <title>Gate-Controllable Quadri-Layertronics in 2D Multiferroic Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layertronics that manifests layer Hall effect is typically considered to intrinsically possess binary physics. Using symmetry arguments and a low-energy kp model, we show that the layer physics in layertronics can be engineered into quaternary mode, giving rise to the concept of quadri-layertronics. The mechanism correlates to the interplay between out-of-plane ferroelectricity and valley physics in antiferromagnetic multiferroic quadrilayer, which enables the layer-locked Berry curvature and Hall effect, i.e., deflecting the carriers with four different layer physics to move in specific directions. More importantly, the quadri-layertronics can be generated and manipulated by controlling the interlayer dipole arrangements via a gate voltage, allowing for the selective induction and detection of layer Hall effect in specific layers. Using first principles calculations, we further demonstrate the gate control of quadri-layertronics in multiferroic antiferromagnet of quadrilayer OsCl2. These explored phenomena and insights greatly enrich the research on layertronics.</description>

      <title>Slice sampling tensor completion for model order reduction of parametric dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of finding a low-rank approximation of a multi-dimensional tensor, $\Phi $, using a subset of its entries. A distinctive aspect of the tensor completion problem explored here is that entries of the $d$-dimensional tensor $\Phi$ are reconstructed via $C$-dimensional slices, where $C &lt; d - 1$. This setup is motivated by, and applied to, the reduced-order modeling of parametric dynamical systems. In such applications, parametric solutions are often reconstructed from space-time slices through sparse sampling over the parameter domain. To address this non-standard completion problem, we introduce a novel low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then incorporated into a Galerkin reduced order model (ROM), specifically an interpolatory tensor-based ROM. We demonstrate the performance of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Re-anchoring Quantum Monte Carlo with Tensor-Train Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, having a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for avoiding sign problems. Typically, this trial wavefunction is fixed throughout the simulation. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems, achieving a relative error of \(10^{-5}\) in estimating ground-state energies. Additionally, the overlap between our estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction achieves a high-fidelity. We provide a convergence proof, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimate.</description>

      <title>Descriptors-free Collective Variables From Geometric Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling simulations make the computational study of rare events feasible. A large family of such methods crucially depends on the definition of some collective variables (CVs) that could provide a low-dimensional representation of the relevant physics of the process. Recently, many methods have been proposed to semi-automatize the CV design by using machine learning tools to learn the variables directly from the simulation data. However, most methods are based on feed-forward neural networks and require as input some user-defined physical descriptors. Here, we propose to bypass this step using a graph neural network to directly use the atomic coordinates as input for the CV model. This way, we achieve a fully automatic approach to CV determination that provides variables invariant under the relevant symmetries, especially the permutational one. Furthermore, we provide different analysis tools to favor the physical interpretation of the final CV. We prove the robustness of our approach using different methods from the literature for the optimization of the CV, and we prove its efficacy on several systems, including a small peptide, an ion dissociation in explicit solvent, and a simple chemical reaction.</description>

      <title>Waveflow: boundary-conditioned normalizing flows applied to fermionic wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient and expressive wavefunction ansatz is key to scalable solutions for complex many-body electronic structures. While Slater determinants are predominantly used for constructing antisymmetric electronic wavefunction ans\"{a}tze, this construction can result in limited expressiveness when the targeted wavefunction is highly complex. In this work, we introduce Waveflow, an innovative framework for learning many-body fermionic wavefunctions using boundary-conditioned normalizing flows. Instead of relying on Slater determinants, Waveflow imposes antisymmetry by defining the fundamental domain of the wavefunction and applying necessary boundary conditions. A key challenge in using normalizing flows for this purpose is addressing the topological mismatch between the prior and target distributions. We propose using O-spline priors and I-spline bijections to handle this mismatch, which allows for flexibility in the node number of the distribution while automatically maintaining its square-normalization property. We apply Waveflow to a one-dimensional many-electron system, where we variationally minimize the system's energy using variational quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC). Our experiments demonstrate that Waveflow can effectively resolve topological mismatches and faithfully learn the ground-state wavefunction.</description>

      <title>MONKES: a fast neoclassical code for the evaluation of monoenergetic transport coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MONKES is a new neoclassical code for the evaluation of monoenergetic transport coefficients in stellarators. By means of a convergence study and benchmarks with other codes, it is shown that MONKES is accurate and efficient. The combination of spectral discretization in spatial and velocity coordinates with block sparsity allows MONKES to compute monoenergetic coefficients at low collisionality, in a single core, in approximately one minute. MONKES is sufficiently fast to be integrated into stellarator optimization codes for direct optimization of the bootstrap current and to be included in predictive transport suites. The code and data from this paper are available at https://github.com/JavierEscoto/MONKES/</description>

      <title>Particle transport and deposition in wall-sheared thermal turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the transport and deposition behaviour of point particles in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection cells subjected to Couette-type wall shear. Direct numerical simulations (DNSs) are performed for Rayleigh number ($Ra$) in the range $10^7 \leq Ra \leq 10^9$ with a fixed Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$, while the wall-shear Reynolds number ($Re_w$) is in the range $0 \leq Re_w \leq 12000$. With the increase of $Re_w$, the large-scale rolls expanded horizontally, evolving into zonal flow in two-dimensional simulations or streamwise-oriented rolls in three-dimensional simulations. We observed that, for particles with a small Stokes number ($St$), they either circulated within the large-scale rolls when buoyancy dominated or drifted near the walls when shear dominated. For medium $St$ particles, pronounced spatial inhomogeneity and preferential concentration were observed regardless of the prevailing flow state. For large $St$ particles, the turbulent flow structure had a minor influence on the particles' motion; although clustering still occurred, wall shear had a negligible influence compared with that for medium $St$ particles. We then presented the settling curves to quantify the particle deposition ratio on the walls. Our DNS results aligned well with previous theoretical predictions, which state that small $St$ particles settle with an exponential deposition ratio and large $St$ particles settle with a linear deposition ratio. For medium $St$ particles, where complex particle-turbulence interaction emerges, we developed a new model describing the settling process with an initial linear stage followed by a nonlinear stage. Unknown parameters in our model can be determined either by fitting the settling curves or using empirical relations. Compared with DNS results, our model also accurately predicts the average residence time across a wide range of $St$ for various $Re_w$.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of confinement induced effects on atomic electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that although a litany of studies have been published on atoms in hard-wall confinement, they have not been systematic or have not used robust numerical methods. We report a methodical study of atoms in hard-wall confinement employing a robust finite element method (FEM) in HelFEM that guarantees variational results and allows easily finding the numerically exact solution. Our fully numerical calculations are non-relativistic and are carried out at three levels of density functional theory with spherically averaged densities: the PW92, PBE, and r$^2$SCAN functionals. The three are in excellent agreement, confirming the physicality of our results.
  We systematically examine low lying configurations of the H-Xe atoms and their monocations, and investigate how the configurations - especially the ground state - behave as a function of the position of the hard-wall boundary. We consider both spin-polarized as well as spin-restricted densities, and demonstrate that spin-polarization effects are significant in open shell configurations, even though some previous studies have only considered the spin-restricted model.
  We demonstrate the importance of considering ground state changes for confined atoms by computing the ionization radii for the H-Xe atoms and observe significant differences to earlier studies.
  Confirming previous observations, we identify electron shifts on the outermost shells for a majority of the elements: valence $s$ electrons are highly unfavored under strong confinement, and the high-lying $3d$ and $4f$ orbitals become occupied in atoms of periods 2-3 and 3-4, respectively.
  We also comment on deficiencies of a commonly used density based estimate for the van der Waals (vdW) radius of atoms, and propose a better behaved variant in terms of the number of electrons outside the vdW radius that we expect will prove useful in future studies.</description>

      <title>Creation of an Fe$_3$P Schreibersite Density Functional Tight Binding Model for Astrobiological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mineral schreibersite, e.g., Fe$_3$P, is commonly found in iron-rich meteorites and could have served as an abiotic phosphorus source for prebiotic chemistry. However, atomistic calculations of its degradation chemistry generally require quantum simulation approaches, which can be too computationally cumbersome to study sufficient time and length scales for this process. In this regard, we have created a computationally efficient semi-empirical quantum Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) model for iron and phosphorus-containing materials by adopting an existing semi-automated workflow that represents many-body interactions by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. We have utilized a relatively small training set to optimize a DFTB model that is accurate for schreibersite physical and chemical properties, including its bulk properties, surface energies, and water absorption. We then show that our model shows strong transferability to several iron phosphide solids as well as multiple allotropes of iron metal. Our resulting DFTB parameterization will allow us to interrogate schreibersite aqueous decomposition at longer time and length scales than standard quantum approaches, allowing for investigations of its role in prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.</description>

      <title>Deep Ritz -- Finite Element methods: Neural Network Methods trained with Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Rock-Paper-Scissors games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that species interactions often involve long-term memory, with highly-varying waiting times between successive events and long-range temporal correlations. Accounting for memory undermines the common Markovian assumption, and dramatically impacts key ingredients of population dynamics including birth, foraging, predation, and competition processes. Here, we investigate a critical aspect of population dynamics, namely non-Markovian multi-species competition. This is done in the realm of the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model that is broadly used in the life sciences to metaphorically describe cyclic competition between three interacting species. We develop a general non-Markovian formalism for multi-species dynamics, allowing us to determine the regions of the parameter space where each species dominates. In particular, when the dynamics are Markovian, the waiting times are exponentially distributed and the fate of the zRPS model in large well-mixed populations follows the so-called ``law of the weakest'' (LOW), predicting that the species with the lowest growth rate is the most likely to prevail. We demonstrate that the survival behavior and LOW of the zRPS model are critically affected by non-exponential waiting time distributions, and especially, by their coefficient of variation. Our findings provide key insight into the influence of long waiting times on non-Markovian evolutionary processes.</description>

      <title>AMARO: All Heavy-Atom Transferable Neural Network Potentials of Protein Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>gSeaGen code by KM3NeT: an efficient tool to propagate muons simulated with CORSIKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration has tackled a common challenge faced by the astroparticle physics community, namely adapting the experiment-specific simulation software to work with the CORSIKA air shower simulation output. The proposed solution is an extension of the open-source code gSeaGen, allowing for the transport of muons generated by CORSIKA to a detector of any size at an arbitrary depth. The gSeaGen code was not only extended in terms of functionalities but also underwent a thorough redesign of the muon propagation routine, resulting in a more accurate and efficient simulation. This paper presents the capabilities of the new gSeaGen code as well as prospects for further developments.</description>

      <title>Piezovalley effect and magnetovalley coupling in altermagnetic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clarifying the physical origin of valley polarization and exploring promising ferrovalley materials are conducive to the application of valley degrees of freedom in the field of information storage. Here, we explore two novel altermagnetic semiconductors (monolayers Nb2Se2O and Nb2SeTeO) with N\'eel temperature above room temperature based on first-principles calculations. It reveals that uniaxial strain induces valley polarization without spin-orbital coupling (SOC) in altermagnets owing to the piezovalley effect, while uniaxial compressive strain transforms the intrinsic ferrovalley semiconductor into a semimetal, half metal and metal. Moreover, moderate biaxial strain renders Janus monolayer Nb2SeTeO to robust Dirac-like band dispersion. The SOC and intrinsic in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy induce Dirac-like altermagnets to generate apparent valley polarization through magnetovalley coupling. In terms of SOC perturbation, we elucidate the physical mechanism behind in-plane-magnetization induced valley polarization and demonstrate the magnitude of valley polarization is positively correlated with the square of SOC strength and negatively correlated with the bandgap. The present work reveals the physical origin of valley polarization in altermagnets and expands the application of ferrovalley at room temperature in valleytronics.</description>
