      <title>Comparing the Performance of MC/DC's on-GPU Event-based Processing Methods in Multigroup and Continuous-energy Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo / Dynamic Code (MC/DC) is a portable Monte Carlo neutron transport package for rapid numerical methods exploration in heterogeneous and HPC contexts, developed under the auspices of the Center for Exascale Monte Carlo Neutron Transport (CEMeNT). To support execution on GPUs, MC/DC delegates resource and execution management to Harmonize (another CEMeNT software project). In this paper, we describe and compare the performance of the two methods that Harmonize currently provides: a stack-based method and a distributed, asynchronous method. As part of this investigation, we analyze the performance of both methods under the 3D C5G7 k-eigenvalue benchmark problem and a continuous-energy infinite pin cell problem, as run across 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100s. We find that the asynchronous method exhibits stronger early scaling compared to the stack-based method in the 3D C5G7 benchmark. We also found that the asynchronous method exhibits mixed performance relative to the stack-based method in the continuous-energy problem, depending upon tally resolution, particle count, and transport loop decomposition.</description>

      <title>Antenna Q-Factor Topology Optimization with Auxiliary Edge Resistivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel bi-level topology optimization strategy within the method-of-moments paradigm. The proposed approach utilizes an auxiliary variables called edge resistivities related to the Rao-Wilton-Glisson method-of-moments basis functions, for a definition of a fast local optimization algorithm. The local algorithm combines automatic differentiation with adaptive gradient descent. A Bayesian optimization scheme is applied on top of the local algorithm to search for an optimum position of the delta-gap feeding and optimizer hyperparameters. The strength of the algorithm is demonstrated on Q-factor minimization for electrically small antennas. Auxiliary edge resistivity topology optimization outperforms current state-of-the-art topology optimization methods, including density-based approaches and memetic schemes, in terms of convergence. However, due to the nature of gradient descent, careful tuning of the optimizer hyperparameters is required. Furthermore, the proposed method solves the known binarization issue. Two designs that achieved self-resonance and approached the Q-factor lower bound were further assessed in CST Microwave Studio.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Automatic Differentiation Using Symbolic Differential Algebra: Bridging the Gap between Algorithmic and Symbolic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scientific computation, it is often necessary to calculate higher-order derivatives of a function. Currently, two primary methods for higher-order automatic differentiation exist: symbolic differentiation and algorithmic automatic differentiation (AD). Differential Algebra (DA) is a mathematical technique widely used in beam dynamics analysis and simulations of particle accelerators, and it also functions as an algorithmic automatic differentiation method. DA automatically computes the Taylor expansion of a function at a specific point up to a predetermined order and the derivatives can be easily extracted from the coefficients of the expansion. We have developed a Symbolic Differential Algebra (SDA) package that integrates algorithmic differentiation with symbolic computation to produce explicit expressions for higher-order derivatives using the computational techniques of algorithmic differentiation. Our code has been validated against existing DA and AD libraries. Moreover, we demonstrate that SDA not only facilitates the simplification of explicit expressions but also significantly accelerates the calculation of higher-order derivatives, compared to directly using AD.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann Boundary Conditions for Flow, Convection-Diffusion and MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general derivation is proposed for several boundary conditions arisen in the lattice Boltzmann simulations of various physical problems. Pair-wise moment-conservations are proposed to enforce the boundary conditions with given macroscopic quantities, including the velocity and pressure boundary conditions in flow simulations, a given concentration in convection-diffusion (CD) simulations, as well as specified magnetic field components in magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. Additionally, the CD and MHD simulations might involve the Robin boundary condition for surface reactions and a Robin-like boundary condition for thin walls with finite electrical conductivities, respectively, both of which can be written in a form with a variable flux term. In this case, the proposed boundary scheme takes the flux term as an increment to the bounced distribution function and a reference frame transformation is used to obtain a correction term for moving boundaries. Spatial interpolation and extrapolation are used for arbitrary boundary locations between computational grid points. Due to using the same approach in derivations, the derived boundary conditions for different physical processes in a coupled simulation are compatible for arbitrary boundary-to-grid distances (not limited to the popular half-grid boundary layout) and arbitrary moving speeds (not limited to the tangential or normal speed). Simulations using half-grid and full-grid boundary layouts are conducted for demonstrations and validations. Moving boundaries are simulated in hydrodynamic and MHD flows, while static boundaries are used in the CD simulations with surface reactions. The numerical and analytical solutions are in excellent agreement in the studied cases.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network model for the era of large atomistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models, or large atomistic models (LAMs), aim to universally represent the ground-state potential energy surface (PES) of atomistic systems as defined by density functional theory (DFT). The scaling law is pivotal in the development of large models, suggesting that their generalizability in downstream tasks consistently improves with increased model size, expanded training datasets, and larger computational budgets. In this study, we present DPA3, a multi-layer graph neural network founded on line graph series (LiGS), designed explicitly for the era of LAMs. We demonstrate that the generalization error of the DPA3 model adheres to the scaling law. The scalability in the number of model parameters is attained by stacking additional layers within DPA3. Additionally, the model employs a dataset encoding mechanism that decouples the scaling of training data size from the model size within its multi-task training framework. When trained as problem-oriented potential energy models, the DPA3 model exhibits superior accuracy in the majority of benchmark cases, encompassing systems with diverse features, including molecules, bulk materials, surface and cluster catalysis, two-dimensional materials, and battery materials. When trained as a LAM on the OpenLAM-v1 dataset, the DPA-3.1-3M model exhibits state-of-the-art performance in the LAMBench benchmark suit for LAMs, demonstrating lowest overall zero-shot generalization error across 17 downstream tasks from a broad spectrum of research domains. This performance suggests superior accuracy as an out-of-the-box potential model, requiring minimal fine-tuning data for downstream scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Real-Time Analysis of Inelastic Neutron Scattering Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate calculation of phonons and vibrational spectra remains a significant challenge, requiring highly precise evaluations of interatomic forces. Traditional methods based on the quantum description of the electronic structure, while widely used, are computationally expensive and demand substantial expertise. Emerging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) offer a transformative alternative by employing pre-trained neural network surrogates to predict interatomic forces directly from atomic coordinates. This approach dramatically reduces computation time and minimizes the need for technical knowledge. In this paper, we produce a phonon database comprising nearly 5,000 inorganic crystals to benchmark the performance of several leading uMLIPs. We further assess these models in real-world applications by using them to analyze experimental inelastic neutron scattering data collected on a variety of materials. Through detailed comparisons, we identify the strengths and limitations of these uMLIPs, providing insights into their accuracy and suitability for fast calculations of phonons and related properties, as well as for real-time interpretation of neutron scattering spectra. Our findings highlight how the rapid advancement of AI in science is revolutionizing experimental research and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Optical Properties of Biological Structures using Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.</description>

      <title>A Concurrent Multiscale Framework Coupling Direct Simulation Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to couple the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithm with molecular dynamics (MD). The coupling approach generalizes prior coupling methods using a cell-based decision. The approach is supported by a lifting and restricting operator, which translate length and time scales between DSMC and MD. We verify the framework on basic conservation laws, and demonstrate its usability on a hypersonic flow example. Its accuracy gain is discussed in light of conventional DSMC simulations. Advantages and limitations are discussed, and additional use cases are highlighted.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Monte Carlo Statistical Uncertainty on Surrogate-based Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-objective design tasks, the computational cost increases rapidly when high-fidelity simulations are used to evaluate objective functions. Surrogate models help mitigate this cost by approximating the simulation output, simplifying the design process. However, under high uncertainty, surrogate models trained on noisy data can produce inaccurate predictions, as their performance depends heavily on the quality of training data. This study investigates the impact of data uncertainty on two multi-objective design problems modelled using Monte Carlo transport simulations: a neutron moderator and an ion-to-neutron converter. For each, a grid search was performed using five different tally uncertainty levels to generate training data for neural network surrogate models. These models were then optimized using NSGA-III. The recovered Pareto-fronts were analyzed across uncertainty levels, and the impact of training data quality on optimization outcomes was quantified. Average simulation times were also compared to evaluate the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Results show that the influence of simulation uncertainty is strongly problem-dependent. In the neutron moderator case, higher uncertainties led to exaggerated objective sensitivities and distorted Pareto-fronts, reducing normalized hypervolume. In contrast, the ion-to-neutron converter task was less affected--low-fidelity simulations produced results similar to those from high-fidelity data. These findings suggest that a fixed-fidelity approach is not optimal. Surrogate models can still recover the Pareto-front under noisy conditions, and multi-fidelity studies can help identify the appropriate uncertainty level for each problem, enabling better trade-offs between computational efficiency and optimization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Toward Knowledge-Guided AI for Inverse Design in Manufacturing: A Perspective on Domain, Physics, and Human-AI Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping inverse design across manufacturing domain, enabling high-performance discovery in materials, products, and processes. However, purely data-driven approaches often struggle in realistic settings characterized by sparse data, high-dimensional design spaces, and nontrivial physical constraints. This perspective argues for a new generation of design systems that transcend black-box modeling by integrating domain knowledge, physics-informed learning, and intuitive human-AI interfaces. We first demonstrate how expert-guided sampling strategies enhance data efficiency and model generalization. Next, we discuss how physics-informed machine learning enables physically consistent modeling in data-scarce regimes. Finally, we explore how large language models emerge as interactive design agents connecting user intent with simulation tools, optimization pipelines, and collaborative workflows. Through illustrative examples and conceptual frameworks, we advocate that inverse design in manufacturing should evolve into a unified ecosystem, where domain knowledge, physical priors, and adaptive reasoning collectively enable scalable, interpretable, and accessible AI-driven design systems.</description>

      <title>DiffPINN: Generative diffusion-initialized physics-informed neural networks for accelerating seismic wavefield representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful framework for seismic wavefield modeling, yet they typically require time-consuming retraining when applied to different velocity models. Moreover, their training can suffer from slow convergence due to the complexity of of the wavefield solution. To address these challenges, we introduce a latent diffusion-based strategy for rapid and effective PINN initialization. First, we train multiple PINNs to represent frequency-domain scattered wavefields for various velocity models, then flatten each trained network's parameters into a one-dimensional vector, creating a comprehensive parameter dataset. Next, we employ an autoencoder to learn latent representations of these parameter vectors, capturing essential patterns across diverse PINN's parameters. We then train a conditional diffusion model to store the distribution of these latent vectors, with the corresponding velocity models serving as conditions. Once trained, this diffusion model can generate latent vectors corresponding to new velocity models, which are subsequently decoded by the autoencoder into complete PINN parameters. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly accelerates training and maintains high accuracy across in-distribution and out-of-distribution velocity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction techniques for inverse Sturm-Liouville problems with complex coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is considered, including the two-spectrum inverse problem, the problem of recovering the potential from the Weyl function, as well as the recovery from the spectral function. In all cases the potential in the Sturm-Liouville equation is assumed to be complex valued. A unified approach for the approximate solution of the inverse Sturm-Liouville problems is developed, based on Neumann series of Bessel functions (NSBF) representations for solutions and their derivatives. Unlike most existing approaches, it allows one to recover not only the complex-valued potential but also the boundary conditions of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Efficient accuracy control is implemented. The numerical method is direct. It involves only solving linear systems of algebraic equations for the coefficients of the NSBF representations, while eventually the knowledge only of the first NSBF coefficients leads to the recovery of the Sturm-Liouville problem. Numerical efficiency is illustrated by several test examples.</description>

      <title>Observation of pseudogap in Cr_{1-x}Y_xN magnetic alloy and its impact on the Seebeck coefficient by ab-initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials require high electronic conductivity and low thermal conductivity. CrN has been shown to have low phononic thermal conductivity, making it a potential candidate for thermoelectric applications. In addition, similarities have been observed between YN and ScN suggesting that the CrYN alloy may have interesting thermoelectric properties. As CrYN has not been studied in detail at the level of thermoelectric properties, the first study on CrYN alloy of Seebeck coefficient and zT figure of merit is proposed in this study. For this purpose, cubic special quasirandom structures were constructed at values of x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 in the alloy Cr_{1-x}Y_xN starting from different magnetic structures. After analyzing lattice parameters, Cr magnetic moments, octahedron deformation, second neighbors distribution around metals, density of states and band structures, it was concluded that to obtain high values of Seebeck coefficient and zT, it is necessary the presence of a pseudo gap in both spin channels and it is also necessary that the Fermi level is on a steep decreasing slope of number of states, since due to Motts approximation, the value of this slope is proportional to the Seebeck coefficient. Density of states of all the structures shows a metallic behavior. In structures with x=0.5, the presence of small indirect energy gaps is observed. Although no structure retains the initial magnetic configuration, there is a possible influence of this on the electronic structure. Considerable deformations in octahedra can suppress thermoelectric properties.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.</description>

      <title>The Bloch Equation Generator -- SimuF\'isica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between multilevel quantum systems and coherent radiation underlies several phenomena in modern atomic optics. The formulation and solution of the Bloch equations, which describe the dynamics of such systems, become complex as the number of levels increases. In this work, we present the Bloch Equation Generator, a free, browser-based computational tool developed to automate the generation and numerical solution of Bloch equations for systems with up to 30 levels. Users can configure the level diagram, select allowed transitions, define decay rates, and choose whether or not to apply the rotating wave approximation. The software automatically generates the complete set of equations and provides C source code for numerical solutions in both the time and frequency domains. To illustrate its applicability, we present three examples: (i) a two-level system, (ii) a $\Lambda$-type system with analysis of CPT, EIT, and the Autler-Townes effect, and (iii) a realistic 12-level system based on the Zeeman-resolved $5S_{1/2} \to 5P_{3/2}$ transition of rubidium-87.</description>

      <title>Direct determination of layer anomalous Hall conductivity using uniaxial Wannier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for computing layer anomalous Hall conductivity (LAHC) in real space by integrating the Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki method with hybrid Wannier functions localized along a single axis. To validate the method, we calculated the LAHC of axion-insulating MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and confirmed the agreement between the sum of LAHC on the surface and the surface AHC previously reported. We further applied the method to antiferromagnetic Mn$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$ and examined the dependence on the magnetic structure of LAHC, identifying cases with and without axion insulating behavior. This layer-resolved analysis offers a powerful tool for studying topological transport in complex materials, including heterostructures, and may guide the design of future devices based on the anomalous Hall effect with precise layer control.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Embedding via Ghost Gutzwiller Approximation for Enhanced Simulations of Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating correlated materials on present-day quantum hardware remains challenging due to limited quantum resources. Quantum embedding methods offer a promising route by reducing computational complexity through the mapping of bulk systems onto effective impurity models, allowing more feasible simulations on pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. This work develops a quantum-classical embedding framework based on the ghost Gutzwiller approximation to enable quantum-enhanced simulations of ground-state properties and spectral functions of correlated electron systems. Circuit complexity is analyzed using an adaptive variational quantum algorithm on a statevector simulator, applied to the infinite-dimensional Hubbard model with increasing ghost mode numbers from 3 to 5, resulting in circuit depths growing from 16 to 104. Noise effects are examined using a realistic error model, revealing significant impact on the spectral weight of the Hubbard bands. To mitigate these effects, the Iceberg quantum error detection code is employed, achieving up to 40% error reduction in simulations. Finally, the accuracy of the density matrix estimation is benchmarked on IBM and Quantinuum quantum hardware, featuring distinct qubit-connectivity and employing multiple levels of error mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>Adsorbate phase transitions on nanoclusters from nested sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nested sampling was employed to investigate adsorption equilibria on the truncated-octahedral Lennard-Jones nanocluster LJ$_{38}$ while systematically varying adsorbate-surface well depth and Lennard-Jones size parameters. Evaluation of the canonical partition function over a wide temperature range identifies two successive phase transitions: (i) condensation of the gas phase onto the cluster surface at higher temperatures, and (ii) lateral rearrangement of the adsorbed layer at lower temperatures. For identical interactions, the condensate first populates both three- and four-fold hollow sites; when adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are weakened, preference shifts to the four-coordinated (100) sites. Size mismatch governs low-temperature behavior: smaller adsorbates aggregate to increase mutual contacts, whereas larger ones distribute more evenly to maximize coordination with the cluster. These findings highlight key trends in facet competition and lattice mismatch, and showcase nested sampling as an automated, unbiased tool for exploring surface configurational space and guiding investigations of more complex, realistic interfaces.</description>

      <title>A flexible and interoperable high-performance Lanczos-based solver for generic quantum impurity problems: upgrading EDIpack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EDIpack is a flexible, high-performance numerical library using Lanczos-based exact diagonalization to solve generic quantum impurity problems, such as those introduced in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to describe extended strongly correlated materials. The library efficiently solves impurity problems allowing for different broken-symmetry solutions, including superconductivity and featuring local spin-orbit coupling and/or electron-phonon coupling. The modular architecture of the software not only provides Fortran APIs but also includes bindings to C/C++, interfaces with Python and Julia or with TRIQS and W2Dynamics research platforms, thus ensuring unprecedented level of inter-operability. The outlook includes further extensions to study quantum materials and cold atoms quantum simulators, as well as quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>PMNO: A novel physics guided multi-step neural operator predictor for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators, which aim to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, have been widely applied in the simulation and prediction of physical systems. However, the limited representational capacity of network architectures, combined with their heavy reliance on large-scale data, often hinder effective training and result in poor extrapolation performance. In this paper, inspired by traditional numerical methods, we propose a novel physics guided multi-step neural operator (PMNO) architecture to address these challenges in long-horizon prediction of complex physical systems. Distinct from general operator learning methods, the PMNO framework replaces the single-step input with multi-step historical data in the forward pass and introduces an implicit time-stepping scheme based on the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) during backpropagation. This design not only strengthens the model's extrapolation capacity but also facilitates more efficient and stable training with fewer data samples, especially for long-term predictions. Meanwhile, a causal training strategy is employed to circumvent the need for multi-stage training and to ensure efficient end-to-end optimization. The neural operator architecture possesses resolution-invariant properties, enabling the trained model to perform fast extrapolation on arbitrary spatial resolutions. We demonstrate the superior predictive performance of PMNO predictor across a diverse range of physical systems, including 2D linear system, modeling over irregular domain, complex-valued wave dynamics, and reaction-diffusion processes. Depending on the specific problem setting, various neural operator architectures, including FNO, DeepONet, and their variants, can be seamlessly integrated into the PMNO framework.</description>

      <title>Electronic Temperature-Driven Phase Stability and Structural Evolution of Iron at High Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Gibbs free-energy phase diagrams for compressed iron within a pressure range of 20 to 300 GPa and electronic temperature up to 3 eV obtained using finite-temperature density functional and density functional perturbation theories. Our results for bcc, fcc, and hcp phases predict solid-solid phase transitions in iron driven purely by electronic entropy and temperature. We found a phase transition from hcp to bcc at pressures above 200 GPa, which depends on the electronic temperature. An experimental observation of the stability of the bcc phase above 200 GPa by X-ray Free Electron Laser has recently been reported.</description>

      <title>Consensus-based adaptive sampling and approximation for high-dimensional energy landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a consensus-based framework that unifies phase space exploration with posterior-residual-based adaptive sampling for surrogate construction in high-dimensional energy landscapes. Unlike standard approximation tasks where sampling points can be freely queried, physical systems with complex energy landscapes such as molecular dynamics (MD) do not have direct access to arbitrary sampling regions due to the physical constraints and energy barriers; the surrogate construction further relies on the dynamical exploration of phase space, posing a significant numerical challenge. We formulate the problem as a minimax optimization that jointly adapts both the surrogate approximation and residual-enhanced sampling. The construction of free energy surfaces (FESs) for high-dimensional collective variables (CVs) of MD systems is used as a motivating example to illustrate the essential idea. Specifically, the maximization step establishes a stochastic interacting particle system to impose adaptive sampling through both exploitation of a Laplace approximation of the max-residual region and exploration of uncharted phase space via temperature control. The minimization step updates the FES surrogate with the new sample set. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the present approach for biomolecular systems with up to 30 CVs. While we focus on the FES construction, the developed framework is general for efficient surrogate construction for complex systems with high-dimensional energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>The Monte Carlo Computational Summit -- October 25 &amp; 26, 2023 -- Notre Dame, Indiana, USA</title>

Abstract: The Monte Carlo Computational Summit was held on the campus of the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, USA on 25--26 October 2023. The goals of the summit were to discuss algorithmic and software alterations required for successfully porting respective code bases to exascale-class computing hardware, compare software engineering techniques used by various code teams, and consider the adoption of industry-standard benchmark problems to better facilitate code-to-code performance comparisons. A large portion of the meeting included candid discussions of direct experiences with approaches that have and have not worked. Participants reported that identifying and implementing suitable Monte Carlo algorithms for GPUs continues to be a sticking point. They also report significant difficulty porting existing algorithms between GPU APIs (specifically Nvidia CUDA to AMD ROCm). To better compare code-to-code performance, participants decided to design a C5G7-like benchmark problem with a defined figure of merit, with the expectation of adding more benchmarks in the future. Problem specifications and results will eventually be hosted in a public repository and will be open to submissions by all Monte Carlo transport codes capable of running the benchmark problem. The participants also identified the need to explore the intermediate and long-term future of the Monte Carlo neutron transport community and how best to modernize and contextualize Monte Carlo as a useful tool in modern industry. Overall the summit was considered to be a success by the organizers and participants, and the group shared a strong desire for future, potentially larger, Monte Carlo summits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Hotspice, a Monte Carlo simulation software designed to capture the dynamics and equilibrium states of Artificial Spin Ice (ASI) systems with both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) geometries. An Ising-like model is used where each nanomagnet is represented as a macrospin, with switching events driven by thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic interactions, and external fields. To improve simulation accuracy, we explore the impact of several corrections to this model, concerning for example the calculation of the dipole interaction in IP and OOP ASI, as well as the impact of allowing asymmetric rather than symmetric energy barriers between stable states. We validate these enhancements by comparing simulation results with experimental data for pinwheel and kagome ASI lattices, demonstrating how these corrections enable a more accurate simulation of the behavior of these systems. We finish with a demonstration of 'clocking' in pinwheel and OOP square ASI as an example of reservoir computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a tensor network simulation of a neutral atom quantum system under the presence of noise, while introducing a new purity-preserving truncation technique that compromises between the simplicity of the matrix product state and the positivity of the matrix product density operator. We apply this simulation to a near-optimized iteration of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a transverse field Ising model in order to investigate the influence of large system sizes on the performance of the algorithm. We find that while circuits with a large number of qubits fail more often under noise that depletes the qubit population, their outputs on a successful measurement are just as robust under Rydberg atom dissipation or qubit dephasing as smaller systems. However, such circuits might not perform as well under coherent multi-qubit errors such as Rydberg atom crosstalk. We also find that the optimized parameters are especially robust to noise, suggesting that a noisier quantum system can be used to find the optimal parameters before switching to a cleaner system for measurements of observables.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under XFEL illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) captures the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The ultrashort pulse produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) 'outruns' much of the radiation damage that impairs conventional crystallography. However, the rapid onset of 'electronic damage' due to ionization limits this benefit. Here, we distinguish the influence of different atomic species on the ionization of protein crystals by employing a plasma code that tracks the unbound electrons as a continuous energy distribution. The simulations show that trace quantities of heavy atoms (Z &gt; 10) contribute a substantial proportion of global radiation damage by rapidly seeding electron ionization cascades. In a typical protein crystal, sulfur atoms and solvated salts induce a substantial fraction of light-atom ionization. In further modeling of various targets, global ionization peaks at photon energies roughly 2 keV above inner-shell absorption edges, as sub-2 keV photoelectrons ejected from these shells initiate ionization cascades that are briefer than the XFEL pulse. These results indicate that relatively small quantities of heavy elements can substantially affect global radiation damage in XFEL experiments.</description>

      <title>On the characteristic structure of the adjoint Euler equations and the analytic adjoint solution of supersonic inviscid flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characteristic structure of the two-dimensional adjoint Euler equations is examined. The behavior is similar to that of the original Euler equations, but with the information travelling in the opposite direction. The compatibility conditions obeyed by the adjoint variables along characteristic lines are derived. It is also shown that adjoint variables can have discontinuities across characteristics and the corresponding jump conditions are obtained. It is shown how this information can be used to obtain exact predictions for the adjoint variables, particularly for supersonic flows. The approach is illustrated by the analysis of supersonic flow past a double wedge airfoil, for which an analytic adjoint solution is obtained in the near-wall region. The solution is zero downstream of the airfoil and piecewise constant around it except across the expansion fan, where the adjoint variables change smoothly while remaining constant along each Mach wave within the fan.</description>

Abstract: Most AI-for-Materials research to date has focused on ideal crystals, whereas real-world materials inevitably contain defects that play a critical role in modern functional technologies. The defects break geometric symmetry and increase interaction complexity, posing particular challenges for traditional ML models. Here, we introduce Defect-Informed Equivariant Graph Neural Network (DefiNet), a model specifically designed to accurately capture defect-related interactions and geometric configurations in point-defect structures. DefiNet achieves near-DFT-level structural predictions in milliseconds using a single GPU. To validate its accuracy, we perform DFT relaxations using DefiNet-predicted structures as initial configurations and measure the residual ionic steps. For most defect structures, regardless of defect complexity or system size, only 3 ionic steps are required to reach the DFT-level ground state. Finally, comparisons with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images confirm DefiNet's scalability and extrapolation beyond point defects, positioning it as a valuable tool for defect-focused materials research.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian learning has emerged as a compelling and vital research direction in the field of structural dynamics, offering a probabilistic lens to understand and refine the analysis of complex dynamical systems. This review meticulously traces the three-decade evolution of Bayesian learning in structural dynamics, illuminating core principles, groundbreaking methodologies, and diverse applications that have significantly influenced the field. The narrative commences by delving into the basics of Bayesian theory, clarifying essential concepts, and introducing primary methods for deriving posterior distributions, with an in-depth exploration of three types: Laplace approximation, stochastic sampling, and variational inference. Subsequently, the text explores the implementation of two types of Bayesian learning in structural dynamics: physical model learning and data-centric statistical model learning. Physical model learning emphasizes inferring physical model parameters within a Bayesian framework for system identification and prediction, while statistical model learning integrates Bayesian learning methodologies into data-centric statistical modeling within probabilistic machine learning. Both types resonate across various applications, such as modal analysis, model updating, damage detection, and reliability updating, highlighting their pivotal role in enhancing comprehension of dynamical systems and decision-making. The paper also navigates obstacles by proposing ways to enhance existing Bayesian inference strategies. Distinguished from previous research, this study offers a thorough examination of both traditional and cutting-edge Bayesian methods. It not only underscores the transformative influence of Bayesian approaches but also serves as a beacon, guiding researchers in the judicious selection and refinement of suitable methods for various challenges in structural dynamics.</description>
