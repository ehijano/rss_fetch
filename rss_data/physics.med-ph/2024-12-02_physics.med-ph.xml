      <title>Multi-Task Learning for Integrated Automated Contouring and Voxel-Based Dose Prediction in Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based automated contouring and treatment planning has been proven to improve the efficiency and accuracy of radiotherapy. However, conventional radiotherapy treatment planning process has the automated contouring and treatment planning as separate tasks. Moreover in deep learning (DL), the contouring and dose prediction tasks for automated treatment planning are done independently. In this study, we applied the multi-task learning (MTL) approach in order to seamlessly integrate automated contouring and voxel-based dose prediction tasks, as MTL can leverage common information between the two tasks and be able able to increase the efficiency of the automated tasks. We developed our MTL framework using the two datasets: in-house prostate cancer dataset and the publicly available head and neck cancer dataset, OpenKBP. Compared to the sequential DL contouring and treatment planning tasks, our proposed method using MTL improved the mean absolute difference of dose volume histogram metrics of prostate and head and neck sites by 19.82% and 16.33%, respectively. Our MTL model for automated contouring and dose prediction tasks demonstrated enhanced dose prediction performance while maintaining or sometimes even improving the contouring accuracy. Compared to the baseline automated contouring model with the dice score coefficients of 0.818 for prostate and 0.674 for head and neck datasets, our MTL approach achieved average scores of 0.824 and 0.716 for these datasets, respectively. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed automated contouring and planning using MTL to support the development of efficient and accurate automated treatment planning for radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Influencing Factors of the FLASH Effect: Unveiling the Importance of Free Radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Our aim was to elucidate the critical factors responsible for inducing the FLASH effect, focusing on the role of free radicals through simulation and experimental approaches. Methods and Materials: The whole abdomen of C57BL/6 mice was irradiated with 6 MeV electron beam. The endpoint was acute intestinal toxicity quantified by histological score. Total doses ranging from 6 to 15 Gy were evaluated. The impact of the mean dose rate (MDR) was assessed in the range of 40 to 900 Gy/s. Dose per pulse (DPP) of 0.5 Gy and 3 Gy were compared. The recombination of peroxyl radicals were simulated. Further comparisons were conducted by incorporating the antioxidant amifostine. Results: When varying total doses with a constant MDR of 900 Gy/s, the FLASH effect was not observed until the dose reached 15 Gy. For a total dose of 15 Gy and varying MDR, the FLASH effect was observed only when MDR reached 100 Gy/s. For a dose of 15 Gy and an MDR of 150 Gy/s, no significant difference in biological effect was observed between low DPP and high DPP. The simulation results indicated that the fraction of peroxyl radicals recombination remained nearly zero at conventional dose rates. For FLASH irradiation, the recombination fraction increased linearly with the dose. Notably, the dose delivery time corresponding to 50% change in the recombination fraction was approximately 300 ms. The addition of amifostine effectively eliminated the difference between FLASH group and CONV group. Conclusions: The critical requirement for observing the sparing effect at the biological endpoint is the administration of an adequate dose within the time window of the radical reaction. Additionally, the important role of free radical was verified after introducing antioxidants, suggesting that the generation and recombination of free radicals are pivotal factors influencing the FLASH sparing effect.</description>

      <title>Artifact Correction in Magnetic Resonance Temperature Imaging for Laser Interstitial Thermotherapy with Multi-echo Acquisitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In MRI-guided laser interstitial thermotherapy (MRgLITT), a signal void sometimes appears at the heating center of the measured temperature map. In neurosurgical MRgLITT treatments, cerebrospinal fluid pulsation (CSF), which may lead to temperature artifacts, also needs to be carefully managed. We find that signal loss in MR magnitude images can be one distinct contributor to the temperature imaging signal void. Therefore, this study aims to investigate this finding and more importantly. Also, this study intends to improve measurement accuracy by correcting CSF-induced temperature errors and employing a more reliable phase unwrapping algorithm. A gradient echo sequence with certain TE values for temperature imaging is used to quantify T2* variations during MRgLITT and to investigate the development of signal voids throughout the treatment. Informed by these findings, a multi-echo GRE sequence with appropriate TE coverage is employed. A multi-echo-based correction algorithm is developed to address the signal loss-induced temperature errors. A new phase unwrapping method and a new CSF pulsation correction approach are developed for multi-echo signal processing. The temperature imaging method is evaluated by gel phantom, ex-vivo, and in-vivo LITT heating experiments. T2* shortening during heating can be one important cause of the temperate imaging signal voids and this demands the multi-echo acquisition with varied TE values. The proposed multi-echo-based method can effectively correct signal loss-induced temperature errors and raise temperature estimation precision. The multi-echo thermometry in the in-vivo experiments shows smoother hotspot boundaries, fewer artifacts, and improved thermometry reliability. In the in-vivo experiments, the ablation areas estimated from the multi-echo thermometry also show satisfactory agreement with those determined from post-ablation MR imaging.</description>

      <title>MRI Breast tissue segmentation using nnU-Net for biomechanical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating 2D mammography with 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for improving breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. However, this integration is challenging due to differences in imaging modalities and the need for precise tissue segmentation and alignment. This paper addresses these challenges by enhancing biomechanical breast models in two main aspects: improving tissue identification using nnU-Net segmentation models and evaluating finite element (FE) biomechanical solvers, specifically comparing NiftySim and FEBio. We performed a detailed six-class segmentation of breast MRI data using the nnU-Net architecture, achieving Dice Coefficients of 0.94 for fat, 0.88 for glandular tissue, and 0.87 for pectoral muscle. The overall foreground segmentation reached a mean Dice Coefficient of 0.83 through an ensemble of 2D and 3D U-Net configurations, providing a solid foundation for 3D reconstruction and biomechanical modeling. The segmented data was then used to generate detailed 3D meshes and develop biomechanical models using NiftySim and FEBio, which simulate breast tissue's physical behaviors under compression. Our results include a comparison between NiftySim and FEBio, providing insights into the accuracy and reliability of these simulations in studying breast tissue responses under compression. The findings of this study have the potential to improve the integration of 2D and 3D imaging modalities, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for breast cancer.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Calculating the characteristics of radiation emerging from radiation shielding to determine the level of safety in protected areas has been a widely studied topic in Radiation Protection due to its importance for the protection of the public and professionals. Methods: This work provides spatial distributions of energy spectra of emergent photons after shielding barriers. These distributions are obtained through Monte Carlo simulations using monoenergetic pencil photon beams incident on shielding barriers of different materials and thicknesses. The obtained results are applied to calculate the spectra of transmitted radiation in cases of polyenergetic beams similar to those encountered in clinical practice. Results: The significant contribution of secondary radiation in the radiation found behind shields is demonstrated across a wide range of energies, barrier thicknesses and barrier materials. Conclusion: It is shown that characterizing shields using their response to monoenergetic pencil beams provides a useful tool for characterizing radiation behind shields in a wide range of practical situations.</description>

      <title>Integrating audiological datasets via federated merging of Auditory Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audiological datasets contain valuable knowledge about hearing loss in patients, which can be uncovered using data-driven, federated learning techniques. Our previous approach summarized patient information from one audiological dataset into distinct Auditory Profiles (APs). To obtain a better estimate of the audiological patient population, however, patient patterns must be analyzed across multiple, separated datasets, and finally, be integrated into a combined set of APs.
  This study aimed at extending the existing profile generation pipeline with an AP merging step, enabling the combination of APs from different datasets based on their similarity across audiological measures. The 13 previously generated APs (NA=595) were merged with 31 newly generated APs from a second dataset (NB=1272) using a similarity score derived from the overlapping densities of common features across the two datasets. To ensure clinical applicability, random forest models were created for various scenarios, encompassing different combinations of audiological measures.
  A new set with 13 combined APs is proposed, providing separable profiles, which still capture detailed patient information from various test outcome combinations. The classification performance across these profiles is satisfactory. The best performance was achieved using a combination of loudness scaling, audiogram and speech test information, while single measures performed worst.
  The enhanced profile generation pipeline demonstrates the feasibility of combining APs across datasets, which should generalize to all datasets and could lead to an interpretable global profile set in the future. The classification models maintain clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Overview of the Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for Magnetic Resonance Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided radiation therapy (RT) is enhancing head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment through superior soft tissue contrast and longitudinal imaging capabilities. However, manual tumor segmentation remains a significant challenge, spurring interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automation. To accelerate innovation in this field, we present the Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for MR-Guided Applications (HNTS-MRG) 2024 Challenge, a satellite event of the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention. This challenge addresses the scarcity of large, publicly available AI-ready adaptive RT datasets in HNC and explores the potential of incorporating multi-timepoint data to enhance RT auto-segmentation performance. Participants tackled two HNC segmentation tasks: automatic delineation of primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) and gross metastatic regional lymph nodes (GTVn) on pre-RT (Task 1) and mid-RT (Task 2) T2-weighted scans. The challenge provided 150 HNC cases for training and 50 for testing, hosted on Grand Challenge using a Docker submission framework. In total, 19 independent teams from across the world qualified by submitting both their algorithms and corresponding papers, resulting in 18 submissions for Task 1 and 15 submissions for Task 2. Evaluation using the mean aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient showed top-performing AI methods achieved scores of 0.825 in Task 1 and 0.733 in Task 2. These results surpassed clinician interobserver variability benchmarks, marking significant strides in automated tumor segmentation for MR-guided RT applications in HNC.</description>
