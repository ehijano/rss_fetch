      <title>Virtual Braids and Cluster Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2015 Hikami and Inoue constructed a representation of the braid group in terms of cluster algebra associated with the decomposition of the complement of the corresponding knot into ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra. This representation leads to the calculation of the hyperbolic volume of the complement of the knot that is the closure of the corresponding braid. In this paper, based on the Hikami-Inoue representation discussed above, we construct a representation for the virtual braid group. We show that the so-called "forbidden relations" do not hold in the image of the resulting representation. In addition, based on the developed method, we construct representations for the flat braid group and the flat virtual braid group.</description>

      <title>On 2-complexes embeddable in 4-space, and the excluded minors of their underlying graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the potentially undecidable problem of whether a given 2-dimensional CW complex can be embedded into $\mathbb{R}^4$. We provide operations that preserve embeddability, including joining and cloning of 2-cells, as well as $\Delta\mathrm Y$-transformations. We also construct a CW complex for which $\mathrm Y\Delta$-transformations do not preserve embeddability.
  We use these results to study 4-flat graphs, i.e., graphs that embed in $\mathbb{R}^4$ after attaching any number of 2-cells to their cycles; a graph class that naturally generalizes planarity and linklessness. We verify several conjectures of van der Holst; in particular, we prove that each of the 78 graphs of the Heawood family is an excluded minor for the class of 4-flat graphs.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic and satellite Lorenz links obtained by twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Lorenz link is equivalent to a T-link, which is a positive braid built by concatenating torus braids of increasing size. When each torus braid except the largest is obtained by full twists, then the T-link can be described as the Dehn filling of a parent link. In this paper, we completely classify when such parent links are hyperbolic. This gives a classification of the geometry of T-links obtained by full twists when the amount of twisting is large, although the bound on the number of required twists is not effective. We also present effective results on hyperbolicity for two families of T-links obtained by twisting, even when the number of twists is small. Finally, we identify families of satellite T-links obtained by half-twists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every orientable infinite type surface without boundary and finite genus has a Riemann surface structure such that its modular group of quasiconformal homeomorphisms is countable.</description>
