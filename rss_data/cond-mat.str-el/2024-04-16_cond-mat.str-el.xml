      <title>Nano-welding of quantum spin-$1/2$ chains at minimal dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of switching on a coupling term between two quantum many-body systems. Specifically, we (i) quantify the energetic cost of establishing a weak junction between two quantum spin-$1/2$ chains in finite time $\tau$ and (ii) identify the energetically optimal protocol to realize it. For linear driving protocols, we find that for long times the excess (irreversible) work scales as $\tau^{-\eta}$, where $\eta=1, 2$ or a nonuniversal number depending on the phase of the chains. Interestingly, increasing a $J_z$ anisotropy in the chains suppresses the excess work thus promoting quasi-adiabaticity. The general optimal control problem is solved, employing a Chebyshev ansatz. We find that the optimal control protocol is intimately sensitive to the chain phases.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane-Shastry (HS) chain. It has a simple realisation via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley-Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like for the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Realization of nodal ring semimetal in pressurized black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are intriguing targets for exploring unconventional physical properties of massless fermions. Among them, nodal line or nodal ring semimetals have attracted attention for their unique one-dimensional band contact in momentum space and resulting nontrivial quantum phenomena. By field angular resolved magnetotransport measurements and theoretical calculations, we show that pressurized black phosphorus (BP) is an ideal nodal ring semimetal with weak spin-orbit coupling, which has a sole and carrier density-tunable nodal ring isolated from other trivial bands. We also revealed that the large magnetoresistance effect and its field-angular dependence in semimetallic BP are due to highly anisotropic relaxation time. Our results establish pressurized BP as an elemental model material for exploring nontrivial quantum properties unique to the topological nodal ring.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of strain-induced ferromagnetism in LaCoO$_3$ thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using spectroscopic ellipsometry, we studied the optical conductivity of LaCoO$_3$ with various degrees of strain. The optical response of the compressively strained \lco\ film is qualitatively similar to the one of the unstrained LaCoO$_3$ polycrystalline sample and exhibits redistribution of the spectral weight between about 0.2 and 6 eV, which is most likely related to the thermal excitation of the high-spin states. The optical response of the ferromagnetic tensile strained film exhibits clear signatures due to the ferromagnetic state. Below the Curie temperature $T_c=82$ K, the spectral weight is transferred with the increasing temperature from low energies between 0.2 and 3.3 eV to energies between 3.3 and 5.6 eV. The temperature dependence of the low-energy spectral weight between 0.2 and 3.3 eV can be understood in the framework of the high-spin biexciton model of Sotnikov and Kune\v{s} as corresponding to the variation of the concentration of high-spin states that are stabilized below $T_c$. The magnitude of redistribution of spectral weight due to the formation of the ferromagnetic state is sizable. We estimate that it corresponds to a lowering of the kinetic energy of 13 meV per Co ion, which is about two times $k_BT_c$. The latter shows that the saving of the kinetic energy is important and may be the leading energy contribution in the formation of the ferromagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetic and quadrupolar H-T phase diagram of CeRh2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy fermion compound CeRh2As2 has intriguing low temperature symmetry breaking phases whose nature is unclear. The unconventional superconducting phase is complemented by other normal state phases which presumably involve ordering of 4f electron multipoles supported by the Kramers doublets split by the tetragonal CEF. The most striking aspect is the pronounced anisotropic H-T phase boundary for in- and out-of plane field direction. Using a localised 4f CEF model we demonstrate that its essential features can be understood as the result of competing low field easy-plane magnetic order and field-induced quadrupolar order of xy type. We present calculations based on coupled multipole RPA response function approach as well as molecular field treatment in the ordered regime. We use an analytical approach for a reduced quasi-quartet model and numerical calculations for the complete CEF level scheme. We discuss the quantum critical properties as function of multipolar control parameters and explain the origin of a pronounced a-c anisotropy of the H-T phase diagram. Finally the field and temperature evolution of multipolar order parameters is derived and the high field phase diagram is predicted.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition and critical behavior between the gapless topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase transition between gapped topological phases represents a class of unconventional criticality beyond the Landau paradigm. However, recent research has shifted attention to topological phases without a bulk gap, where the phase transitions between them are still elusive. In this work, based on large-scale density matrix renormalization group techniques, we investigate the critical behaviors of the extended quantum XXZ model obtained by the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation. Using fidelity susceptibility as a diagnostic, we obtain a complete phase diagram, which includes both topological nontrivial and trivial gapless phases. Furthermore, as the XXZ-type anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ varies, both the critical points $h_c$ and correlation length exponent $\nu$ remain the same as in the $\Delta=0$ case, characterized by $c=3/2$ (Ising + free boson) conformal field theory. Our results indicate that fidelity susceptibility can effectively detect and reveal a stable unconventional critical line between the topologically distinct gapless phases for general $\Delta$. This work serves as a valuable reference for further research on phase transitions within the gapless topological phase of matter.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of Subsystem Symmetries in Exotic and Foliated $BF$ Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mixed 't Hooft anomaly of the subsystem symmetries in the exotic $BF$ theory and the foliated $BF$ theory in 2+1 dimensions, both of which are fractonic quantum field theories describing the equivalent physics. In the anomaly inflow mechanism, the 't Hooft anomaly of the subsystem symmetries can be cancelled by combining a subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phase in one dimension higher. In this work, we construct the exotic and foliated $BF$ theories with background gauge fields and the exotic and foliated forms of the SSPT phases using the foliated-exotic duality. In the foliated form, we see that the non-topological operator can be viewed as a symmetry-like operator. We also show that the SSPT phases with different foliation structures cancel the same anomaly. This may provide a clue to the characterization of the 't Hooft anomaly of subsystem symmetries.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ model on a frustrated zigzag chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum spin-1/2 zigzag chain with frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg interactions, incorporating additional off-diagonal exchange interactions known as the $\Gamma$-term, both with and without an applied magnetic field. Based on the density-matrix renormalization group calculation, we map out the ground state phase diagram that shows a variety of magnetic and nonmagnetic phases including multicritical points and several exactly solvable points. Upon introducing a finite $\Gamma$-term, we observe the persistent dimer singlet state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, sustaining a nonzero spin gap, while also giving rise to a new gapless branch of nonmagnetic excitation. This gapless mode induces robust nematic fluctuations manifesting in its long-ranged correlations, however, the true condensation does not occur until the $\Gamma$-term becomes comparable with the Heisenberg term. There, the nonmagnetic phases transform into Ising-type ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic long-range orders that arise from the $\Gamma$-term spontaneously selecting magnetic easy axes. Its orientations dictate the type of magnetic order under geometric frustration effects as predicted by Landau's mean-field theory. These theoretical findings provide insights into the exotic low-temperature phase observed in YbCuS$_2$, characterized by gapless excitations and seemingly nonmagnetic behavior accompanied by incommensurate correlations.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Cooper-pair density modulation state</title>

Abstract: Superconducting states that break space-group symmetries of the underlying crystal can exhibit nontrivial spatial modulation of the order parameter. Previously, such remarkable states were intimately associated with the breaking of translational symmetry, giving rise to the density-wave orders, with wavelengths spanning several unit cells. However, a related basic concept has been long overlooked: when only intra-unit-cell symmetries of the space group are broken, the superconducting states can display a distinct type of nontrivial modulation preserving long-range lattice translation. Here, we refer to this new concept as the pair density modulation (PDM), and report the first observation of a PDM state in exfoliated thin flakes of iron-based superconductor FeTe$_{\text{0.55}}$Se$_{\text{0.45}}$. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we discover robust superconducting gap modulation with the wavelength corresponding to the lattice periodicity and the amplitude exceeding 30% of the gap average. Importantly, we find that the observed modulation originates from the large difference in superconducting gaps on the two nominally equivalent iron sublattices. The experimental findings, backed up by model calculations, suggest that in contrast to the density-wave orders, the PDM state is driven by the interplay of sublattice symmetry breaking and a peculiar nematic distortion specific to the thin flakes. Our results establish new frontiers for exploring the intertwined orders in strong-correlated electronic systems and open a new chapter for iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Holographic Renormalization Group and Stress Tensor Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic duality conjectures a relation between strongly coupled quantum systems and quantum gravity in higher-dimensional spacetimes. Gravitational theories in two and three dimensions are meaningful examples for classical and quantum exploration due to their unique characteristics, notably the absence of propagating bulk degrees of freedom and the presence of only boundary degrees of freedom, distinguishing them from higher-dimensional counterparts. These gravitational theories exhibit complex interactions when the bulk spacetime has a finite size, regulated by Zamolodchikov's double-trace irrelevant $T\overline{T}$ operator.
  This thesis aims to gain a holographic understanding of $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and JT gravity under the influence of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation. Under a finite radial cutoff, these theories exhibit perturbative behavior that implies the emergence of the Nambu-Goto action for the corresponding boundary graviton action. We also conducted semi-classical calculations of observables related to finite-cutoff gravity and its dual $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT description, including correlation functions involving stress tensors and gravitational Wilson lines, along with an analysis of their supersymmetric extensions. Additionally, we explored the implications of general stress tensor deformations within field-theoretic and holographic settings.
  This thesis integrates previously adapted publications while also pioneering new ground, notably exploring the definition of a quantum $T\overline{T}$ operator beyond two dimensions with $\frac{1}{N}$ corrections, investigating quantum-corrected higher point correlators for a planar boundary, and offering insights into a two-dimensional spherical boundary at a finite cutoff. Furthermore, throughout the thesis, we show more details in calculations at various points.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in aperiodically driven classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven classical many-body systems can host a rich zoo of prethermal dynamical phases. In this work, we extend the paradigm of classical prethermalization to aperiodically driven systems. We establish the existence of a long-lived prethermal regime in spin systems subjected to random multipolar drives (RMDs). We demonstrate that the thermalization time scales as $(1/T)^{2n+2}$, where $n$ is the multipolar order and $T$ is the intrinsic time-scale associated with the drive. In the $n \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the drive becomes quasi-periodic and the thermalization time becomes exponentially long ($\sim \exp(\beta/T)$). We further establish the robustness of prethermalization by demonstrating that these thermalization time scaling laws hold for a wide range of initial state energy densities. Intriguingly, the thermalization process in these classical systems is parametrically slower than their quantum counterparts, thereby highlighting important differences between classical and quantum prethermalization. Finally, we propose a protocol to harness this classical prethermalization to realize time rondeau crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stark systems in which a linear gradient field is applied across a many-body system have recently been harnessed for quantum sensing. Here, we explore sensing capacity of Stark models, in both single-particle and many-body interacting systems, for estimating the strength of both linear and nonlinear Stark fields. The problem naturally lies in the context of multi-parameter estimation. We determine the phase diagram of the system in terms of both linear and nonlinear gradient fields showing how the extended phase turns into a localized one as the Stark fields increase. We also characterize the properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, through a comprehesive finite-size scaling analysis. Interestingly, our results show that the estimation of both the linear and the nonlinear fields can achieve super-Heisenberg scaling. In fact, the scaling exponent of the sensing precision is directly proportional to the nonlinearity exponent which shows that nonlinearity enhances the estimation precision. Finally, we show that even after considering the cost of the preparation time the sensing precision still reveals super-Heisenberg scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the classification of the gap in a holographic setup by studying the density of states. A gap can be classified into order gap and Mott gap depending on the presence of the order due to the symmetry breaking or not. A Mott insulating gap appears in the fermion spectrum due to the strong Coulomb interaction between the electrons. We then classify all Mott gaps as well as order gaps in one-flavor and two-flavor fermions. We also identified possible non-minimal interactions that may produce a flatband.</description>

Abstract: We show how the stability conditions for a system of interacting fermions that conventionally involve variations of thermodynamic potentials can be rewritten in terms of local one- and two-particle correlators. We illustrate the applicability of this alternative formulation in a multi-orbital model of strongly correlated electrons at finite temperatures, inspecting the lowest eigenvalues of the generalized local charge susceptibility in proximity of the phase-separation region. Additionally to the conventional unstable branches, we address unstable solutions possessing a positive, rather than negative compressibility. Our stability conditions require no derivative of free energy functions with conceptual and practical advantages for actual calculations and offer a clear-cut criterion for analyzing the thermodynamics of correlated complex systems.</description>

Abstract: The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels. We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to converge for these configurations.</description>

      <title>Accessing Excitation Spectrum of Many-body Systems via Single-Mode Approximation within Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the Single Mode Approximation (SMA) into quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to provides an efficient and fast method to obtain the dynamical dispersion of quantum many-body systems. Based on Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) and its projector algorithms, The SMA + SSE method can simply extract the dispersion of the dynamical spectrum in the long wave-length limit and the upper bound of the dispersion elsewhere, without external calculations and high technique barriers. Meanwhile, numerical analytic continuation methods require the fine data of imaginary time correlations and complex programming. Therefore, our method can approach the excitation dispersion of large systems, e.g., we take the two-dimensional Heisenberg model on a $512 \times 512$ square lattice. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method with high precision via additional examples. We also demonstrate that SMA combined with SSE goes beyond spin-wave theory with numerical results.</description>

Abstract: Lindbladian formalism, as tuned to dissipative and open systems, has been all-pervasive to interpret non-equilibrium steady states of quantum many-body systems. We study the fate of free fermionic and superconducting phases in a dissipative one-dimensional Kitaev model - where the bath acts both as a source and a sink of fermionic particles with different coupling rates. As a function of these two couplings, we investigate the steady state, its entanglement content, and its approach from varying initial states. Interestingly, we find that the steady state phase diagram retains decipherable signatures of ground state critical physics. We also show that early-time fidelity is a useful marker to find a subclass of phase transitions in such situations. Moreover, we show that the survival of critical signatures at late-times, strongly depend on the thermal nature of the steady state. This connection hints at a correspondence between quantum observables and classical magnetism in the steady state of such systems. Our work uncovers interesting connections between dissipative quantum many-body systems, thermalization of a classical spin and many-body quantum critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Realization of Wess-Zumino-Witten transitions with levels $k=6$ and $k=4$ in a frustrated spin-3 chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dimerization transitions in a frustrated spin-3 chain with next-nearest neighbor and three-site interactions. We show that two independent coupling constants of the model are sufficient to fine-tune the system to the critical point in the Wess-Zumino-Witten SU(2)$_6$ universality class. This critical point appears as the end point of an extended SU(2)$_4$ critical line. This implies that the renormalization group flow lead to the critical theory with the largest level $k$ such that the number of relevant operators is reduced by one and the parity of the level is preserved. Furthermore, we argue that due to the presence of marginal operator there is only one point in the SU(2)$_6$ universality class. In addition, we report the appearance of non-magnetic Ising transition between the topologically trivial uniform and dimerized phases. This transition takes place within the singlet sector, while magnetic gap remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases and, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the spiral spin liquid and surrounding phases in the square lattice XY model</title>

Abstract: Spiral spin liquids possess a subextensively degenerate ground-state manifold, represented by a continuum of energy minima in reciprocal space. Since a small change of the spiral state wavevector requires a global change of the spin configuration in real space, it is a priori unclear how such systems can fluctuate within the degenerate ground state manifold. Only recently it was proposed that momentum vortices are responsible for the liquidity of the spiral phase and that these systems are closely related to an emergent rank-2 U(1) gauge theory [H. Yan and J. Reuther, Phys. Rev. Research 4, 023175 (2022)]. As a consequence of this gauge structure, four-fold pinch-point singularities were found in a generalized spin correlator. In this article, we use classical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics calculations to embed the previously studied spiral spin liquid into a broader phase diagram of the square lattice XY model. We find a multitude of unusual phases and phase transitions surrounding the spiral spin liquid such as an effective four-state Potts transition into a colinear double-striped phase resulting from the spontaneous breaking of two coupled $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. Since this phase is stabilized by entropic effects selecting the momenta away from the spiral manifold, it undergoes a re-entrance phenomenon at low temperatures into a nematic spiral phase. We also observe a region of parameters where the phase transition into the spiral spin liquid does not break any symmetries and where the critical exponents do not match those of standard universality classes. We study the importance of momentum vortices in driving this phase transition and discuss the possibility of a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of momentum vortices. Finally, we explore the regime where the rank-2 U(1) gauge theory is valid by investigating the four-fold pinch point singularities across the phase diagram</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories via deterministic duality transformations assisted by measurements</title>

Abstract: Quantum simulation is one of the major applications of quantum devices. In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, however, the general quantum simulation is not yet feasible, such as that of lattice gauge theories, which is likely limited due to the violation of the Gauss law constraint and the complexity of the real-time dynamics, especially in the deconfined phase. Inspired by the recent works of S. Ashkenazi and E. Zohar [Phys. Rev. A 105, 022431 (2022)] and of N. Tantivasadakarn, R. Thorngren, A. Vishwanath, and R. Verresen [arXiv: 2112.01519], we propose to simulate dynamics of lattice gauge theories by using the Kramers-Wannier transfomation via cluster-state-like entanglers, mid-circuit measurements and feedforwarded corrections, which altogether is a constant-depth deterministic operation. In our scheme, specifically, we first quantum simulate the time evolution under a corresponding symmetric Hamiltonian from an initial symmetric state, and then apply the Kramers-Wannier procedure. This results in a wave function that has time evolved under the corresponding lattice gauge theory from a corresponding initial, gauged wave function. In the presence of noises in time evolution, the procedure succeeds when we can pair up magnetic monopoles represented by non-trivial measurement outcomes. Further, given a noise-free Kramers-Wannier transformation, the resulting wave function from a noisy time evolution satisfies the Gauss law constraint. We give explicit examples with the low dimensional pure gauge theories and gauge theories coupled to bosonic/fermionic matters such as the Fradkin-Shenker model.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits</title>

Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the overall runtime of our method has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. The numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry by leveraging perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: The study of geometrically frustrated many-body quantum systems is of central importance to uncover novel quantum mechanical effects. We design a scheme where ultracold bosons trapped in a one-dimensional state-dependent optical lattice are modeled by a frustrated Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. A derivation of the Hamiltonian parameters based on Cesium atoms, further show large tunability of contact and nearest-neighbour interactions. For pure contact repulsion, we discover the presence of two phases peculiar to frustrated quantum magnets: the bond-order-wave insulator with broken inversion symmetry and a chiral superfluid. When the nearest-neighbour repulsion becomes sizeable, a further density-wave insulator with broken translational symmetry can appear. We show that the phase transition between the two spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases is continuous, thus representing a one-dimensional deconfined quantum critical point not captured by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm. Our results provide a solid ground to unveil the novel quantum physics induced by the interplay of non-local interactions, geometrical frustration, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: In interacting theories, hydrodynamics describes the universal behavior of states close to local thermal equilibrium at late times and long distances in a gradient expansion. In the hydrodynamic regime of metals, momentum relaxes slowly with a rate $\Gamma$, which formally appears on the right-hand side of the momentum dynamical equation and causes a Drude-like peak in the frequency dependence of the thermoelectric conductivities. Here we study the structure and determine the physical implications of momentum-relaxing gradient corrections beyond Drude, \emph{i.e.} arising at subleading order in the gradient expansion. We find that they effectively renormalize the weight of the Drude pole in the thermoelectric conductivities, and contribute to the dc conductivities at the same order as previously-known gradient corrections of translation-invariant hydrodynamics. Turning on a magnetic field, extra derivative corrections appear and renormalize the cyclotron frequency and the Hall conductivity. This relaxed hydrodynamics provides a field-theoretic explanation for previous results obtained using gauge-gravity duality. In strongly-coupled metals where quasiparticles are short-lived and which may be close to a hydrodynamic regime, the extra contributions we discuss are essential to interpret experimentally measured magneto-thermoelectric conductivities. Specializing to metals close to a Fermi liquid phase, the effective mass measured either through the specific heat or the spectral weight of the Drude-like peak are found to differ, as was indeed reported in overdoped cuprate superconductors. More generally, we expect such terms to be present in any hydrodynamic theory with approximate symmetries, which arise in many physical systems.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for studying dynamics in QFT: it provides selection rules, constrains RG flows, and often simplifies analysis. Currently, our understanding is that the most general form of symmetry is described by categorical symmetries which can be realized via Symmetry TQFTs or ``SymTFTs." In this paper, we show how the framework of the SymTFT, which is understood for discrete symmetries (i.e. finite categorical symmetries), can be generalized to continuous symmetries. In addition to demonstrating how $U(1)$ global symmetries can be incorporated into the paradigm of the SymTFT, we apply our formalism to study cubic $U(1)$ anomalies in $4d$ QFTs, describe the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ non-invertible chiral symmetry in $4d$ theories, and conjecture the SymTFT for general continuous $G^{(0)}$ global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Subspace restricted thermalization in a correlated-hopping model with strong Hilbert space fragmentation characterized by irreducible strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions in which a particle can hop between two neighboring sites only if the sites to the left and right of those two sites have different particle numbers. Using a bond-to-site mapping, this model involving four-site terms can be mapped to an assisted pair-flipping model involving only three-site terms. This model shows strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). We define irreducible strings (IS) to label the different fragments, determine the number of fragments, and the sizes of fragments corresponding to some special IS. In some classes of fragments, the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized completely, and in others it can be seen to have a structure characteristic of models which are not fully integrable. In the largest fragment in our model, the number of states grows exponentially with the system size, but the ratio of this number to the total Hilbert space size tends to zero exponentially in the thermodynamic limit. Within this fragment, we provide numerical evidence that only a weak version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) remains valid; we call this subspace-restricted ETH. To understand the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the model, we study the infinite-temperature time-dependent autocorrelation functions starting from a random initial state; we find that these exhibit a different behavior near the boundary compared to the bulk. Finally we propose an experimental setup to realize our correlated-hopping model.</description>

      <title>Krylov localization as a probe for ergodicity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose the inverse localization length on the Krylov chain as a probe to detect weak ergodicity-breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a collapse across different system sizes at the point of weak ergodicity-breaking leading to a quantitative prediction. We further show universal traits of different operators in the ergodic regime beyond the scrambling dynamics. We test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on the Krylov chain.</description>
