      <title>An $O(N)$ Algorithm for Solving the Smallest Enclosing Sphere Problem in the Presence of Degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient algorithms for solving the Smallest Enclosing Sphere (SES) problem, such as Welzl's algorithm, often fail to handle degenerate subsets of points in 3D space. Degeneracies and ill-posed configurations present significant challenges, leading to failures in convergence, inaccuracies or increased computational cost in such cases. Existing improvements to these algorithms, while addressing some of these issues, are either computationally expensive or only partially effective. In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm designed to mitigate degeneracy while maintaining an overall computational complexity of $O(N)$. By combining robust preprocessing steps with efficient core computations, our approach avoids the pitfalls of degeneracy without sacrificing scalability. The proposed method is validated through theoretical analysis and experimental results, demonstrating its efficacy in addressing degenerate configurations and achieving high efficiency in practice.</description>

      <title>The maximum number of digons formed by pairwise crossing pseudocircles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1972, Branko Gr\"unbaum conjectured that any arrangement of $n&gt;2$ pairwise crossing pseudocircles in the plane can have at most $2n-2$ digons (regions enclosed by exactly two pseudoarcs), with the bound being tight. While this conjecture has been confirmed for cylindrical arrangements of pseudocircles and more recently for geometric circles, we extend these results to any simple arrangement of pairwise intersecting pseudocircles. Using techniques from the above-mentioned special cases, we provide a complete proof of Gr\"unbaum's conjecture that has stood open for over five decades.</description>

      <title>Dependable Spanners via Unreliable Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and let $\varepsilon,\psi \in (0,1)$ be parameters. Here, we consider the task of constructing a $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner for $P$, where every edge might fail (independently) with probability $1-\psi$. For example, for $\psi=0.1$, about $90\%$ of the edges of the graph fail. Nevertheless, we show how to construct a spanner that survives such a catastrophe with near linear number of edges.
  The measure of reliability of the graph constructed is how many pairs of vertices lose $(1+\varepsilon)$-connectivity. Surprisingly, despite the spanner constructed being of near linear size, the number of failed pairs is close to the number of failed pairs if the underlying graph was a clique.
  Specifically, we show how to construct such an exact dependable spanner in one dimension of size $O(\tfrac{n}{\psi} \log n)$, which is optimal. Next, we build an $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners for a set $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points, of size $O( C n \log n )$, where $C \approx 1/\bigl(\varepsilon^{d} \psi^{4/3}\bigr)$. Surprisingly, these new spanners also have the property that almost all pairs of vertices have a $\leq 4$-hop paths between them realizing this short path.</description>
