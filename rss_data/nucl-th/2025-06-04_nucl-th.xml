      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based wavefunction ansatz as viable representations for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Through systematic analysis of one-dimensional model systems, we evaluate their computational efficiency and representational power against established methods. Our numerical experiments suggest some efficient training methods and we explore how the computational cost scales with desired precision, particle number, and system parameters. Roughly speaking, KANs seem to be 10 times cheaper computationally than other neural network based ansatz. We also introduce a novel approach for handling strong short-range potentials-a persistent challenge for many numerical techniques-which generalizes efficiently to higher-dimensional, physically relevant systems with short-ranged strong potentials common in atomic and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>New level density parameter beyond Egidy-Bucurescu's systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending beyond the Egidy-Bucurescu systematics, the nuclear level density parameters (LDPs) for the back-shifted Fermi gas model were compiled. Three forms of LDPs were fitted: the liquid-drop model (LDM), the droplet model (DM), and the power-law dependence on mass number A. Additionally, the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the new LDPs and existing literature values were calculated. The newly fitted global LDM-type parameters outperform the commonly used Toke-Swiatecki parameters in various statistical model calculations. In contrast, neither the global nor the combined DM-type parameters yielded satisfactory results. Among the tested parameter sets, the widely adopted Reisdorf parameters exhibited the best overall performance, as evidenced by the larger number of experimental data points falling within their narrower RMSD confidence intervals. For the power-law A-dependence, the new global parameters performed better than the existing homogeneous ones. The ground-state deformation and isospin correction factors had minimal overall impact on the LDP fits. However, the current results suggest that theoretical calculations for transitional nuclei should account for ground-state deformation effects.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of the radii of oxygen isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an {\em ab initio} study of the charge and matter radii of oxygen isotopes from $^{16}$O to $^{20}$O using nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) with high-fidelity N$^3$LO chiral interactions. To efficiently address the Monte Carlo sign problem encountered in nuclear radius calculations, we introduce the {\em partial pinhole algorithm}, significantly reducing statistical uncertainties and extending the reach to more neutron-rich and proton-rich isotopes. Our computed charge radii for $^{16}$O, $^{17}$O, and $^{18}$O closely match experimental data, and we predict a charge radius of $2.810(32)$ fm for $^{20}$O. The calculated matter radii show excellent agreement with values extracted from low-energy proton and electron elastic scattering data, but are inconsistent with those derived from interaction cross sections and charge-changing cross section measurements. These discrepancies highlight model-dependent ambiguities in the experimental extraction methods of matter radii and underscore the value of precise theoretical benchmarks from NLEFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Deformed magic numbers at $N=$178 and $Z=$120, 124 in the 112 $\leq N \leq $ 190 superheavy region from Skyrme mean-field calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Various motivations for exploration of superheavy region revolve around the question on whether 126 is a spherical proton magic number, as is the case for neutrons. In exploring this region, identification of nuclei with relatively longer half-life as compared to its neighbours is crucial for experimental studies. Such information is provided from theoretical predictions, which are however, heavily dependent on the theoretical model used and observable quantities under investigation.
  Purpose: Limiting ourselves to the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-plus-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach, we aimed to analyse the appearance of a nuclear region with relatively high stability associated with emergence of spherical and deformed magic numbers in the region of $170 \le N \le 190$ ($112 \le Z \le 130$) based on various observables.
  Methods: Three Skyrme parametrizations namely the SkM* frequently employed for fission calculations, and the SLy5 and SLy4 commonly used for superheavy region, are considered to provide comparisons within the Skyrme mean-field approach. We evaluated the variation of electric quadrupole deformation ($\beta_{20}$), binding energy per nucleon ($BE/A$), two-nucleon separation energy differential ($\delta S2_{q}$), alpha-decay energy ($Q_{\alpha}$) and alpha-decay half-lives ($T_{1/2}$).
  Conclusion: Our analyses suggest that neutron number $N = 178$ is candidate for deformed magic number around proton number $114 \le Z \le 118$. For protons, $Z = 120$ and $124$ appears to be a candidate for deformed magic number at around $N = 172 \sim 178$. Both sets of deformed magic numbers appear at oblate ground-state deformation.</description>

      <title>Testing Variational Perturbation Theory for Effective Actions Using the Gaudin-Yang Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The background field formalism based on effective actions is a compelling framework for developing an effective field theory for nuclear density functional theory. Among the challenges in carrying out this development is handling both the particle-hole and pairing channels beyond the mean-field level, which includes how to incorporate collective degrees of freedom. Here we use the exactly solvable one-dimensional Gaudin-Yang model as a theoretical laboratory to explore candidate approaches. We compare Variational Perturbation Theory (VPT) to ordinary many-body perturbation theory and the inversion method, all to second order in their respective expansions, and verify issues with Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. VPT outperforms the other approaches at this level over a wide range of densities. The next steps to extend this approach toward nuclei are outlined.</description>

      <title>High-order anisotropic flow and nonlinear hydrodynamic responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ (up to $n = 12$) using high-statistics event-by-event simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ and $5.36$~TeV, employing the IP-Glasma + MUSIC + UrQMD hybrid approach. The power spectra of anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n\{2\}$ vs. $n$) are compared with the ALICE measurements from central to 50% centrality. To understand the various sources contributing to the high-order $v_n$ coefficients, we analyze the nonlinear mode coefficients for high-order anisotropic flow coefficients using different approximations and make comparisons with available measurements.</description>

      <title>A Complete Survey from the $\texttt{CompactObject}$ Perspective on Equation of State Cross-Comparison Using Observational and Nuclear Experimental Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This extensive survey seeks to analyze and contrast different phenomenological methods used to model the nuclear equation of state (EOS) for neutron star matter based on covariant energy density functionals (CEDF). Using two complementary methodologies, we seek to capture a comprehensive picture of the potential behaviors of ultra-dense nucleonic matter and identify the most plausible models based on current observational and experimental constraints. Observational data from radio pulsar timing, gravitational wave detection of GW170817, and X-ray timing provide critical benchmarks for testing the models. We have derived the EOS posteriors for various CEDF models within the $\texttt{CompactObject}$ package, utilizing recent observational data on neutron stars, state-of-the-art theoretical constraints from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) calculations for pure neutron matter at low densities, and pQCD-derived constraints at approximately $7 \times 0.16$ $ \mathrm{fm}^{-3}$. Our analysis has demonstrated that while all considered CEDF models broadly reproduce current astrophysical and theoretical constraints, subtle yet important differences persist among them, with each framework exhibiting distinct characteristics at supra-nuclear density. This is in particular true for the proton fraction inside neutron stars, but also supported by the models' behavior with respect to the pure neutron matter EOS and the density dependence of the speed of sound. Our study highlights the sensitivity of dense matter predictions to the underlying EOS parameterizations and the priors considered.</description>

      <title>Investigating the inclusive $D^0$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral $PbPb$ collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inclusive $D^0$ photoproduction in $PbPb$ collisions at the center - of - mass energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is investigated considering the color dipole $S$ - matrix approach. The analytical expressions for the differential distributions are derived in the impact parameter and transverse momentum spaces and predictions for the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are presented considering three distinct models for the unintegrated gluon distribution of the nuclear target. In particular, we compare the predictions derived assuming a linear dynamics, with and without the inclusion of nuclear effects, with those obtained by solving the running coupling Balitsky - Kovchegov equation. A comparison of these predictions with the recent (preliminary) CMS data is also performed. Our results indicate that a detailed analysis of this observable will be very useful to improve our understanding of the strong interaction theory at high energies and in a nuclear medium.</description>

      <title>Euclidean-Monte-Carlo-informed ground-state preparation for quantum simulation of scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer great potential for investigating dynamical properties of quantum field theories. However, preparing accurate non-trivial initial states for these simulations is challenging. Classical Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods provide a wealth of information about states of interest to quantum simulations. Thus, it is desirable to facilitate state preparation on quantum simulators using this information. To this end, we present a fully classical pipeline for generating efficient quantum circuits for preparing the ground state of an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1 dimensions. The first element of this pipeline is a variational ansatz family based on the stellar hierarchy for bosonic quantum systems. The second element of this pipeline is the classical moment-optimization procedure that augments the standard variational energy minimization by penalizing deviations in selected sets of ground-state correlation functions (i.e., moments). The values of ground-state moments are sourced from classical Euclidean methods. The resulting states yield comparable ground-state energy estimates but exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. The third element of this pipeline is translating the moment-optimized ansatz into an efficient quantum circuit with an asymptotic cost that is polynomial in system size. This work opens the way to systematically applying classically obtained knowledge of states to prepare accurate initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature.</description>

      <title>The Non-perturbative term for the Vector Form Factor of Pion Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vector form factor of the decay $\pi^{+} \rightarrow \gamma + e^{+} + \nu_e$ is calculated by the method for the pseudovector pion-nucleon system. The non-perturbative term is taken into account by using the parameter for the self-energy of nucleon following our previous calculation of the pion form factor. The suppression of the anomalous interaction of proton in the loop integral is significant to understand the experimental value.</description>

      <title>The Study of Pole Trajectory within a bare state in the coupled channel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two-particle scattering and two-particle scattering with a bare basis state using Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory (HEFT). We analyze the distribution of two-body scattering poles in the momentum and energy planes under relativistic conditions. Compared to the non-relativistic case, there are significant differences in the distribution of bound state poles and resonance poles in the relativistic case, primarily due to the square root term in the relativistic formula. By considering pure two-particle scattering, we examine the relationship between the form factor and the number of poles. Additionally, we clearly elucidate the effects of attractive and repulsive interactions on the bound state poles and resonance poles. More importantly, we extend our model by including a bare state and explore the poles originating from the bare state or coupled channels through the trajectories of pole positions, as well as the compositeness of bound states.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the three-flavor quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of the two- and three-flavor quark-meson diquark (QMD) model as a renormalizable low-energy effective model for color superconductivity in dense QCD. The effective degrees of freedom are scalars, pseudo-scalars, diquarks, and quarks. The parameters in the scalar/pseudo-scalar sector can be determined by matching the meson pole masses and decay constants to their observed values using the on-shell renormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are in the diquark sector and a priori unknown. In principle, they can be calculated from QCD, but we consider them free. We renormalize the thermodynamic potential in the 2SC phase for two flavors and in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase for three flavors, determining the counterterms of the couplings in the diquark sector. We derive a set of renormalization group equations for these couplings that are used to improve the thermodynamic potential. As an application, we calculate the gap and the speed of sound in the ideal CFL phase. It is shown that the gap approaches a constant as $\mu_B\rightarrow\infty$ and that the speed of sound relaxes to the conformal limit from above.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of charge-changing cross section and interaction cross section for Be, B, C, N, O, and F isotopes on $^{12}$C at 200-1050 MeV/nucleon</title>

Abstract: To establish credibility for the use of the Slater determinant harmonic oscillator (SDHO) density in predicting root-mean-square proton and neutron radii for Be, B, C, N, O, and F isotopes [M. Imran et al., {\color{blue}Phys. Rev. C {\bf 110}, 014623 (2024)}], in this work we propose to study charge-changing and interaction cross sections for the said isotopes on $^{12}$C at a wider range of incident energies (200-1050 MeV/nucleon), involving different density distributions; the calculations also assess the importance of nuclear medium effects. Working within the framework of the Glauber model, we involve two-parameter Fermi (2pF) and three-parameter Fermi (3pF) shapes of density distributions, and use the in-medium as well as free behavior of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) amplitude. The results provide enough basis to support the matter radii of exotic isotopes obtained using SDHO densities.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter properties from chiral-scale effective theory including a dilatonic scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Effects of asymmetric dark matter on a magnetized neutron star: A two-fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction between dark matter (DM) and highly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), focusing on how DM particle mass, mass fraction, and magnetic field (MF) strength affect NS structure and stability. We consider self-interacting, nonannihilating, asymmetric fermionic DM that couples to NSs only through gravitational interaction. Using the Quantum Monte Carlo Relativistic Mean Field (QMC-RMF4) model with density-dependent magnetic fields, we investigate the magnetized equation of state and examine the accumulation of DM under various conditions. Our results show that as the DM fraction increases, the maximum gravitational mass of the NS decreases, especially for heavier DM particles, while lighter DM particles can induce a transition from a dark core to a halo structure, increasing the maximum mass. Strong MFs soften the equation of state and reduce the dark mass a NS core can retain before transitioning to a halo. By comparing our results with observations from Neutro Star Interior Composition Explorer and GW170817, we identify the possible range of DM parameters for these objects. We find that the magnetic field slightly changes these limits, mainly affecting the maximum NS mass and tidal deformability. These findings provide key insights into how DM and MF jointly shape the mass-radius relation and the stability of DM-admixed magnetized NSs.</description>

      <title>Modification of single-hole-like states by configuration mixing in the $^{99-131}$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale shell-model calculations are performed for the $9/2^+_{\rm g.s.}$, $1/2^-_1$, $3/2^-_1$, and $5/2^-_1$ states in the odd-$A$ indium isotopes with $N=50-82$. The calculated energy levels, electromagnetic moments, and spectroscopic factors exhibit remarkable agreement with the experimental data due to significant configuration mixing for the neutron numbers away from the closed shells. The $1/2^-_1$ energy levels closely follow the trend of effective single-particle energies, which are determined using the fractional occupancies of neutron orbitals. However, configuration mixing with the proton $p_{3/2}$ and $f_{5/2}$ orbitals in the actual shell-model calculations plays a crucial role in accurately reproducing the positions of the $1/2^-_1$ levels, ensuring better agreement with the experimental data across the entire isotopic chain.</description>

      <title>Low-energy spectra of nobelium isotopes: Skyrme random-phase-approximation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy spectra in the isotopic chain $^{250-262}$No are systematically investigated within the fully self-consistent Quasiparticle Random-Phase-Approximation (QRPA) using Skyrme forces SLy4, SLy6, SkM* and SVbas. QRPA states of multipolarity $\lambda\mu$=20, 22, 30, 31, 32, 33, 43, 44 and 98 are considered. The main attention is paid to isotopes $^{252}$No and $^{254}$No where the most extensive experimental spectroscopic information is available. In these two nuclei, a reasonable description of $K^{\pi}=8^-, 2^-$and $3^+$ isomers is obtained with forces SLy4 and SLy6. The disputed $8^-$ isomer in $^{254}$No is assigned as neutron two-quasiparticle configuration $nn[734\uparrow,613\uparrow]$. The isomers are additionally analyzed using Skyrme functionals UNEDF1, UNEDF2 and UNEDF$^{\rm SO}$. At the energies 1.2 - 1.4 MeV, the 2qp $K$-isomers $4^-, 7^-$ in $^{252}$No and $4^-, 6^-, 7^-$ in $^{254}$No are also predicted. In $^{254}$No, the $K^{\pi}=3^+$ isomer should be accompanied by the nearby $K^{\pi}=4^+$ counterpart. It is shown that, in the chain $^{250-262}$No, some features of $^{252}$No and $^{254}$No should exhibit essential irregularities caused by a noticeable shell gap in the neutron single-particle spectrum and corresponding reduction of the neutron pairing. In particular, low-energy pairing-vibrational $K^{\pi}=0^+$ states in $^{252,254}$No are predicted.</description>

      <title>Examination of the possibility of $\pi^0$ condensation and magnetization in freely interpenetrating nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conditions are found, at which in nuclear matter there may appear a spatially nonuniform $p$ wave $\pi^0$ condensate supplemented by a spatially varying spontaneous magnetization. The pion-nucleon interaction and the anomaly contributions to magnetization are taken into account. Response of the system on external magnetic field is also considered. Then the model of nonoverlapped nucleon Fermi spheres is employed. Arguments are given in favor of possibility of the occurrence of the $\pi^0$-condensation and a spatially varying magnetization as well as effects of pronounced anisotropic pion fluctuations at finite pion momentum in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. Relevant effects such as response on the rotation, charged pion condensation and other are discussed.</description>

      <title>In-medium electromagnetic form factors of pseudoscalar mesons from the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the modifications of hadron structure in a nuclear medium, focusing on the spacelike electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) of light and heavy-light pseudoscalar mesons. By combining the light-front quark model (LFQM) with the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, which reasonably reproduces EMFFs in free space and the saturation properties of nuclear matter, respectively, we systematically analyze the in-medium EMFFs and charge radii of mesons with various quark flavors. Our findings show that the EMFFs of charged (neutral) mesons exhibit a faster fall-off (increase) with increasing four-momentum transfer squared and nuclear density. Consequently, the absolute value of the charge radii of mesons increases with nuclear density, where the rate of increase depends on their quark flavor contents. We observe that the EMFFs of pions and kaons undergo significant modifications in the nuclear medium, while heavy-light mesons are only slightly modified. By decomposing the quark flavor contributions to EMFFs, we show that the medium effects primarily impact the light-quark sector, leaving the heavy-quark sector nearly unaffected. The results of this study further suggest the importance of the medium effects at the quark level.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $S=-1$ meson-baryon interaction: $K^-p$, $\pi^-\Lambda$ and $K^+\Xi^-$ correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the femtoscopic correlation functions of meson-baryon pairs in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, employing unitarized s-wave scattering amplitudes derived from the chiral Lagrangian up to next-to-leading order. For the first time, we deliver predictions on the $\pi^-\Lambda$ and $K^+\Xi^-$ correlation functions which are feasible to be measured at the Large Hadron Collider. We also demonstrate that the employed model is perfectly capable of reproducing the $K^-p$ correlation function data measured by the same collaboration, without the need to modify the coupling strength to the $\bar{K}^0n$ channel, as has been recently suggested. In all cases, the effects of the source size on the correlation are tested. In addition, we present detailed analysis of the different coupled-channel contributions, together with the quantification of the relative relevance of the different terms in the interaction. These calculations require the knowledge of the so-called production weights, for which we present two novel methods to compute them.</description>

      <title>Correlation function for the $p ~f_1(1285)$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have addressed here the problem of calculating the correlation function of a stable particle with a resonance, in particular one resonance that qualifies as a molecular state of two components. The formalism used requires to evaluate the scattering matrix of the stable particle with the molecule, a nuclear problem which we address by means of the fixed center approximation. We have applied the method to the interaction of a proton with the $f_1(1285)$ resonance, presently under investigation by the ALICE collaboration, where the $f_1(1285)$ is taken as a $K^*\bar{K}-\bar{K}^*K$ molecule. We find that the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ interaction develops a resonance state below the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ threshold, which leads to a depletion in the $p ~ f_1(1285)$ correlation function for small values of the proton momentum. The discussion presented shows that these type of studies can provide much information on the nature of some resonances and the existence of three-body bound states involving mesons and baryons.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation functions for axial-vector heavy tetraquarks: A TQ4Q1.1 update</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and discuss the release of novel sets of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for axial-vector, fully heavy $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ and $T_{4b}(1^{+-})$ tetraquarks. Working within the single-parton approximation at leading power and employing nonrelativistic QCD factorization adapted for tetraquark Fock states, we model the initial-scale fragmentation input using a recent calculation for the constituent heavy-quark channel. Standard DGLAP evolution is then applied, ensuring consistent implementation of evolution thresholds. To support phenomenology, we investigate NLL/NLO$^+$ rates for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC from (sym)JETHAD. This study further integrates exotic matter explorations with precision QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Electroexcitation of Nucleon Resonances and the Emergence of Hadron Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing an understanding of phenomena driven by the emergence of hadron mass (EHM) is one of the most challenging problems in the Standard Model. This discussion focuses on the impact of results on nucleon resonance ($N^\ast$) electroexcitation amplitudes (or $\gamma_vpN^\ast$ electrocouplings) obtained from experiments during the 6-GeV era in Hall~B at Jefferson Lab on understanding EHM. Analyzed using continuum Schwinger function methods (CSMs), these results have revealed new pathways for the elucidation of EHM. A good description of the $\Delta(1232)3/2^+$, $N(1440)1/2^+$, and $\Delta(1600)3/2^+$ electrocouplings, achieved by CSM analyses that express a realistic dressed quark mass function, sheds light on the strong interaction dynamics that underlies EHM. Extensions to nucleon resonance studies for higher-mass states are outlined, as well as experimental results anticipated in the 12-GeV era at Jefferson Lab and those that would be enabled by a further increase of the beam energy to 22~GeV.</description>
