      <title>Finite-Particle Rates for Regularized Stein Variational Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive finite-particle rates for the regularized Stein variational gradient descent (R-SVGD) algorithm introduced by He et al. (2024) that corrects the constant-order bias of the SVGD by applying a resolvent-type preconditioner to the kernelized Wasserstein gradient. For the resulting interacting $N$-particle system, we establish explicit non-asymptotic bounds for time-averaged (annealed) empirical measures, illustrating convergence in the \emph{true} (non-kernelized) Fisher information and, under a $\mathrm{W}_1\mathrm{I}$ condition on the target, corresponding $\mathrm{W}_1$ convergence for a large class of smooth kernels. Our analysis covers both continuous- and discrete-time dynamics and yields principled tuning rules for the regularization parameter, step size, and averaging horizon that quantify the trade-off between approximating the Wasserstein gradient flow and controlling finite-particle estimation error.</description>

      <title>Total Variation Rates for Riemannian Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riemannian flow matching (RFM) extends flow-based generative modeling to data supported on manifolds by learning a time-dependent tangent vector field whose flow-ODE transports a simple base distribution to the data law. We develop a nonasymptotic Total Variation (TV) convergence analysis for RFM samplers that use a learned vector field together with Euler discretization on manifolds. Our key technical ingredient is a differential inequality governing the evolution of TV between two manifold ODE flows, which expresses the time-derivative of TV through the divergence of the vector-field mismatch and the score of the reference flow; controlling these terms requires establishing new bounds that explicitly account for parallel transport and curvature. Under smoothness assumptions on the population flow-matching field and either uniform (compact manifolds) or mean-square (Hadamard manifolds) approximation guarantees for the learned field, we obtain explicit bounds of the form $\mathrm{TV}\le C_{\mathrm{Lip}}\,h + C_{\varepsilon}\,\varepsilon$ (with an additional higher-order $\varepsilon^2$ term on compact manifolds), cleanly separating numerical discretization and learning errors. Here, $h$ is the step-size and $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy. Instantiations yield \emph{explicit} polynomial iteration complexities on the hypersphere $S^d$, and on the SPD$(n)$ manifolds under mild moment conditions.</description>

      <title>Radon--Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Interacting-Particle Sampling in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, such as the Fokker--Planck equation and Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evolve a distribution toward a target density known only up to a normalizing constant. We introduce new gradient flows of the KL divergence with a remarkable combination of properties: they admit accurate interacting-particle approximations in high dimensions, and the per-step cost scales linearly in both the number of particles and the dimension. These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic-time Schedules for Scaling Language Models with Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practice, the hyperparameters $(\beta_1, \beta_2)$ and weight-decay $\lambda$ in AdamW are typically kept at fixed values. Is there any reason to do otherwise? We show that for large-scale language model training, the answer is yes: by exploiting the power-law structure of language data, one can design time-varying schedules for $(\beta_1, \beta_2, \lambda)$ that deliver substantial performance gains.
  We study logarithmic-time scheduling, in which the optimizer's gradient memory horizon grows with training time. Although naive variants of this are unstable, we show that suitable damping mechanisms restore stability while preserving the benefits of longer memory. Based on this, we present ADANA, an AdamW-like optimizer that couples log-time schedules with explicit damping to balance stability and performance. We empirically evaluate ADANA across transformer scalings (45M to 2.6B parameters), comparing against AdamW, Muon, and AdEMAMix.
  When properly tuned, ADANA achieves up to 40% compute efficiency relative to a tuned AdamW, with gains that persist--and even improve--as model scale increases. We further show that similar benefits arise when applying logarithmic-time scheduling to AdEMAMix, and that logarithmic-time weight-decay alone can yield significant improvements. Finally, we present variants of ADANA that mitigate potential failure modes and improve robustness.</description>

      <title>Decision-Focused Sequential Experimental Design: A Directional Uncertainty-Guided Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the sequential experimental design problem in the predict-then-optimize paradigm. In this paradigm, the outputs of the prediction model are used as coefficient vectors in a downstream linear optimization problem. Traditional sequential experimental design aims to control the input variables (features) so that the improvement in prediction accuracy from each experimental outcome (label) is maximized. However, in the predict-then-optimize setting, performance is ultimately evaluated based on the decision loss induced by the downstream optimization, rather than by prediction error. This mismatch between prediction accuracy and decision loss renders traditional decision-blind designs inefficient. To address this issue, we propose a directional-based metric to quantify predictive uncertainty. This metric does not require solving an optimization oracle and is therefore computationally tractable. We show that the resulting sequential design criterion enjoys strong consistency and convergence guarantees. Under a broad class of distributions, we demonstrate that our directional uncertainty-based design attains an earlier stopping time than decision-blind designs. This advantage is further supported by real-world experiments on an LLM job allocation problem.</description>

      <title>Variance Reduction Based Experience Replay for Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for complex stochastic systems requires leveraging historical data collected in previous iterations to accelerate policy optimization. Classical experience replay treats all past observations uniformly and fails to account for their varying contributions to learning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Variance Reduction Experience Replay (VRER), a principled framework that selectively reuses informative samples to reduce variance in policy gradient estimation. VRER is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing policy optimization methods, forming the basis of our sample-efficient off-policy algorithm, Policy Gradient with VRER (PG-VRER). Motivated by the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis of experience replay, we develop a novel framework that explicitly captures dependencies introduced by Markovian dynamics and behavior-policy interactions. Using this framework, we establish finite-time convergence guarantees for PG-VRER and reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off: reusing older experience increases bias but simultaneously reduces gradient variance. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that VRER consistently accelerates policy learning and improves performance over state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bayesian Stopping for Efficient Inference of Consistent LLM Answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple strategy for improving LLM accuracy, especially in math and reasoning problems, is to sample multiple responses and submit the answer most consistently reached. In this paper we leverage Bayesian prior information to save on sampling costs, stopping once sufficient consistency is reached. Although the exact posterior is computationally intractable, we further introduce an efficient "L-aggregated" stopping policy that tracks only the L-1 most frequent answer counts. Theoretically, we prove that L=3 is all you need: this coarse approximation is sufficient to achieve asymptotic optimality, and strictly dominates prior-free baselines, while having a fast posterior computation. Empirically, this identifies the most consistent (i.e., mode) LLM answer using fewer samples, and can achieve similar answer accuracy while cutting the number of LLM calls (i.e., saving on LLM inference costs) by up to 50%.</description>

      <title>Fast Rates for Nonstationary Weighted Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted empirical risk minimization is a common approach to prediction under distribution drift. This article studies its out-of-sample prediction error under nonstationarity. We provide a general decomposition of the excess risk into a learning term and an error term associated with distribution drift, and prove oracle inequalities for the learning error under mixing conditions. The learning bound holds uniformly over arbitrary weight classes and accounts for the effective sample size induced by the weight vector, the complexity of the weight and hypothesis classes, and potential data dependence. We illustrate the applicability and sharpness of our results in (auto-) regression problems with linear models, basis approximations, and neural networks, recovering minimax-optimal rates (up to logarithmic factors) when specialized to unweighted and stationary settings.</description>

      <title>Optimal scaling laws in learning hierarchical multi-index models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a sharp theory of scaling laws for two-layer neural networks trained on a class of hierarchical multi-index targets, in a genuinely representation-limited regime. We derive exact information-theoretic scaling laws for subspace recovery and prediction error, revealing how the hierarchical features of the target are sequentially learned through a cascade of phase transitions. We further show that these optimal rates are achieved by a simple, target-agnostic spectral estimator, which can be interpreted as the small learning-rate limit of gradient descent on the first-layer weights. Once an adapted representation is identified, the readout can be learned statistically optimally, using an efficient procedure. As a consequence, we provide a unified and rigorous explanation of scaling laws, plateau phenomena, and spectral structure in shallow neural networks trained on such hierarchical targets.</description>

      <title>Distribution-free two-sample testing with blurred total variation distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-sample testing, where we aim to determine whether two distributions are equal or not equal based on samples from each one, is challenging if we cannot place assumptions on the properties of the two distributions. In particular, certifying equality of distributions, or even providing a tight upper bound on the total variation (TV) distance between the distributions, is impossible to achieve in a distribution-free regime. In this work, we examine the blurred TV distance, a relaxation of TV distance that enables us to perform inference without assumptions on the distributions. We provide theoretical guarantees for distribution-free upper and lower bounds on the blurred TV distance, and examine its properties in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Wedge Sampling: Efficient Tensor Completion with Nearly-Linear Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Wedge Sampling, a new non-adaptive sampling scheme for low-rank tensor completion. We study recovery of an order-$k$ low-rank tensor of dimension $n \times \cdots \times n$ from a subset of its entries. Unlike the standard uniform entry model (i.e., i.i.d. samples from $[n]^k$), wedge sampling allocates observations to structured length-two patterns (wedges) in an associated bipartite sampling graph. By directly promoting these length-two connections, the sampling design strengthens the spectral signal that underlies efficient initialization, in regimes where uniform sampling is too sparse to generate enough informative correlations.
  Our main result shows that this change in sampling paradigm enables polynomial-time algorithms to achieve both weak and exact recovery with nearly linear sample complexity in $n$. The approach is also plug-and-play: wedge-sampling-based spectral initialization can be combined with existing refinement procedures (e.g., spectral or gradient-based methods) using only an additional $\tilde{O}(n)$ uniformly sampled entries, substantially improving over the $\tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ sample complexity typically required under uniform entry sampling for efficient methods. Overall, our results suggest that the statistical-to-computational gap highlighted in Barak and Moitra (2022) is, to a large extent, a consequence of the uniform entry sampling model for tensor completion, and that alternative non-adaptive measurement designs that guarantee a strong initialization can overcome this barrier.</description>

      <title>Transformers Are Born Biased: Structural Inductive Biases at Random Initialization and Their Practical Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers underpin modern large language models (LLMs) and are commonly assumed to be behaviorally unstructured at random initialization, with all meaningful preferences emerging only through large-scale training. We challenge this assumption by showing that randomly initialized transformers already exhibit strong and systematic structural biases. In particular, untrained models display extreme token preferences: across random input sequences, certain tokens are predicted with probabilities orders of magnitude larger.
  We provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon by dissecting the transformer architecture at initialization. We show that extreme token preference arises from a contraction of token representations along a random seed-dependent direction. This contraction is driven by two interacting forces: (i) asymmetric nonlinear activations in MLP sublayers induce global (inter-sequence) representation concentration, and (ii) self-attention further amplifies this effect through local (intra-sequence) aggregation. Together, these mechanisms align hidden representations along a direction determined solely by the random initialization, producing highly non-uniform next-token predictions.
  Beyond mechanistic insight, we demonstrate that these initialization-induced biases persist throughout training, forming a stable and intrinsic model identity. Leveraging this property, we introduce SeedPrint, a fingerprinting method that can reliably distinguish models that differ only in their random initialization, even after extensive training and under substantial distribution shift. Finally, we identify a fundamental positional discrepancy inherent to the attention mechanism's intra-sequence contraction that is causally linked to the attention-sink phenomenon. This discovery provides a principled explanation for the emergence of sinks and offers a pathway for their control.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference on Stopped Random Walks in Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a causal inference problem frequently encountered in online advertising systems, where a publisher (e.g., Instagram, TikTok) interacts repeatedly with human users and advertisers by sporadically displaying to each user an advertisement selected through an auction. Each treatment corresponds to a parameter value of the advertising mechanism (e.g., auction reserve-price), and we want to estimate through experiments the corresponding long-term treatment effect (e.g., annual advertising revenue). In our setting, the treatment affects not only the instantaneous revenue from showing an ad, but also changes each user's interaction-trajectory, and each advertiser's bidding policy -- as the latter is constrained by a finite budget. In particular, each a treatment may even affect the size of the population, since users interact longer with a tolerable advertising mechanism. We drop the classical i.i.d. assumption and model the experiment measurements (e.g., advertising revenue) as a stopped random walk, and use a budget-splitting experimental design, the Anscombe Theorem, a Wald-like equation, and a Central Limit Theorem to construct confidence intervals for the long-term treatment effect.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model's Generalization Can Be Characterized by Inductive Biases toward a Data-Dependent Ridge Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a diffusion model is not memorizing the training data set, how does it generalize exactly? A quantitative understanding of the distribution it generates would be beneficial to, for example, an assessment of the model's performance for downstream applications. We thus explicitly characterize what diffusion model generates, by proposing a log-density ridge manifold and quantifying how the generated data relate to this manifold as inference dynamics progresses. More precisely, inference undergoes a reach-align-slide process centered around the ridge manifold: trajectories first reach a neighborhood of the manifold, then align as being pushed toward or away from the manifold in normal directions, and finally slide along the manifold in tangent directions. Within the scope of this general behavior, different training errors will lead to different normal and tangent motions, which can be quantified, and these detailed motions characterize when inter-mode generations emerge. More detailed understanding of training dynamics will lead to more accurate quantification of the generation inductive bias, and an example of random feature model will be considered, for which we can explicitly illustrate how diffusion model's inductive biases originate as a composition of architectural bias and training accuracy, and how they evolve with the inference dynamics. Experiments on synthetic multimodal distributions and MNIST latent diffusion support the predicted directional effects, in both low- and high-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Denoising diffusion networks for normative modeling in neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normative modeling estimates reference distributions of biological measures conditional on covariates, enabling centiles and clinically interpretable deviation scores to be derived. Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Privacy Amplification Persists under Unlimited Synthetic Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study privacy amplification by synthetic data release, a phenomenon in which differential privacy guarantees are improved by releasing only synthetic data rather than the private generative model itself. Recent work by Pierquin et al. (2025) established the first formal amplification guarantees for a linear generator, but they apply only in asymptotic regimes where the model dimension far exceeds the number of released synthetic records, limiting their practical relevance. In this work, we show a surprising result: under a bounded-parameter assumption, privacy amplification persists even when releasing an unbounded number of synthetic records, thereby improving upon the bounds of Pierquin et al. (2025). Our analysis provides structural insights that may guide the development of tighter privacy guarantees for more complex release mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Does SGD Seek Flatness or Sharpness? An Exactly Solvable Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large body of theory and empirical work hypothesizes a connection between the flatness of a neural network's loss landscape during training and its performance. However, there have been conceptually opposite pieces of evidence regarding when SGD prefers flatter or sharper solutions during training. In this work, we partially but causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD by identifying and exactly solving an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training. In this model, the SGD training has no \textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum. We reproduce this key insight in controlled settings with different model architectures such as MLP, RNN, and transformers.</description>

      <title>Reliable Explanations or Random Noise? A Reliability Metric for XAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.</description>

      <title>Data Kernel Perspective Space Performance Guarantees for Synthetic Data from Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scarcity of labeled training data remains the long pole in the tent for building performant language technology and generative AI models. Transformer models -- particularly LLMs -- are increasingly being used to mitigate the data scarcity problem via synthetic data generation. However, because the models are black boxes, the properties of the synthetic data are difficult to predict. In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). Limitations of the current work and future research are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the Fr{\'e}chet and conditional Fr{\'e}chet mean from data taking values in separable metric spaces. Unlike Euclidean spaces, where well-established methods are available, there is no practical estimator that works universally for all metric spaces. Therefore, we introduce a computable estimator for the Fr{\'e}chet mean based on random quantization techniques and establish its universal consistency across any separable metric spaces. Additionally, we propose another estimator for the conditional Fr{\'e}chet mean, leveraging data-driven partitioning and quantization, and demonstrate its universal consistency when the output space is any Banach space.</description>

      <title>ZeroS: Zero-Sum Linear Attention for Efficient Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Law of the Iterated Logarithm for $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ is a fundamental quantity that appears in lower bounds for (asymptotically) optimal regret of pure-exploration stochastic bandit algorithms, and optimal stopping time of sequential tests. Motivated by this, an empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ statistic is frequently used in the design of (asymptotically) optimal bandit algorithms and sequential tests. While nonasymptotic concentration bounds for the empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ have been developed, their optimality in terms of constants and rates is questionable, and their generality is limited (usually to bounded observations). The fundamental limits of nonasymptotic concentration are often described by the asymptotic fluctuations of the statistics. With that motivation, this paper presents a tight (upper and lower) law of the iterated logarithm for empirical $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ applying to extremely general (unbounded) data.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal sequential change detection for bounded means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of quickest changepoint detection under the Average Run Length (ARL) constraint where the pre-change and post-change laws lie in composite families $\mathscr{P}$ and $\mathscr{Q}$ respectively. In such a problem, a massive challenge is characterizing the best possible detection delay when the "hardest" pre-change law in $\mathscr{P}$ depends on the unknown post-change law $Q\in\mathscr{Q}$. And typical simple-hypothesis likelihood-ratio arguments for Page-CUSUM and Shiryaev-Roberts do not at all apply here. To that end, we derive a universal sharp lower bound in full generality for any ARL-calibrated changepoint detector in the low type-I error ($\gamma\to\infty$ regime) of the order $\log(\gamma)/\mathrm{KL}_{\mathrm{inf}}(Q,\mathscr{P})$. We show achievability of this universal lower bound by proving a tight matching upper bound (with the same sharp $\log\gamma$ constant) in the important bounded mean detection setting. In addition, for separated mean shifts, we also we derive a uniform minimax guarantee of this achievability over the alternatives.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate of the Last Iterate of Stochastic Proximal Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze two classical algorithms for solving additively composite convex optimization problems where the objective is the sum of a smooth term and a nonsmooth regularizer: proximal stochastic gradient method for a single regularizer; and the randomized incremental proximal method, which uses the proximal operator of a randomly selected function when the regularizer is given as the sum of many nonsmooth functions. We focus on relaxing the bounded variance assumption that is common, yet stringent, for getting last iterate convergence rates. We prove the $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate of convergence for the last iterate of both algorithms under componentwise convexity and smoothness, which is optimal up to log terms. Our results apply directly to graph-guided regularizers that arise in multi-task and federated learning, where the regularizer decomposes as a sum over edges of a collaboration graph.</description>

      <title>Solving Stochastic Variational Inequalities without the Bounded Variance Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze algorithms for solving stochastic variational inequalities (VI) without the bounded variance or bounded domain assumptions, where our main focus is min-max optimization with possibly unbounded constraint sets. We focus on two classes of problems: monotone VIs; and structured nonmonotone VIs that admit a solution to the weak Minty VI. The latter assumption allows us to solve structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems. For both classes of VIs, to make the expected residual norm less than $\varepsilon$, we show an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$, which is the best-known for constrained VIs. In our setting, this complexity had been obtained with the bounded variance assumption in the literature, which is not even satisfied for bilinear min-max problems with an unbounded domain. We obtain this complexity for stochastic oracles whose variance can grow as fast as the squared norm of the optimization variable.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes for Bayesian Inference of PDE Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) samplers that enables efficient Bayesian inference in non-linear inverse problems with expensive likelihoods. The key ingredient is a surrogate-assisted thinning scheme in which a surrogate model provides a proposal event rate and a robust correction mechanism enforces an upper bound on the true rate by dynamically adjusting an additive offset whenever violations are detected. This construction is agnostic to the choice of surrogate and PDMP, and we demonstrate it for the Zig-Zag sampler and the Bouncy particle sampler with constant, Laplace, and Gaussian process (GP) surrogates, including gradient-informed and adaptively refined GP variants. As a representative application, we consider Bayesian inference of a spatially varying Young's modulus in a one-dimensional linear elasticity problem. Across dimensions, PDMP samplers equipped with GP-based surrogates achieve substantially higher accuracy and effective sample size per forward model evaluation than Random Walk Metropolis algorithm and the No-U-Turn sampler. The Bouncy particle sampler exhibits the most favorable overall efficiency and scaling, illustrating the potential of the proposed PDMP framework beyond this particular setting.</description>

      <title>Joint Embedding Variational Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Variational Joint Embedding (VJE), a framework that synthesizes joint embedding and variational inference to enable self-supervised learning of probabilistic representations in a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive setting. Compared to energy-based predictive objectives that optimize pointwise discrepancies, VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) for a latent-variable model defined directly on encoder embeddings. We instantiate the conditional likelihood with a heavy-tailed Student-$t$ model using a polar decomposition that explicitly decouples directional and radial factors to prevent norm-induced instabilities during training. VJE employs an amortized inference network to parameterize a diagonal Gaussian variational posterior whose feature-wise variances are shared with the likelihood scale to capture anisotropic uncertainty without auxiliary projection heads. Across ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10, VJE achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines under linear and k-NN evaluation. We further validate these probabilistic semantics through one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection, where likelihood-based scoring under the proposed model outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines.</description>

      <title>Limitations of SGD for Multi-Index Models Beyond Statistical Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the limitations of gradient methods, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in particular, is a central challenge in learning theory. To that end, a commonly used tool is the Statistical Queries (SQ) framework, which studies performance limits of algorithms based on noisy interaction with the data. However, it is known that the formal connection between the SQ framework and SGD is tenuous: Existing results typically rely on adversarial or specially-structured gradient noise that does not reflect the noise in standard SGD, and (as we point out here) can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Moreover, many analyses of SGD for challenging problems rely on non-trivial algorithmic modifications, such as restricting the SGD trajectory to the sphere or using very small learning rates. To address these shortcomings, we develop a new, non-SQ framework to study the limitations of standard vanilla SGD, for single-index and multi-index models (namely, when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the inputs). Our results apply to a broad class of settings and architectures, including (potentially deep) neural networks.</description>

      <title>Muon in Associative Memory Learning: Training Dynamics and Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.</description>

      <title>Selecting Hyperparameters for Tree-Boosting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-boosting is a widely used machine learning technique for tabular data. However, its out-of-sample accuracy is critically dependent on multiple hyperparameters. In this article, we empirically compare several popular methods for hyperparameter optimization for tree-boosting including random grid search, the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), Gaussian-process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), Hyperband, the sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC) method, and deterministic full grid search using $59$ regression and classification data sets. We find that the SMAC method clearly outperforms all the other considered methods. We further observe that (i) a relatively large number of trials larger than $100$ is required for accurate tuning, (ii) using default values for hyperparameters yields very inaccurate models, (iii) all considered hyperparameters can have a material effect on the accuracy of tree-boosting, i.e., there is no small set of hyperparameters that is more important than others, and (iv) choosing the number of boosting iterations using early stopping yields more accurate results compared to including it in the search space for regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Price of universality in vector quantization is at most 0.11 bit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast computation of a matrix product $W^\top X$ is a workhorse of modern LLMs. To make their deployment more efficient, a popular approach is that of using a low-precision approximation $\widehat W$ in place of true $W$ ("weight-only quantization''). Information theory demonstrates that an optimal algorithm for reducing precision of $W$ depends on the (second order) statistics of $X$ and requires a careful alignment of vector quantization codebook with PCA directions of $X$ (a process known as "waterfilling allocation''). Dependence of the codebook on statistics of $X$, however, is highly impractical. This paper proves that there exist a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of $X$, in the sense of being at least as good as an $X$-adapted waterfilling codebook with rate reduced by 0.11 bit per dimension. Such universal codebook would be an ideal candidate for the low-precision storage format, a topic of active modern research, but alas the existence proof is non-constructive.
  Equivalently, our result shows existence of a net in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is a nearly-optimal covering of a sphere simultaneously with respect to all Hilbert norms.</description>

      <title>Learning False Discovery Rate Control via Model-Based Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in high-dimensional variable selection requires balancing rigorous error control with statistical power. Existing methods with provable guarantees are often overly conservative, creating a persistent gap between the realized false discovery proportion (FDP) and the target FDR level. We introduce a learning-augmented enhancement of the T-Rex Selector framework that narrows this gap. Our approach replaces the analytical FDP estimator with a neural network trained solely on diverse synthetic datasets, enabling a substantially tighter and more accurate approximation of the FDP. This refinement allows the procedure to operate much closer to the desired FDR level, thereby increasing discovery power while maintaining effective approximate control. Through extensive simulations and a challenging synthetic genome-wide association study (GWAS), we demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection of true variables compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Inventory Control with Lead Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-stationary single-item, periodic-review inventory control problems in which the demand distribution is unknown and may change over time. We analyze how demand non-stationarity affects learning performance across inventory models, including systems with demand backlogging or lost-sales, both with and without lead times. For each setting, we propose an adaptive online algorithm that optimizes over the class of base-stock policies and establish performance guarantees in terms of dynamic regret relative to the optimal base-stock policy at each time step. Our results reveal a sharp separation across inventory models. In backlogging systems and lost-sales models with zero lead time, we show that it is possible to adapt to demand changes without incurring additional performance loss in stationary environments, even without prior knowledge of the demand distributions or the number of demand shifts. In contrast, for lost-sales systems with positive lead times, we establish weaker guarantees that reflect fundamental limitations imposed by delayed replenishment in combination with censored feedback. Our algorithms leverage the convexity and one-sided feedback structure of inventory costs to enable counterfactual policy evaluation despite demand censoring. We complement the theoretical analysis with simulation results showing that our methods significantly outperform existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Principled Confidence Estimation for Deep Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Exact Recovery in the Data Block Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection in networks is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistical inference, with applications in social networks, biological systems, and communication networks. The stochastic block model (SBM) serves as a canonical framework for studying community structure, and exact recovery, identifying the true communities with high probability, is a central theoretical question. While classical results characterize the phase transition for exact recovery based solely on graph connectivity, many real-world networks contain additional data, such as node attributes or labels. In this work, we study exact recovery in the Data Block Model (DBM), an SBM augmented with node-associated data, as formalized by Asadi, Abbe, and Verd\'{u} (2017). We introduce the Chernoff--TV divergence and use it to characterize a sharp exact recovery threshold for the DBM. We further provide an efficient algorithm that achieves this threshold, along with a matching converse result showing impossibility below the threshold. Finally, simulations validate our findings and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating vertex data as side information in community detection.</description>

      <title>CFRecs: Counterfactual Recommendations on Real Estate User Listing Interaction Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and powerful in representing complex relationships in many online platforms. While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.</description>

      <title>$f$-GRPO and Beyond: Divergence-Based Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for General LLM Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.</description>

      <title>Discrete diffusion samplers and bridges: Off-policy algorithms and applications in latent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schr\"odinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.</description>

      <title>Inverse Depth Scaling From Most Layers Being Similar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in large language models (LLMs), yet depth and width may contribute to performance differently, requiring more detailed studies. Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.</description>

      <title>Improved Generalization Bounds for Transductive Learning by Transductive Local Complexity and Its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16858v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Transductive Local Complexity (TLC) to extend the classical Local Rademacher Complexity (LRC) to the transductive setting, incorporating substantial and novel components. Although LRC has been used to obtain sharp generalization bounds and minimax rates for inductive tasks such as classification and nonparametric regression, it has remained an open problem whether a localized Rademacher complexity framework can be effectively adapted to transductive learning to achieve sharp or nearly sharp bounds consistent with inductive results. We provide an affirmative answer via TLC. TLC is constructed by first deriving a new concentration inequality in Theorem 4.1 for the supremum of empirical processes capturing the gap between test and training losses, termed the test-train process, under uniform sampling without replacement, which leverages a novel combinatorial property of the test-train process and a new proof strategy applying the exponential Efron-Stein inequality twice. A subsequent peeling strategy applied to a new decomposition of the expectation of the test-train process and a new surrogate variance operator then yield excess risk bounds in the transductive setting that are nearly consistent with classical LRC-based inductive bounds up to a logarithmic gap. We further advance transductive learning through two applications: (1) for realizable transductive learning over binary-valued classes with finite VC dimension of $\dVC$ and $u \ge m \ge \dVC$, where $u$ and $m$ are the number of test features and training features, our Theorem 6.1 gives a nearly optimal bound $\Theta(\dVC \log(me/\dVC)/m)$ matching the minimax rate $\Theta(\dVC/m)$ up to $\log m$, resolving a decade-old open question; and (2) Theorem 6.2 presents a sharper excess risk bound for transductive kernel learning compared to the current state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>ARM: Refining Multivariate Forecasting with Adaptive Temporal-Contextual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is important for various domains but is confronted by challenges in handling the complex temporal-contextual relationships. As multivariate input models underperforming some recent univariate counterparts, we posit that the issue lies in the inefficiency of existing multivariate LTSF Transformers to model series-wise relationships: the characteristic differences between series are often captured incorrectly. To address this, we introduce ARM: a multivariate temporal-contextual adaptive learning method, which is an enhanced architecture specifically designed for multivariate LTSF modelling. ARM employs Adaptive Univariate Effect Learning (AUEL), Random Dropping (RD) training strategy, and Multi-kernel Local Smoothing (MKLS), to better handle individual series temporal patterns and correctly learn inter-series dependencies. ARM demonstrates superior performance on multiple benchmarks without significantly increasing computational costs compared to vanilla Transformer, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in LTSF. ARM is also generally applicable to other LTSF architecture beyond vanilla Transformer.</description>

Abstract: For Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF), recent deep learning applications show that univariate models frequently outperform multivariate ones. To address the difficiency in multivariate models, we introduce a method to Construct Auxiliary Time Series (CATS) that functions like a 2D temporal-contextual attention mechanism, which generates Auxiliary Time Series (ATS) from Original Time Series (OTS) to effectively represent and incorporate inter-series relationships for forecasting. Key principles of ATS - continuity, sparsity, and variability - are identified and implemented through different modules. Even with a basic 2-layer MLP as core predictor, CATS achieves state-of-the-art, significantly reducing complexity and parameters compared to previous multivariate models, marking it an efficient and transferable MTSF solution.</description>

      <title>Root Cause Analysis of Outliers with Missing Structural Knowledge</title>

Abstract: The goal of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is to explain why an anomaly occurred by identifying where the fault originated. Several recent works model the anomalous event as resulting from a change in the causal mechanism at the root cause, i.e., as a soft intervention. RCA is then the task of identifying which causal mechanism changed. In real-world applications, one often has either few or only a single sample from the post-intervention distribution: a severe limitation for most methods, which assume one knows or can estimate the distribution. However, even those that do not are statistically ill-posed due to the need to probe regression models in regions of low probability density. In this paper, we propose simple, efficient methods to overcome both difficulties in the case where there is a single root cause and the causal graph is a polytree. When one knows the causal graph, we give guarantees for a traversal algorithm that requires only marginal anomaly scores and does not depend on specifying an arbitrary anomaly score cut-off. When one does not know the causal graph, we show that the heuristic of identifying root causes as the variables with the highest marginal anomaly scores is causally justified. To this end, we prove that anomalies with small scores are unlikely to cause those with larger scores in polytrees and give upper bounds for the likelihood of causal pathways with non-monotonic anomaly scores.</description>

      <title>Conditional regression for the Nonlinear Single-Variable Model</title>

Abstract: Regressing a function $F$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ without the statistical and computational curse of dimensionality requires special statistical models, for example that impose geometric assumptions on the distribution of the data (e.g., that its support is low-dimensional), or strong smoothness assumptions on $F$, or a special structure $F$. Among the latter, compositional models $F=f\circ g$ with $g$ mapping to $\mathbb{R}^r$ with $r\ll d$ include classical single- and multi-index models, as well as neural networks. While the case where $g$ is linear is well-understood, less is known when $g$ is nonlinear, and in particular for which $g$'s the curse of dimensionality in estimating $F$, or both $f$ and $g$, may be circumvented. Here we consider a model $F(X):=f(\Pi_\gamma X)$ where $\Pi_\gamma:\mathbb{R}^d\to[0,\textrm{len}_\gamma]$ is the closest-point projection onto the parameter of a regular curve $\gamma:[0, \textrm{len}_\gamma]\to\mathbb{R}^d$, and $f:[0,\textrm{len}_\gamma]\to \mathbb{R}^1$. The input data $X$ is not low-dimensional: it can be as far from $\gamma$ as the condition that $\Pi_\gamma(X)$ is well-defined allows. The distribution $X$, the curve $\gamma$ and the function $f$ are all unknown. This model is a natural nonlinear generalization of the single-index model, corresponding to $\gamma$ being a line. We propose a nonparametric estimator, based on conditional regression, that under suitable assumptions, the strongest of which being that $f$ is coarsely monotone, achieves, up to log factors, the $\textit{one-dimensional}$ optimal min-max rate for non-parametric regression, up to the level of noise in the observations, and be constructed in time $\mathcal{O}(d^2 n\log n)$. All the constants in the learning bounds, in the minimal number of samples required for our bounds to hold, and in the computational complexity are at most low-order polynomials in $d$.</description>

      <title>A Representer Theorem for Hawkes Processes via Penalized Least Squares Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representer theorem is a cornerstone of kernel methods, which aim to estimate latent functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) in a nonparametric manner. Its significance lies in converting inherently infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional ones over dual coefficients, thereby enabling practical and computationally tractable algorithms. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the latent triggering kernels--functions that encode the interaction structure between events--for linear multivariate Hawkes processes based on observed event sequences within an RKHS framework. We show that, under the principle of penalized least squares minimization, a novel form of representer theorem emerges: a family of transformed kernels can be defined via a system of simultaneous integral equations, and the optimal estimator of each triggering kernel is expressed as a linear combination of these transformed kernels evaluated at the data points. Remarkably, the dual coefficients are all analytically fixed to unity, obviating the need to solve a costly optimization problem to obtain the dual coefficients. This leads to a highly efficient estimator capable of handling large-scale data more effectively than conventional nonparametric approaches. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets reveal that the proposed method attains competitive predictive accuracy while substantially improving computational efficiency over existing state-of-the-art kernel method-based estimators.</description>

      <title>How Data Mixing Shapes In-Context Learning: Asymptotic Equivalence for Transformers with MLPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained Transformers demonstrate remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without parameter updates. However, theoretical studies often rely on simplified architectures (e.g., omitting MLPs), plain data models (e.g., linear regression with isotropic inputs), and single-source training, limiting their relevance to realistic settings. In this work, we study ICL in pretrained Transformers with nonlinear MLP heads on nonlinear tasks drawn from multiple data sources with heterogeneous input, task, and noise distributions. We analyze a model where the MLP comprises two layers, with the first layer trained via a single gradient step and the second layer fully optimized. Under high-dimensional asymptotics, we prove that such models are equivalent in ICL error to structured polynomial predictors, leveraging results from the theory of Gaussian universality and orthogonal polynomials. This equivalence reveals that nonlinear MLPs meaningfully enhance ICL performance, particularly on nonlinear tasks, compared to linear baselines. It also enables a precise analysis of data mixing effects: we identify key properties of high-quality data sources (low noise, structured covariances) and show that feature learning emerges only when the task covariance exhibits sufficient structure. These results are validated empirically across various activation functions, model sizes, and data distributions. Finally, we experiment with a real-world scenario involving multilingual sentiment analysis where each language is treated as a different source. Our experimental results for this case exemplify how our findings extend to real-world cases. Overall, our work advances the theoretical foundations of ICL in Transformers and provides actionable insight into the role of architecture and data in ICL.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Learn Generic Multi-Index Models Near Information-Theoretic Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In deep learning, a central issue is to understand how neural networks efficiently learn high-dimensional features. To this end, we explore the gradient descent learning of a general Gaussian Multi-index model $f(\boldsymbol{x})=g(\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{x})$ with hidden subspace $\boldsymbol{U}\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$, which is the canonical setup to study representation learning. We prove that under generic non-degenerate assumptions on the link function, a standard two-layer neural network trained via layer-wise gradient descent can agnostically learn the target with $o_d(1)$ test error using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$ time. The sample and time complexity both align with the information-theoretic limit up to leading order and are therefore optimal. During the first stage of gradient descent learning, the proof proceeds via showing that the inner weights can perform a power-iteration process. This process implicitly mimics a spectral start for the whole span of the hidden subspace and eventually eliminates finite-sample noise and recovers this span. It surprisingly indicates that optimal results can only be achieved if the first layer is trained for more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps. This work demonstrates the ability of neural networks to effectively learn hierarchical functions with respect to both sample and time efficiency.</description>

      <title>Local EGOP for Continuous Index Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the setting of continuous index learning, in which a function of many variables varies only along a small number of directions at each point. For efficient estimation, it is beneficial for a learning algorithm to adapt, near each point $x$, to the subspace that captures the local variability of the function $f$. We pose this task as kernel adaptation along a manifold with noise, and introduce Local EGOP learning, a recursive algorithm that utilizes the Expected Gradient Outer Product (EGOP) quadratic form as both a metric and inverse-covariance of our target distribution. We prove that Local EGOP learning adapts to the regularity of the function of interest, showing that under a supervised noisy manifold hypothesis, intrinsic dimensional learning rates are achieved for arbitrarily high-dimensional noise. Empirically, we compare our algorithm to the feature learning capabilities of deep learning. Additionally, we demonstrate improved regression quality compared to two-layer neural networks in the continuous single-index setting.</description>

      <title>Provably Reliable Classifier Guidance via Cross-Entropy Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models generate conditional samples by augmenting the reverse-time score with the gradient of the log-probability predicted by a probabilistic classifier. In practice, this classifier is usually obtained by minimizing an empirical loss function. While existing statistical theory guarantees good generalization performance when the sample size is sufficiently large, it remains unclear whether such training yields an effective guidance mechanism.
  We study this question in the context of cross-entropy loss, which is widely used for classifier training. Under mild smoothness assumptions on the classifier, we show that controlling the cross-entropy at each diffusion model step is sufficient to control the corresponding guidance error. In particular, probabilistic classifiers achieving conditional KL divergence $\varepsilon^2$ induce guidance vectors with mean squared error $\widetilde O(d \varepsilon )$, up to constant and logarithmic factors. Our result yields an upper bound on the sampling error of classifier-guided diffusion models and bears resemblance to a reverse log-Sobolev--type inequality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that quantitatively links classifier training to guidance alignment in diffusion models, providing both a theoretical explanation for the empirical success of classifier guidance, and principled guidelines for selecting classifiers that induce effective guidance.</description>

      <title>Statsformer: Validated Ensemble Learning with LLM-Derived Semantic Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Statsformer, a principled framework for integrating large language model (LLM)-derived knowledge into supervised statistical learning. Existing approaches are limited in adaptability and scope: they either inject LLM guidance as an unvalidated heuristic, which is sensitive to LLM hallucination, or embed semantic information within a single fixed learner. Statsformer overcomes both limitations through a guardrailed ensemble architecture. We embed LLM-derived feature priors within an ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners, adaptively calibrating their influence via cross-validation. This design yields a flexible system with an oracle-style guarantee that it performs no worse than any convex combination of its in-library base learners, up to statistical error. Empirically, informative priors yield consistent performance improvements, while uninformative or misspecified LLM guidance is automatically downweighted, mitigating the impact of hallucinations across a diverse range of prediction tasks.An open-source implementation of Statsformer is available at https://github.com/pilancilab/statsformer.</description>

Abstract: Recent Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate in-context learning ability to perform various functions based solely on the provided context, without updating model parameters. To fully utilize the in-context capabilities in time series forecasting (TSF) problems, unlike previous Transformer-based or LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we reformulate "time series forecasting tasks" as input tokens by constructing a series of (lookback, future) pairs within the tokens. This method aligns more closely with the inherent in-context mechanisms, and is more parameter-efficient without the need of using pre-trained LLM parameters. Furthermore, it addresses issues such as overfitting in existing Transformer-based TSF models, consistently achieving better performance across full-data, few-shot, and zero-shot settings compared to previous architectures.</description>

      <title>WAVE: Weighted Autoregressive Varying Gate for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03159v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Weighted Autoregressive Varying gatE (WAVE) attention mechanism equipped with both Autoregressive (AR) and Moving-average (MA) components. It can adapt to various attention mechanisms, enhancing and decoupling their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that WAVE attention that incorporates the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>GAMformer: Bridging Tabular Foundation Models and Interpretable Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While interpretability is crucial for machine learning applications in safety-critical domains and for regulatory compliance, existing tabular foundation models like TabPFN lack transparency. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) provide the needed interpretability through their additive structure, but traditional GAM methods rely on iterative learning algorithms (such as splines, boosted trees, or neural networks) that are fundamentally incompatible with the in-context learning paradigm of foundation models. In this paper, we introduce GAMformer, the first tabular foundation model for GAMs that bridges the gap between the power of foundation models and the interpretability requirements of critical real-world applications. GAMformer estimates GAM shape functions in a single forward pass using in-context learning, representing a significant departure from conventional iterative approaches. Building on previous research on tabular foundation models, we train GAMformer exclusively on synthetically generated tables to prevent data leakage. Our experiments demonstrate that GAMformer performs comparably to other leading GAMs across various classification benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Linear Transformers as VAR Models: Aligning Autoregressive Attention Mechanisms with Autoregressive Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive attention-based time series forecasting (TSF) has drawn increasing interest, with mechanisms like linear attention sometimes outperforming vanilla attention. However, deeper Transformer architectures frequently misalign with autoregressive objectives, obscuring the underlying VAR structure embedded within linear attention and hindering their ability to capture the data generative processes in TSF. In this work, we first show that a single linear attention layer can be interpreted as a dynamic vector autoregressive (VAR) structure. We then explain that existing multi-layer Transformers have structural mismatches with the autoregressive forecasting objective, which impair interpretability and generalization ability. To address this, we show that by rearranging the MLP, attention, and input-output flow, multi-layer linear attention can also be aligned as a VAR model. Then, we propose Structural Aligned Mixture of VAR (SAMoVAR), a linear Transformer variant that integrates interpretable dynamic VAR weights for multivariate TSF. By aligning the Transformer architecture with autoregressive objectives, SAMoVAR delivers improved performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency, comparing to SOTA TSF models.</description>

      <title>Statistical description and dimension reduction of continuous time categorical trajectories with multivariate functional principal components</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09986v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Getting tools that allow simple representations and comparisons of a set of categorical trajectories is of major interest for statisticians. Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random indicator function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical description of the categorical trajectories into a multivariate functional principal components analysis. This viewpoint encompasses experimental frameworks where two or more states can be observed simultaneously. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, the means and the (multivariate) covariance function are continuous and have interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities. Considering a functional data point of view, we show that the binary trajectories, which are right-continuous functions with left-hand limits, can be seen as random elements in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions. The multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret and we show that we can get consistent estimators of the mean trajectories and the covariance functions under weak regularity assumptions. The ability of the approach to represent categorical trajectories in a small dimension space is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments.</description>

      <title>Guided Diffusion Sampling on Function Spaces with Applications to PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an unconditional, discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional Banach spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and inverse problems in the context of PDEs.

      <title>SelfReflect: Can LLMs Communicate Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20295v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The common approach to communicate a large language model's (LLM) uncertainty is to add a percentage number or a hedging word to its response. But is this all we can do? Instead of generating a single answer and then hedging it, an LLM that is fully transparent to the user needs to be able to reflect on its internal belief distribution and output a summary of all options it deems possible, and how likely they are. To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context. This simple approach shines a light at the universal way of communicating LLM uncertainties whose future development the SelfReflect score enables. To support the development of this universal form of LLM uncertainties, we publish the code that implements our metric for arbitrary LLMs under https://github.com/apple/ml-selfreflect .</description>

      <title>PolarGrad: A Class of Matrix-Gradient Optimizers from a Unifying Preconditioning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21799v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ever-growing scale of deep learning models and training data underscores the critical importance of efficient optimization methods. While preconditioned gradient methods such as Adam and AdamW are the de facto optimizers for training neural networks and large language models, structure-aware preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo and Muon, which utilize the matrix structure of gradients, have demonstrated promising evidence of faster convergence. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for analyzing "matrix-aware" preconditioned methods, which not only sheds light on the effectiveness of Muon and related optimizers but also leads to a class of new structure-aware preconditioned methods. A key contribution of this framework is its precise distinction between preconditioning strategies that treat neural network weights as vectors (addressing curvature anisotropy) versus those that consider their matrix structure (addressing gradient anisotropy). This perspective provides new insights into several empirical phenomena in language model pre-training, including Adam's training instabilities, Muon's accelerated convergence, and the necessity of learning rate warmup for Adam. Building upon this framework, we introduce PolarGrad, a new class of preconditioned optimization methods based on the polar decomposition of matrix-valued gradients. As a special instance, PolarGrad includes Muon with updates scaled by the nuclear norm of the gradients. We provide numerical implementations of these methods, leveraging efficient numerical polar decomposition algorithms for enhanced convergence. Our extensive evaluations across diverse matrix optimization problems and language model pre-training tasks demonstrate that PolarGrad outperforms both Adam and Muon.</description>

      <title>"Faithful to What?" On the Limits of Fidelity-Based Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In explainable AI, surrogate models are commonly evaluated by their fidelity to a neural network's predictions. Fidelity, however, measures alignment to a learned model rather than alignment to the data-generating signal underlying the task. This work introduces the linearity score $\lambda(f)$, a diagnostic that quantifies the extent to which a regression network's input--output behavior is linearly decodable. $\lambda(f)$ is defined as an $R^2$ measure of surrogate fit to the network. Across synthetic and real-world regression datasets, we find that surrogates can achieve high fidelity to a neural network while failing to recover the predictive gains that distinguish the network from simpler models. In several cases, high-fidelity surrogates underperform even linear baselines trained directly on the data. These results demonstrate that explaining a model's behavior is not equivalent to explaining the task-relevant structure of the data, highlighting a limitation of fidelity-based explanations when used to reason about predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Explanations are a Means to an End: Decision Theoretic Explanation Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explanations of model behavior are commonly evaluated via proxy properties weakly tied to the purposes explanations serve in practice. We contribute a decision theoretic framework that treats explanations as information signals valued by the expected improvement they enable on a specified decision task. This approach yields three distinct estimands: 1) a theoretical benchmark that upperbounds achievable performance by any agent with the explanation, 2) a human-complementary value that quantifies the theoretically attainable value that is not already captured by a baseline human decision policy, and 3) a behavioral value representing the causal effect of providing the explanation to human decision-makers. We instantiate these definitions in a practical validation workflow, and apply them to assess explanation potential and interpret behavioral effects in human-AI decision support and mechanistic interpretability.</description>

      <title>AdapDISCOM: An Adaptive Sparse Regression Method for High-Dimensional Multimodal Data With Block-Wise Missingness and Measurement Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal high-dimensional data are increasingly prevalent in biomedical research, yet they are often compromised by block-wise missingness and measurement errors, posing significant challenges for statistical inference and prediction. We propose AdapDISCOM, a novel adaptive direct sparse regression method that simultaneously addresses these two pervasive issues. Building on the DISCOM framework, AdapDISCOM introduces modality-specific weighting schemes to account for heterogeneity in data structures and error magnitudes across modalities. We establish the theoretical properties of AdapDISCOM, including model selection consistency and convergence rates under sub-Gaussian and heavy-tailed settings, and develop robust and computationally efficient variants (AdapDISCOM-Huber and Fast-AdapDISCOM). Extensive simulations demonstrate that AdapDISCOM consistently outperforms existing methods such as DISCOM, SCOM, and CoCoLasso, particularly under heterogeneous contamination and heavy-tailed distributions. Finally, we apply AdapDISCOM to Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, demonstrating improved prediction of cognitive scores and reliable selection of established biomarkers, even with substantial missingness and measurement errors. AdapDISCOM provides a flexible, robust, and scalable framework for high-dimensional multimodal data analysis under realistic data imperfections.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to dimension-free self-normalized concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the self-normalized concentration of vector-valued stochastic processes. We focus on bounds for "sub-$\psi$" processes, a well-known and quite general class of process that encompasses a wide variety of well-known tail conditions (including sub-exponential, sub-Gaussian, sub-gamma, sub-Poisson, and several heavy-tailed settings without a moment generating function such as symmetric or bounded 2nd or 3rd moments). Our results recover and generalize the influential bound of de la Pe\~na et al. [20] (proved again in Abbasi-Yadkori et al. [2]) in the sub-Gaussian case. Further, we fill a gap in the literature between determinant-based bounds and more recent bounds based on condition numbers. As applications we prove a Bernstein inequality for random vectors satisfying a moment condition (a more general condition than boundedness), and also provide the first dimension-free self-normalized empirical Bernstein inequality. Our techniques are based on the variational (PAC-Bayes) approach to concentration.</description>

      <title>A Sketch-and-Project Analysis of Subsampled Natural Gradient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNG) has been used to enable high-precision scientific machine learning, but standard analyses based on stochastic preconditioning fail to provide insight into realistic small-sample settings. We overcome this limitation by instead analyzing SNG as a sketch-and-project method. Motivated by this lens, we discard the usual theoretical proxy which decouples gradients and preconditioners using two independent mini-batches, and we replace it with a new proxy based on squared volume sampling. Under this new proxy we show that the expectation of the SNG direction becomes equal to a preconditioned gradient descent step even in the presence of coupling, leading to (i) global convergence guarantees when using a single mini-batch of any size, and (ii) an explicit characterization of the convergence rate in terms of quantities related to the sketch-and-project structure. These findings in turn yield new insights into small-sample settings, for example by suggesting that the advantage of SNG over SGD is that it can more effectively exploit spectral decay in the model Jacobian. We also extend these ideas to explain a popular structured momentum scheme for SNG, known as SPRING, by showing that it arises naturally from accelerated sketch-and-project methods.</description>

      <title>On optimal solutions of classical and sliced Wasserstein GANs with non-Gaussian data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been widely applied in reinforcement and semi-supervised learning as well as computer vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search, and only a few selection methods have been proven to be theoretically optimal. One of the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on optimal parameters for population WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) setting, where the generator NN is linear, and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of optimal solutions of population WGAN beyond the LQG setting. As a basic result, closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGAN are derived when the NN has non-linear activation functions, and the data is non-Gaussian. For high-dimensional data, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein framework and show that the linear generator can be asymptotically optimal. Moreover, the original sliced WGAN only constrains the projected data marginal instead of the whole one in classical WGAN, and thus, we propose another new unprojected sliced WGAN and identify its asymptotic optimality. Empirical studies show that compared to the celebrated r-principal component analysis (r-PCA) solution, which has cubic complexity to the data dimension, our generator for sliced WGAN can achieve better performance with only linear complexity.</description>

      <title>Informed Asymmetric Actor-Critic: Leveraging Privileged Signals Beyond Full-State Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric actor-critic methods are widely used in partially observable reinforcement learning, but typically assume full state observability to condition the critic during training, which is often unrealistic in practice. We introduce the informed asymmetric actor-critic framework, allowing the critic to be conditioned on arbitrary state-dependent privileged signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that any such privileged signal yields unbiased policy gradient estimates, substantially expanding the set of admissible privileged information. This raises the problem of selecting the most adequate privileged information in order to improve learning. For this purpose, we propose two novel informativeness criteria: a dependence-based test that can be applied prior to training, and a criterion based on improvements in value prediction accuracy that can be applied post-hoc. Empirical results on partially observable benchmark tasks and synthetic environments demonstrate that carefully selected privileged signals can match or outperform full-state asymmetric baselines while relying on strictly less state information.</description>

      <title>Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024, Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably, the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm, which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}} \right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Constraint-Based Causal Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions, and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches. Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores, obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes, surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available at https://github$.$com/PurdueMINDS/DAGPA.</description>

      <title>A Single-Loop First-Order Algorithm for Linearly Constrained Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problems are strongly convex and have coupled linear constraints. To overcome the potential non-smoothness of the hyper-objective and the computational challenges associated with the Hessian matrix, we utilize penalty and augmented Lagrangian methods to reformulate the original problem as a single-level one. Especially, we establish a strong theoretical connection between the reformulated function and the original hyper-objective by characterizing the closeness of their values and derivatives. Based on this reformulation, we propose a single-loop, first-order algorithm for linearly constrained bilevel optimization (SFLCB). We provide rigorous analyses of its non-asymptotic convergence rates, showing an improvement over prior double-loop algorithms -- form $O(\epsilon^{-3}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. The experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed SFLCB algorithm. Simulation code is provided at https://github.com/ShenGroup/SFLCB.</description>

      <title>TempoPFN: Synthetic Pre-training of Linear RNNs for Zero-shot Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval, fev-bench and Chronos-ZS benchmarks, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>TabPFN-2.5: Advancing the State of the Art in Tabular Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (&lt;=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Partial Feedback Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new learning protocol, termed partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of acceptable labels, but the learner observes only one acceptable label per round. We highlight that, while classical version space is widely used for online learnability, it does not directly extend to this setting. We address this obstacle by introducing a collection version space, which maintains sets of hypotheses rather than individual hypotheses. Using this tool, we obtain a tight characterization of learnability in the set-realizable regime. In particular, we define the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim), and show that they tightly characterize the minimax regret for deterministic and randomized learners, respectively. We further identify a nested inclusion condition under which deterministic and randomized learnability coincide, resolving an open question of Raman et al. (2024b). Finally, given a hypothesis space H, we show that beyond set realizability, the minimax regret can be linear even when |H|=2, highlighting a barrier beyond set realizability.</description>

      <title>Minimax optimal differentially private synthetic data for smooth queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private synthetic data enables the sharing and analysis of sensitive datasets while providing rigorous privacy guarantees for individual contributors. A central challenge is to achieve strong utility guarantees for meaningful downstream analysis. Many existing methods ensure uniform accuracy over broad query classes, such as all Lipschitz functions, but this level of generality often leads to suboptimal rates for statistics of practical interest. Since many common data analysis queries exhibit smoothness beyond what worst-case Lipschitz bounds capture, we ask whether exploiting this additional structure can yield improved utility.
  We study the problem of generating $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data from a dataset of size $n$ supported on the hypercube $[-1,1]^d$, with utility guarantees uniformly for all smooth queries having bounded derivatives up to order $k$. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a minimax error rate of $n^{-\min \{1, \frac{k}{d}\}}$, up to a $\log(n)$ factor. This characterization uncovers a phase transition at $k=d$. Our results generalize the Chebyshev moment matching framework of (Musco et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2016) and strictly improve the error rates for $k$-smooth queries established in (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, we establish the first minimax lower bound for the utility of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data with respect to $k$-smooth queries, extending the Wasserstein lower bound for $\varepsilon$-differential privacy in (Boedihardjo et al., 2024).</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks from Causal Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely used to quantify training data memorization and assess privacy risks. Standard evaluation requires repeated retraining, which is computationally costly for large models. One-run methods (single training with randomized data inclusion) and zero-run methods (post hoc evaluation) are often used instead, though their statistical validity remains unclear. To address this gap, we frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in the training set. This novel formulation reveals and formalizes key sources of bias in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations popular for LLMs are confounded by non-random membership assignment. We derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics and propose practical estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees. Experiments on real-world data show that our approach enables reliable memorization measurement even when retraining is impractical and under distribution shift, providing a principled foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Generation via test-time learning with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For the 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorems to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.</description>

      <title>Separation-Utility Pareto Frontier: An Information-Theoretic Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Pareto frontier (optimal trade-off) between utility and separation, a fairness criterion requiring predictive independence from sensitive attributes conditional on the true outcome. Through an information-theoretic lens, we prove a characterization of the utility-separation Pareto frontier, establish its concavity, and thereby prove the increasing marginal cost of separation in terms of utility. In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods. This study thus offers a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Volume Nonnegative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.</description>
