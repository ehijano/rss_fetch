      <title>Dynamic Training-Free Fusion of Subject and Style LoRAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored the combination of multiple LoRAs to simultaneously generate user-specified subjects and styles. However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Symbolic recovery of PDEs from measurement data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) are powerful for describing a wide range of complex relationships in the natural sciences. Accurately identifying the PDE model, which represents the underlying physical law, is essential for a proper understanding of the problem. This reconstruction typically relies on indirect and noisy measurements of the system's state and, without specifically tailored methods, rarely yields symbolic expressions, thereby hindering interpretability. In this work, we address this issue by considering existing neural network architectures based on rational functions for the symbolic representation of physical laws. These networks leverage the approximation power of rational functions while also benefiting from their flexibility in representing arithmetic operations. Our main contribution is an identifiability result, showing that, in the limit of noiseless, complete measurements, such symbolic networks can uniquely reconstruct the simplest physical law within the PDE model. Specifically, reconstructed laws remain expressible within the symbolic network architecture, with regularization-minimizing parameterizations promoting interpretability and sparsity in case of $L^1$-regularization. In addition, we provide regularity results for symbolic networks. Empirical validation using the ParFam architecture supports these theoretical findings, providing evidence for the practical reconstructibility of physical laws.</description>
