      <title>Mean dimension explosion of induced homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $X$ a compact metric space and $T: X \to X$ a continuous map, the induced hyperspace map $T_\mathcal{K}$ acts on the hyperspace $\mathcal{K}(X)$ of closed and nonempty subsets of $X$, and on the continuum hyperspace $\mathcal{C}(X) \subset \mathcal{K}(X)$ of connected sets. This work studies the mean dimension explosion phenomenon: when the base system $T$ has zero topological entropy, but the mean dimension of the induced map $T_\mathcal{K}$ is infinite. In particular, this phenomenon is attained for Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms. Furthermore, for a circle homeomorphism $H$, the mean dimension explosion does not occur if, and only if, $H$ is conjugated to a rotation. Finally, if the topological entropy of $T$ is positive, then the metric mean dimension of $T_\mathcal{K}$ is infinite.</description>

      <title>Amenable graphs and the spectral radius of extensions of Markov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss relations between the amenability of a graph and spectral properties of a random walk driven by a dynamical system. In order to include graphs which are not locally compact, we introduce the concept of amenability of weighted graphs, which generalises the usual notion as the new definition is shown to be equivalent to Foelner's condition. As a first result, we obtain the following generalisation of Kesten's amenability criterion to graphs and non-independent increments: If the random walk is driven by a full-branched Gibbs-Markov map, the graph is amenable with respect to the weight induced by the random walk if and only if the spectral radius of the associated Markov operator is equal to one. By employing inducing schemes, one then obtains criteria for amenability through Markov maps with less regularity. We conclude the paper with the following applications to Schreier graphs. If the random walk is driven by an uniformly expanding map with non-Markovian increments, then, under certain conditions, the Schreier graph is amenable if the probability of a return in time n does not decay exponentially in n. Furthermore, in the context of geometrically finite Kleinian groups, one obtains a version of Brooks's amenability criterion for not necessarily normal subgroups.</description>

      <title>Generic controllability of equivariant systems and applications to particle systems and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist many examples of systems which have some symmetries, and which one may monitor with symmetry preserving controls. Since symmetries are preserved along the evolution, full controllability is not possible, and controllability has to be considered inside sets of states with same symmetries. We prove that generic systems with symmetries are controllable in this sense. This result has several applications, for instance:  (i) generic controllability of particle systems when the kernel of interaction between particles plays the role of a mean-field control;  (ii)  generic controllability for families of vector fields on manifolds with boundary; (iii) universal interpolation for neural networks architectures with "generic" self attention-type layers - a type of layers ubiquitous in recent neural networks architectures, e.g., in the Transformers architecture. The tools we develop could help address various other questions of control of equivariant systems.</description>

      <title>Hopf Bifurcation in Asymmetric Ring Networks: Constraints on Phase Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopf bifurcation in networks of coupled ODEs creates periodic states in which the relative phases of nodes are well defined near bifurcation. When the network is a fully inhomogeneous nearest-neighbour coupled unidirectional ring, and node spaces are 1-dimensional, we derive constraints on these phase shifts that apply to any ODE that respects the ring topology. We begin with a 3-node ring and generalise the results to any number of nodes. The main point is that such constraints exist even when the only structure present is the network topology. We also prove that the usual nondegeneracy conditions in the classical Hopf Bifurcation Theorem are valid generically for ring networks, by perturbing only coupling terms.</description>

      <title>Convergence properties of dynamic mode decomposition for analytic interval maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a data-driven algorithm for approximating spectral data of the Koopman operator associated to a dynamical system, combining a Galerkin method of order N and collocation method of order M. Spectral convergence of this method subtly depends on appropriate choice of the space of observables. For chaotic analytic full branch maps of the interval, we derive a constraint between M and N guaranteeing spectral convergence of EDMD.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Polynomial sumset structures on $\mathbb{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05226v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we searh for monochromatic infinite additive structures involving polynomials on $\mathbb{N}$. Ultimately, we can build the following results: (1) For any $r\in \mathbb{N}$, any distinct natural numbers $a,b$ and any $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exist subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $|B|=r$ and $|C|=\infty$ such that there exists a color containing $B+aC$ and $B+bC$; (2) For any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ and any $P\in \mathbb{Z}[n]$ with positive leading coefficient and zero constant term, there exist infinite subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $P(C)\subset \mathbb{N}$ and $B\subset P(\mathbb{N})$ such that $B+P(C)$ is monochromatic. In fact, for the specific question considered by us, the above results may be the best.</description>

      <title>Towards a representer theorem for identification of passive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major problem in system identification is the incorporation of prior knowledge about the physical properties of the given system, such as stability, positivity and passivity. In this paper, we present first steps towards tackling this problem for passive systems. In particular, using ideas from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we solve the problem of identifying a nonnegative input-output operator from data consisting of input-output trajectories of the system. We prove a representer theorem for this problem in the case where the input space is finite-dimensional. This provides a computationally tractable solution, which we show can be obtained by solving an associated semidefinite program.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hydrodynamics for the Volterra lattice: Ballistic and nonballistic behavior of correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a lot of effort has been put in describing the hydrodynamic behavior of integrable systems. In this paper, we describe such picture for the Volterra lattice. Specifically, we are able to explicitly compute the susceptibility matrix and the current-field correlation matrix in terms of the density of states of the Volterra lattice endowed with a Generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we apply the theory of linear Generalized Hydrodynamics to describe the Euler scale behavior of the correlation functions. We anticipate that the solution to the Generalized Hydrodynamics equations develops shocks at $\xi_0=\frac{x}{t}$; so this linear approximation does not fully describe the behavior of correlation functions. Intrigued but this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior. In view of this empirical observation, we believe that at this point $\xi_0$ the diffusive contribution are not sub-leading corrections to the ballistic transport, but they are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Algebraic rates of stability for front-type modulated waves in Ginzburg Landau equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the stability of front-type modulated waves in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGL). The waves occur in the bistable regime (e.g. of the quintic CGL) and connect the zero state to a spatially homogenous state oscillating in time. For initial perturbations that decay at a certain algebraic rate, we prove convergence to the wave with asymptotic phase. The convergence holds in algebraically weighted Sobolev norms and with an algebraic rate in time, where the asymptotic phase is approached by one order less than the profile. On the technical side we use the theory of exponential trichotomies to separate the spatial modes into growing, weakly decaying, and strongly decaying ones. This allows us to derive resolvent and semigroup estimates in weighted Sobolev norms and to close the argument with a Gronwall lemma involving algebraic weights.</description>

      <title>Gap for geometric canonical height functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a gap around zero for canonical height functions associated to endomorphisms of projective spaces defined over complex function fields. We also prove that if the rational points of height zero are Zariski dense, then the endomorphism is birationally isotrivial. As a corollary, by a result of S. Cantat and J. Xie, we have a geometric Northcott property on projective plane in the same spirit of results of R. Benedetto, M. Baker and L. Demarco on the projective line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that divergent, extended geometrically finite (in the sense of Weisman arXiv:2205.07183) representations can be interpreted as restricted Anosov (in the sense of Tholozan--Wang arXiv:2307.02934) representations over certain flow spaces. We also show that the representations of this type are stable under small type preserving deformations. As an example, we show that a representation induced from a geometrically finite one through a Galois covering, constructed in Tholozan--Wang arXiv:2307.02934, is divergent and extended geometrically finite with a non-homeomorphic boundary extension.</description>

      <title>Sharp systolic inequalities for invariant tight contact forms on principal S1-bundles over S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systole of a contact form $\alpha$ is defined as the shortest period of closed Reeb orbits of $\alpha$. Given a non-trivial $\mathbb S^1$-principal bundle over $\mathbb S^2$ with total space $M$, we prove a sharp systolic inequality for the class of tight contact form on $M$ invariant under the $\mathbb S^1$-action. This inequality exhibits a behavior which depends on the Euler class of the bundle in a subtle way. As applications, we prove a sharp systolic inequality for rotationally symmetric Finsler metrics on $\mathbb S^2$, a systolic inequality for the shortest contractible closed Reeb orbit, and a particular case of a conjecture by Viterbo.</description>
