      <title>Extrapolation for bilinear compact operators in the variable exponent setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish extrapolation of compactness for bilinear operators in the scale of weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces. First, we prove an abstract principle relying on the Cobos--Fern\'{a}ndez--Cabrera--Mart\'{i}nez theorem. Then, as an application we deduce new compactness results for the commutators of bilinear $\omega$-Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund operators and bilinear fractional integrals acting on weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces. Our work extends and unifies among others earlier works of the second named author together with Hyt\"{o}nen as well as Oikari.</description>

      <title>The Kakeya Conjecture: where does it come from and why is it important?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roughly speaking, the Kakeya Conjecture asks to what extent lines which point in different directions can be packed together in a small space. In $\R^2$, the problem is relatively straightforward and was settled in the 1970s. In $\R^3$ it is much more difficult and was only recently resolved in a monumental and groundbreaking work of Hong Wang and Joshua Zahl. This note describes the origins of the Kakeya Conjecture, with a particular focus on its classical connections to Fourier analysis, and concludes with a discussion of elements of the Wang--Zahl proof. The goal is to give a sense of why the problem is considered so central to mathematical analysis, and thereby underscore the importance of the Wang--Zahl result.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics for non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the two-dimensional analogue of the asymptotics for Toeplitz determinants with Fisher-Hartwig singularities, for general real symbols. This formula has applications to random normal matrices with complex spectra: (i) the characteristic polynomial converges to a Gaussian multiplicative chaos random measure on the limiting droplet, in the subcritical phase; (ii) the electric potential converges pointwise to a logarithmically correlated field; (iii) the measure of its level sets (i.e. thick points) is identified; (iv) the associated free energy undergoes a freezing transition.
  This establishes emergence of the Liouville quantum gravity measure from free fermions in 2d, and universality with respect to the external potential.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Search for Differential Equations Corresponding to Optimization Methods and Their Convergence Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuously differentiable convex function with its minimizer denoted by $x_*$ and optimal value $f_* = f(x_*)$. Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies.</description>

      <title>Higher-order asymptotic expansion with error estimate for the multidimensional Laplace-type integral under perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of the multidimensional Laplace-type integral with a perturbed phase function. Under suitable assumptions, we derive a higher-order asymptotic expansion with an error estimate, generalizing some previous results including Laplace's method. The key points of the proof are a precise asymptotic analysis based on a lot of detailed Taylor expansions, and a careful consideration of the effects of the perturbations on the Hessian matrix of the phase function.</description>

      <title>A chronology of continued square roots and other continued compositions, through the year 2016</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.06139v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite continued composition is an expression of the form \begin{equation*} \lim_{n\to\infty}t_0\circ t_1 \circ t_2 \circ \cdots \circ t_n(c)\;, \end{equation*} where the $t_i$ are maps from a set $D$ to itself, the initial value $c$ is a point in $D$, and the order of operations proceeds from right to left.
  This document is a bibliography, in chronological order through the year 2016, of selected continued compositions whose primary sources have typically been obscure. In particular, we include continued square roots: \begin{equation*} a_0+\sqrt{a_1+\sqrt{a_2+\sqrt{\ldots}}}\;, \end{equation*} as well as continued powers, continued cotangents, continued logarithms, and $f$-expansions. However, we do not include continued fractions, continued exponentials, or forms such as infinite sums and products in which the $t_i$ are linear functions, because the literature on these forms is extensive.</description>
