      <title>A car-following model with behavioural adaptation to road geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the effect of road geometry on human driving behaviour is essential for both road safety studies and traffic microsimulation. Research on this topic is still limited, mainly focusing on free-flow traffic and not adequately considering the influence of curvature on car-following dynamics. This work attempts to investigate this issue and model the adaptation of car-following behaviour to horizontal curvature. For this purpose, the maximum desired speed - which mainly determines the free-flow dynamics - is expressed as a parsimonious function of the curvature. A spatial anticipation mechanism is also included in order to realistically describe the driving behaviour when approaching or exiting from curves. The accuracy of the augmented model is evaluated using the Modified Intelligent Driver Model (M-IDM) and trajectory data from free-flow and car-following traffic (Naples data and Zen Traffic Data). The results show that a significant improvement is achieved in free-flow dynamics. In car-following situations, improvements are mainly observed at high speed and are dependent on the observed driver. Overall, the analysis highlights the lack of sufficiently spatially extended trajectory data to calibrate and evaluate such driving behaviours.</description>

      <title>Targeting heuristics for cost-optimized institutional incentives in heterogeneous networked populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world is currently grappling with challenges on both local and global scales, many of which demand coordinated behavioral changes. However, breaking away from the status is often difficult due to deeply ingrained social norms. In such cases, social systems may require seemingly exogenous interventions to set off endogenous, largely irreversible processes that drive change -- social tipping. While studies have looked at targeted interventions, real-life constraints faced by policymakers, like minimizing costs while ensuring a quick and fair transition, remain understudied. To address this complexity, we introduce a game-theoretic framework that accounts for individual heterogeneity and networks of local influence. We implement various heuristics based on information about individual preferences and commonly used local network properties. Results show that where the change is initiated in the population and the direction in which it propagates is essential to the effectiveness of interventions. We identify optimal strategies under different scenarios, such as varying levels of resistance to change, preference heterogeneity, and homophily. These results provide insights that can be experimentally tested and help policymakers to better direct incentives.</description>

      <title>COOL Research DAO Whitepaper -- Towards community-owned astrophysics for everyone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysics forms a cornerstone of human curiosity and has revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. However, conventional academic structures often hinder collaboration, transparency, and discovery. We present COOL Research DAO, a next-generation framework for cosmic origins astrophysics research that uses decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) principles to make astrophysics research globally accessible, economically fair, and intellectually open. COOL Research DAO is designed to address four key systemic problems and their manifestations in traditional academic research: general inaccessibility, hierarchical organisation, unfair economic structures, and inefficient knowledge transfer. We describe how these inefficiencies can be addressed using blockchain-based tools and token systems. By fostering bottom-up governance, open-access knowledge networks, and transparent rewards, COOL Research DAO reshapes economic, organisational, and educational paradigms in astrophysics research. Our approach leverages the data-rich and inherently international nature of astrophysics, ensuring a scalable, collaborative platform that welcomes contributions ranging from computational analyses to public outreach. In doing so, we highlight a path toward realising our vision of a truly open research ecosystem, driven by community ownership, intellectual freedom, and shared fascination with our cosmic origins.</description>

      <title>A model for French voters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of opinion dynamics describe how opinions are shaped in various environments. While these models are able to replicate macroscopical opinion distributions observed in real-world scenarios, their capacity to align with data at the microscopical level remains mostly untested. We evaluate the capacity of the multi-state voter model with zealots to capture individual opinions in a fine-grained Twitter dataset collected during the 2017 French Presidential elections. Our findings reveal a strong correspondence between individual opinion distributions in the equilibrium state of the model and ground-truth political leanings of the users. Additionally, we demonstrate that discord probabilities accurately identify pairs of like-minded users. These results emphasize the validity of the voter model in complex settings, and advocate for further empirical evaluations of opinion dynamics models at the microscopical level.</description>

      <title>Metarecycling in Physics Education in Basic Education within the Context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals through Technological Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of digital technologies in the first quarter of the 21st century has introduced significant transformations in various fields, such as communication, healthcare, and education. However, it has also led to an increase in the use and disposal of electronic devices, resulting in environmental challenges related to Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), also known as e-waste. This phenomenon is observed in schools, where the integration and renewal of equipment have become essential for the development and implementation of new teaching strategies. Based on a technological research project, we present how students from a public school in S\~ao Paulo's countryside conducted e-waste reuse processes, applying the principles of metarecycling and physics knowledge to build a portable battery (power bank) and a smartphone charger powered by a dynamo attached to a bicycle. The appropriation of the relationships between science, technology, and social aspects was facilitated by validating the chargers through characterization tests of the charging time provided by the power bank and the bicycle-installed device under riding conditions. Educational actions within the community, involving concepts of sustainability, clean energy, and health benefits through physical exercise, were guided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</description>

      <title>Encouraging the teaching of science through composting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of environmental education into the school curriculum can be inspiring for students to assimilate scientific concepts and methods presented in the Science subjects in a contextualized and interdisciplinary way. To carry out such integration in the classroom it is important that a link between teacher training courses and practical activities on the subject during the training of the student teachers exist, to provide them conditions for testing hypotheses, pedagogical methodologies and evaluate their feasibility, considering real limitations of the school environment. The Institutional Program of Scholarships for Teaching Initiation (PIBID - Programa Institucional de Bolsas de Inicia\c{c}\~ao \`a Doc\^encia) is a Brazilian government policy developed to improve the training of student teachers which provides an ideal scenario for this. In this work, students from PIBID carried out this proposal through the windrow composting process. This was developed at the school considering the selective separation of waste, the construction of compost bins, the introduction and discussion of scientific concepts and experimentation, by monitoring the process. In addition to the beneficial experience for the training of student teachers, we show that the proposal is promising for developing student's skills such as scientific literacy and protagonism, and also the establishment of a school composting program.</description>

      <title>The Economics of an Open-Source Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source projects that aim to make their offerings public have competed against for-profit, proprietary companies in a number of domains. These open-source projects often arise in response to the offerings of proprietary companies in markets where products have already been commercialized. We assess what impact an open-source project might have when it enters the market for quantum computing - a market where the core technology is still being developed. We argue that an open-source quantum computer might alleviate market frictions that have impeded the development of a fault-tolerant quantum computer by providing the market with a possible mechanism for: 1.) benchmarking, 2.) the development of hardware agnostic technology, and 3.) improved liquidity on the supply side of the market for labor. Should these outcomes be realized, they may not only benefit the open-source project, but also the for-profit, proprietary companies operating in the ecosystem. In this respect, an open-source quantum project may play a more complementary role to the proprietary firms in the ecosystem, rather than a more competitive role. Our collective insights may have implications for other settings where an open-source project enters into a market where the core technology has yet to be commercialized.</description>

      <title>Valuing science and the teaching of Physics through theatrical communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific communication inside and outside the classroom is the main means for providing an adequate understanding of how science and technological innovation relate to society. In order to achieve this goal, it is important to explore new didactic instruments for teaching science in general. The intersection between science and arts has contributed to make science accessible, relevant and interesting to diverse audiences with the potential to provide scientific content, significant artistic and entertainment values. Here, we use theatrical communication to value science and the teaching of Physics through an original script of a play in which concepts and phenomena related to astronomy are addressed. Using an artistic and casual language, we adapt the proposed scientific concepts to the contextual and instrumental nature of theater to demonstrate its educational value and its potential to transform science into entertainment. Our proposal allowed students being engaged in a highly motivating and collaborative environment, providing them the opportunity to recognize, analyze and imagine explanations and performances to communicate science to the general public in a creative and alternative way.</description>
