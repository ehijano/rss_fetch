      <title>In Planta Tattoo and Kirigami Sensors for Self-Powered Monitoring of Vapor Pressure Deficit and Growth Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a scalable, self-powered in planta sensor platform for continuous monitoring of plant hydration and growth. The system integrates two components a leaf mounted tattoo sensor for estimating vapor pressure deficit and a kirigami inspired strain sensor for tracking radial stem growth. Uniquely, the tattoo sensor serves a dual function measuring temperature and humidity beneath the leaf surface while simultaneously harvesting power from ambient moisture via a vanadium pentoxide nanosheet membrane. This moist-electric generator configuration enables energy-autonomous operation, delivering a power density of 0.1114 miroW per square cm. The V2O5 based sensor exhibits high sensitivity to humidity and temperature, enabling accurate VPD estimation for over 10 days until leaf senescence. The eutectogel based kirigami strain sensor, wrapped around the stem, offers a gauge factor of 1.5 and immunity to unrelated mechanical disturbances, allowing continuous growth tracking for more than 20 days. Both sensors are fabricated via cleanroom-free, roll to roll compatible methods, underscoring their potential for large-scale agricultural deployment to monitor abiotic stress and improve crop management.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-derived Cardiotocography Age as a Digital Biomarker for Predicting Future Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiotocography (CTG) is a low-cost, non-invasive fetal health assessment technique used globally, especially in underdeveloped countries. However, it is currently mainly used to identify the fetus's current status (e.g., fetal acidosis or hypoxia), and the potential of CTG in predicting future adverse pregnancy outcomes has not been fully explored. We aim to develop an AI-based model that predicts biological age from CTG time series (named CTGage), then calculate the age gap between CTGage and actual age (named CTGage-gap), and use this gap as a new digital biomarker for future adverse pregnancy outcomes. The CTGage model is developed using 61,140 records from 11,385 pregnant women, collected at Peking University People's Hospital between 2018 and 2022. For model training, a structurally designed 1D convolutional neural network is used, incorporating distribution-aligned augmented regression technology. The CTGage-gap is categorized into five groups: &lt; -21 days (underestimation group), -21 to -7 days, -7 to 7 days (normal group), 7 to 21 days, and &gt; 21 days (overestimation group). We further defined the underestimation group and overestimation group together as the high-risk group. We then compare the incidence of adverse outcomes and maternal diseases across these groups. The average absolute error of the CTGage model is 10.91 days. When comparing the overestimation group with the normal group, premature infants incidence is 5.33% vs. 1.42% (p &lt; 0.05) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) incidence is 31.93% vs. 20.86% (p &lt; 0.05). When comparing the underestimation group with the normal group, low birth weight incidence is 0.17% vs. 0.15% (p &lt; 0.05) and anaemia incidence is 37.51% vs. 34.74% (p &lt; 0.05). Artificial intelligence-derived CTGage can predict the future risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and hold potential as a novel, non-invasive, and easily accessible digital biomarker.</description>

      <title>InWaveSR: Topography-Aware Super-Resolution Network for Internal Solitary Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective utilization of observational data is frequently hindered by insufficient resolution. To address this problem, we present a new spatio-temporal super-resolution (STSR) model, called InWaveSR. It is built on a deep learning framework with physical restrictions and can efficiently generate high-resolution data from low-resolution input, especially for data featuring internal solitary waves (ISWs). To increase generality and interpretation, the model InWaveSR uses the primitive Navier-Stokes equations as the constraint, ensuring that the output results are physically consistent. In addition, the proposed model incorporates an HF-ResBlock component that combines the attention mechanism and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method to improve the performance of the model in capturing high-frequency characteristics. Simultaneously, in order to enhance the adaptability of the model to complicated bottom topography, an edge sampling and numerical pre-processing method are carried out to optimize the training process. On evaluations using the in-situ observational ISW data, the proposed InWaveSR achieved a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) score of 36.2, higher than those of the traditional interpolation method and the previous neural network. This highlights its significant superiority over traditional methods, demonstrating its excellent performance and reliability in high-resolution ISW reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Conditional Nearest Level Modulation for Improved Switching Dynamics in Asymmetric Multilevel Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular multilevel converters have promising applications in clean energy, electric vehicles, and biomedical instrumentation, but need many modules to achieve fine output granularity, particularly of the voltage. Asymmetric multilevel circuits introduce differences in module voltages so that the quantity of output levels grows exponentially with the number of modules. Nearest-level modulation (NLM) is preferred over carrier-based methods in asymmetric circuits for its simplicity. However, the large number of output levels can overwhelm NLM and cause excessive transistor switching on some modules and output voltage spikes. We propose a conditional nearest-level modulation (cNLM) by incorporating mathematical penalty models to regulate switching dynamics. This approach improves output quality and reduces switching rates. Additionally, we present cNLM variations tailored for specific functions, such as enforcing a minimum switching interval. Experimental validation on an asymmetric multilevel prototype demonstrates that cNLM reduces the total output distortion from 66.3% to 15.1% while cutting the switching rate to just 8% of the original NLM.</description>

      <title>Indoor Airflow Imaging Using Physics-Informed Background-Oriented Schlieren Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for non-invasive volumetric indoor airflow estimation from a single viewpoint using background-oriented schlieren (BOS) measurements and physics-informed reconstruction. Our framework utilizes a light projector that projects a pattern onto a target back-wall and a camera that observes small distortions in the light pattern. While the single-view BOS tomography problem is severely ill-posed, our proposed framework addresses this using: (1) improved ray tracing, (2) a physics-based light rendering approach and loss formulation, and (3) a physics-based regularization using a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to ensure that the reconstructed airflow is consistent with the governing equations for buoyancy-driven flows.</description>

      <title>Biologically Plausible Online Hebbian Meta-Learning: Two-Timescale Local Rules for Spiking Neural Brain Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces face challenges from neural signal instability and memory constraints for real-time implantable applications. We introduce an online SNN decoder using local three-factor learning rules with dual-timescale eligibility traces that avoid backpropagation through time while maintaining competitive performance. Our approach combines error-modulated Hebbian updates, fast/slow trace consolidation, and adaptive learning rate control, requiring only O(1) memory versus O(T) for BPTT methods. Evaluations on two primate datasets achieve comparable decoding accuracy (Pearson $R \geq 0.63$ Zenodo, $R \geq 0.81$ MC Maze) with 28-35% memory reduction and faster convergence than BPTT-trained SNNs. Closed-loop simulations with synthetic neural populations demonstrate adaptation to neural disruptions and learning from scratch without offline calibration. This work enables memory-efficient, continuously adaptive neural decoding suitable for resource-constrained implantable BCI systems.</description>

      <title>Secure Blind Graph Signal Recovery and Adversary Detection Using Smoothness Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a secure blind Graph Signal Recovery (GSR) algorithm that can detect adversary nodes. Some unknown adversaries are assumed to be injecting false data at their respective nodes in the graph. The number and location of adversaries are not known in advance and the goal is to recover the graph signal in the presence of measurement noise and False Data Injection (FDI) caused by the adversaries. Consequently, the proposed algorithm would be a perfect candidate to solve this challenging problem. Moreover, due to the presence of malicious nodes, the proposed method serves as a secure GSR algorithm. For adversary detection, a statistical measure based on differential smoothness is used. Specifically, the difference between the current observed smoothness and the average smoothness excluding the corresponding node. This genuine statistical approach leads to an effective and low-complexity adversary detector. In addition, following malicious node detection, the GSR is performed using a variant of smoothness maximization, which is solved efficiently as a fractional optimization problem using a Dinkelbach's algorithm. Analysis of the detector, which determines the optimum threshold of the detector is also presented. Simulation results show a significant improvement of the proposed method in signal recovery compared to the median GSR algorithm and other competing methods.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Aided Intelligent Grant-Free Massive Access for Heterogeneous mMTC Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the arrival of 6G, the Internet of Things (IoT) traffic is becoming more and more complex and diverse. To meet the diverse service requirements of IoT devices, massive machine-type communications (mMTC) becomes a typical scenario, and more recently, grant-free random access (GF-RA) presents a promising direction due to its low signaling overhead. However, existing GF-RA research primarily focuses on improving the accuracy of user detection and data recovery, without considering the heterogeneity of traffic. In this paper, we investigate a non-orthogonal GF-RA scenario where two distinct types of traffic coexist: event-triggered traffic with alarm devices (ADs), and status update traffic with monitor devices (MDs). The goal is to simultaneously achieve high detection success rates for ADs and high information timeliness for MDs. First, we analyze the age-based random access scheme and optimize the access parameters to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of MDs. Then, we design an age-based prior information aided autoencoder (A-PIAAE) to jointly detect active devices, together with learned pilots used in GF-RA to reduce interference between non-orthogonal pilots. In the decoder, an Age-based Learned Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA-AGE) utilizing the AoI of MDs as the prior information is proposed to enhance active user detection. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the proposed A-PIAAE has better convergence performance. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in reducing the average AoI of MDs and improving the successful detection rate of ADs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed deep learning architecture for predicting radio maps over lunar terrain. Our approach integrates a physics-based lunar terrain generator, which produces realistic topography informed by publicly available NASA data, with a ray-tracing engine to create a high-fidelity dataset of radio propagation scenarios. Building on this dataset, we introduce a triplet-UNet architecture, consisting of two standard UNets and a diffusion network, to model complex propagation effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deep learning approaches on our terrain dataset across various metrics.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Learning for Automatic EEG Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods typically depend on manual intervention or clean reference signals. This work introduces a task-oriented learning framework for automatic EEG denoising that uses only task labels without clean reference signals. EEG recordings are first decomposed into components based on blind source separation (BSS) techniques. Then, a learning-based selector assigns a retention probability to each component, and the denoised signal is reconstructed as a probability-weighted combination. A downstream proxy-task model evaluates the reconstructed signal, with its task loss supervising the selector in a collaborative optimization scheme that relies solely on task labels, eliminating the need for clean EEG references. Experiments on three datasets spanning two paradigms and multiple noise conditions show consistent gains in both task performance (accuracy: $2.56\%\uparrow$) and standard signal-quality metrics (signal-to-noise-ratio: $0.82$\,dB\,$\uparrow$). Further analyses demonstrate that the task-oriented learning framework is algorithm-agnostic, as it accommodates diverse decomposition techniques and network backbones for both the selector and the proxy model. These promising results indicate that the proposed task-oriented learning framework is a practical EEG denoising solution with potential implications for neuroscience research and EEG-based interaction systems.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Impact of Location Uncertainty on Radio Map-Based Predictive Rate Selection via Noisy-Input Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a predictive rate-selection framework based on Gaussian process (GP)-based radio map construction that is robust to location uncertainty. Radio maps are a promising tool for improving communication efficiency in 6G networks. Although they enable the design of location-based maximum transmission rates by exploiting statistical channel information, existing discussions often assume perfect (i.e., noiseless) location information during channel sensing. Since such information must be obtained from positioning systems such as global navigation satellite systems, it inevitably involves positioning errors; this location uncertainty can degrade the reliability of radio map-based wireless systems. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the noisy-input GP (NIGP), which treats location noise as additional output noise by applying a Taylor approximation of the function of interest. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NIGP-based design achieves more reliable transmission-rate selection than pure GP and yields higher throughput than path loss-based rate selection.</description>

      <title>LLM4MG: Adapting Large Language Model for Multipath Generation via Synesthesia of Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), a large language model (LLM) is adapted for multipath generation (LLM4MG) for the first time. Considering a typical sixth-generation (6G) vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenario, a new multi-modal sensing-communication dataset is constructed, named SynthSoM-V2I, including channel multipath information, millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensory data, RGB-D images, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. Based on the SynthSoM-V2I dataset, the proposed LLM4MG leverages Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3.2 for multipath generation via multi-modal sensory data. The proposed LLM4MG aligns the multi-modal feature space with the LLaMA semantic space through feature extraction and fusion networks. To further achieve general knowledge transfer from the pre-trained LLaMA for multipath generation via multi-modal sensory data, the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning and propagation-aware prompt engineering are exploited. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LLM4MG outperforms conventional deep learning-based methods in terms of line-of-sight (LoS)/non-LoS (NLoS) classification with accuracy of 92.76%, multipath power/delay generation precision with normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.099/0.032, and cross-vehicular traffic density (VTD), cross-band, and cross-scenario generalization. The utility of the proposed LLM4MG is validated by real-world generalization. The necessity of high-precision multipath generation for system design is also demonstrated by channel capacity comparison.</description>

      <title>Efficient Solutions for Mitigating Initialization Bias in Unsupervised Self-Adaptive Auditory Attention Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding the attended speaker in a multi-speaker environment from electroencephalography (EEG) has attracted growing interest in recent years, with neuro-steered hearing devices as a driver application. Current approaches typically rely on ground-truth labels of the attended speaker during training, necessitating calibration sessions for each user and each EEG set-up to achieve optimal performance. While unsupervised self-adaptive auditory attention decoding (AAD) for stimulus reconstruction has been developed to eliminate the need for labeled data, it suffers from an initialization bias that can compromise performance. Although an unbiased variant has been proposed to address this limitation, it introduces substantial computational complexity that scales with data size. This paper presents three computationally efficient alternatives that achieve comparable performance, but with a significantly lower and constant computational cost. The code for the proposed algorithms is available at https://github.com/YYao-42/Unsupervised_AAD.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance Analysis of Different Hybrid NOMA Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (H-NOMA), which combines the advantages of pure NOMA and conventional OMA organically, has emerged as a highly promising multiple access technology for future wireless networks. Recent studies have proposed various H-NOMA systems by employing different successive interference cancellation (SIC) methods for the NOMA transmission phase. However, existing analyses typically assume a fixed channel gain order between paired users, despite the fact that channel coefficients follow random distribution, leading to their magnitude relationships inherently stochastic and time varying. This paper analyzes the performance of three H-NOMA schemes under stochastic channel gain ordering: a) fixed order SIC (FSIC) aided H-NOMA scheme; b) hybrid SIC with non-power adaptation (HSIC-NPA) aided H-NOMA scheme; c) hybrid SIC with power adaptation (HSIC-PA) aided H-NOMA scheme. Theoretical analysis derives closed-form expressions for the probability that H-NOMA schemes underperform conventional OMA. Asymptotic results in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are also developed. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate the performance of H-NOMA schemes across different SNR scenarios, providing a theoretical foundation for the deployment of H-NOMA in next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Sampling Method for Generalized Graph Signals with Pre-selected Vertices via DC Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for vertex-wise flexible sampling of a broad class of graph signals, designed to attain the best possible recovery based on the generalized sampling theory. This is achieved by designing a sampling operator by an optimization problem, which is inherently non-convex, as the best possible recovery imposes a rank constraint. An existing method for vertex-wise flexible sampling is able to control the number of active vertices but cannot incorporate prior knowledge of mandatory or forbidden vertices. To address these challenges, we formulate the operator design as a problem that handles a constraint of the number of active vertices and prior knowledge on specific vertices for sampling, mandatory inclusion or exclusion. We transformed this constrained problem into a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization problem by using the nuclear norm and a DC penalty for vertex selection. To solve this, we develop a convergent solver based on the general double-proximal gradient DC algorithm. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experiments on various graph signal models, including real-world data, showing superior performance in the recovery accuracy by comparing to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Table-Assisted and RL-Based Dynamic Routing for NGSO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates dynamic routing in Next-Generation Satellite Orbit (NGSO) constellations and proposes a hybrid strategy that combines precomputed routing tables with a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) fallback mechanism. While fully RL-based schemes offer adaptability to topology dynamics, they often suffer from high complexity, long convergence times, and unstable performance under heavy traffic. In contrast, the proposed framework exploits deterministic table lookups under nominal conditions and selectively activates the DQL agent only when links become unavailable or congested. Simulation results in large-scale NGSO networks show that the hybrid approach consistently achieves higher packet delivery ratio, lower end-to-end delay, shorter average hop count, and improved throughput compared to a pure RL baseline. These findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid routing as a scalable and resilient solution for delay-sensitive satellite broadband services</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Time-Index Powered Weighted Sums Using Cascaded Accumulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a novel approach for \mbox{efficiently} computing time-index powered weighted sums of the form $\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} n^{K} v[n]$ using cascaded accumulators. Traditional direct computation requires $K{\times}N$ general multiplications, which become prohibitive for large $N$, while alternative strategies based on lookup tables or signal reversal require storing entire data blocks. By exploiting accumulator properties, the proposed method eliminates the need for such storage and reduces the multiplicative cost to only $K{+}1$ constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time implementation. The approach is particularly useful when such sums need to be efficiently computed in sample-by-sample processing systems.</description>

      <title>Doppler Radiance Field-Guided Antenna Selection for Improved Generalization in Multi-Antenna Wi-Fi-based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the IEEE 802.11bf Task Group introducing amendments to the WLAN standard for advanced sensing, interest in using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for remote sensing has surged. Recent findings indicate that learning a unified three-dimensional motion representation through Doppler Radiance Fields (DoRFs) derived from CSI significantly improves the generalization capabilities of Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR). Despite this progress, CSI signals remain affected by asynchronous access point (AP) clocks and additive noise from environmental and hardware sources. Consequently, even with existing preprocessing techniques, both the CSI data and Doppler velocity projections used in DoRFs are still susceptible to noise and outliers, limiting HAR performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for multi-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas based on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler velocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand gesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided Wi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability, paving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments.</description>

      <title>A Unified Distributed Algorithm for Hybrid Near-Far Field Activity Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A great amount of endeavor has recently been devoted to activity detection for massive machine-type communications in cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, as the number of antennas at the access points (APs) increases, the Rayleigh distance that separates the near-field and far-field regions also expands, rendering the conventional assumption of far-field propagation alone impractical. To address this challenge, this paper establishes a covariance-based formulation that can effectively capture the statistical property of hybrid near-far field channels. Based on this formulation, we theoretically reveal that increasing the proportion of near-field channels enhances the detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a distributed algorithm, where each AP performs local activity detection and only exchanges the detection results to the central processing unit, thus significantly reducing the computational complexity and the communication overhead. Not only with convergence guarantee, the proposed algorithm is unified in the sense that it can handle single-cell or cell-free systems with either near-field or far-field devices as special cases. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Chameleon: Integrated Sensing and Communication with Sub-Symbol Beam Switching in mmWave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation cellular networks are envisioned to integrate sensing capabilities with communication, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, where beamforming using large-scale antenna arrays enables directional signal transmissions for improved spatial multiplexing. In current 5G networks, however, beamforming is typically designed either for communication or sensing (e.g., beam training during link establishment). In this paper, we present Chameleon, a novel framework that augments and rapidly switches beamformers during each demodulation reference signal (DMRS) symbol to achieve integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 5G mmWave networks. Each beamformer introduces an additional sensing beam toward target angles while maintaining the communication beams toward multiple users. We implement Chameleon on a 28 GHz software-defined radio testbed supporting over-the-air 5G physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) transmissions. Extensive experiments in open environments show that Chameleon achieves multi-user communication with a sum data rate of up to 0.80 Gbps across two users. Simultaneously, Chameleon employs a beamformer switching interval of only 0.24 {\mu}s, therefore producing a 31x31-point 2D imaging within just 0.875 ms. Leveraging machine learning, Chameleon further enables object localization with median errors of 0.14 m (distance) and 0.24{\deg} (angle), and material classification with 99.0% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Intra-Speaker Variability in Diarization with Style-Controllable Speech Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker diarization systems often struggle with high intrinsic intra-speaker variability, such as shifts in emotion, health, or content. This can cause segments from the same speaker to be misclassified as different individuals, for example, when one raises their voice or speaks faster during conversation. To address this, we propose a style-controllable speech generation model that augments speech across diverse styles while preserving the target speaker's identity. The proposed system starts with diarized segments from a conventional diarizer. For each diarized segment, it generates augmented speech samples enriched with phonetic and stylistic diversity. And then, speaker embeddings from both the original and generated audio are blended to enhance the system's robustness in grouping segments with high intrinsic intra-speaker variability. We validate our approach on a simulated emotional speech dataset and the truncated AMI dataset, demonstrating significant improvements, with error rate reductions of 49% and 35% on each dataset, respectively.</description>

      <title>How Does Instrumental Music Help SingFake Detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although many models exist to detect singing voice deepfakes (SingFake), how these models operate, particularly with instrumental accompaniment, is unclear. We investigate how instrumental music affects SingFake detection from two perspectives. To investigate the behavioral effect, we test different backbones, unpaired instrumental tracks, and frequency subbands. To analyze the representational effect, we probe how fine-tuning alters encoders' speech and music capabilities. Our results show that instrumental accompaniment acts mainly as data augmentation rather than providing intrinsic cues (e.g., rhythm or harmony). Furthermore, fine-tuning increases reliance on shallow speaker features while reducing sensitivity to content, paralinguistic, and semantic information. These insights clarify how models exploit vocal versus instrumental cues and can inform the design of more interpretable and robust SingFake detection systems.</description>

      <title>SpeechMLC: Speech Multi-label Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-label classification framework to detect multiple speaking styles in a speech sample. Unlike previous studies that have primarily focused on identifying a single target style, our framework effectively captures various speaker characteristics within a unified structure, making it suitable for generalized human-computer interaction applications. The proposed framework integrates cross-attention mechanisms within a transformer decoder to extract salient features associated with each target label from the input speech. To mitigate the data imbalance inherent in multi-label speech datasets, we employ a data augmentation technique based on a speech generation model. We validate our model's effectiveness through multiple objective evaluations on seen and unseen corpora. In addition, we provide an analysis of the influence of human perception on classification accuracy by considering the impact of human labeling agreement on model performance.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Simulation Framework for Multi-channel Replay Speech Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replay speech attacks pose a significant threat to voice-controlled systems, especially in smart environments where voice assistants are widely deployed. While multi-channel audio offers spatial cues that can enhance replay detection robustness, existing datasets and methods predominantly rely on single-channel recordings. In this work, we introduce an acoustic simulation framework designed to simulate multi-channel replay speech configurations using publicly available resources. Our setup models both genuine and spoofed speech across varied environments, including realistic microphone and loudspeaker impulse responses, room acoustics, and noise conditions. The framework employs measured loudspeaker directionalities during the replay attack to improve the realism of the simulation. We define two spoofing settings, which simulate whether a reverberant or an anechoic speech is used in the replay scenario, and evaluate the impact of omnidirectional and diffuse noise on detection performance. Using the state-of-the-art M-ALRAD model for replay speech detection, we demonstrate that synthetic data can support the generalization capabilities of the detector across unseen enclosures.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Hybrid Reinforcement Learning via Information Gain Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization (MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive step-size rule for decentralized optimization. Choosing a step-size that balances convergence and stability is challenging. This is amplified in the decentralized setting as agents observe only local (possibly stochastic) gradients and global information (like smoothness) is unavailable. We derive a step-size rule from first principles. The resulting formulation reduces to the well-known Polyak's rule in the single-agent setting, and is suitable for use with stochastic gradients. The method is parameter free, apart from requiring the optimal objective value, which is readily available in many applications. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the performance is comparable to the optimally fine-tuned step-size.</description>

      <title>Learning Graph from Smooth Signals under Partial Observation: A Robustness Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the graph underlying a networked system from nodal signals is crucial to downstream tasks in graph signal processing and machine learning. The presence of hidden nodes whose signals are not observable might corrupt the estimated graph. While existing works proposed various robustifications of vanilla graph learning objectives by explicitly accounting for the presence of these hidden nodes, a robustness analysis of "naive", hidden-node agnostic approaches is still underexplored. This work demonstrates that vanilla graph topology learning methods are implicitly robust to partial observations of low-pass filtered graph signals. We achieve this theoretical result through extending the restricted isometry property (RIP) to the Dirichlet energy function used in graph learning objectives. We show that smoothness-based graph learning formulation (e.g., the GL-SigRep method) on partial observations can recover the ground truth graph topology corresponding to the observed nodes. Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate our findings.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Sensing: CRB Scaling Laws over Time and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new wireless sensing system utilizing a movable antenna (MA) that continuously moves and receives sensing signals to enhance sensing performance over the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) sensing. We show that the angle estimation performance is fundamentally determined by the MA trajectory, and derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the trajectory for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) antenna movement. For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB is derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with sensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with sensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the space-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes. To this end, we design an efficient alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the MA's horizontal or vertical coordinates with the other being fixed, yielding a locally optimal trajectory. Numerical results show that the proposed 1D/2D MA-based sensing schemes significantly reduce both the CRB and actual AoA estimation MSE compared to conventional FPA-based sensing with uniform linear/planar arrays (ULAs/UPAs) as well as various benchmark MA trajectories. Moreover, it is revealed that the steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA trajectories have low correlation in the angular domain, thereby effectively increasing the angular resolution for achieving higher AoA estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Mitigating data replication in text-to-audio generative diffusion models through anti-memorization guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in generative audio models is data replication, where the model unintentionally generates parts of its training data during inference. In this work, we address this issue in text-to-audio diffusion models by exploring the use of anti-memorization strategies. We adopt Anti-Memorization Guidance (AMG), a technique that modifies the sampling process of pre-trained diffusion models to discourage memorization. Our study explores three types of guidance within AMG, each designed to reduce replication while preserving generation quality. We use Stable Audio Open as our backbone, leveraging its fully open-source architecture and training dataset. Our comprehensive experimental analysis suggests that AMG significantly mitigates memorization in diffusion-based text-to-audio generation without compromising audio fidelity or semantic alignment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of Mel vocoding, i.e., the inversion of a Mel magnitude spectrogram to an audio waveform, is still a key component in many text-to-speech (TTS) systems today. Based on generative flow matching, our prior work on generative STFT phase retrieval (DiffPhase), and the pseudoinverse operator of the Mel filterbank, we develop MelFlow, a streaming-capable generative Mel vocoder for speech sampled at 16 kHz with an algorithmic latency of only 32 ms and a total latency of 48 ms. We show real-time streaming capability at this latency not only in theory, but in practice on a consumer laptop GPU. Furthermore, we show that our model achieves substantially better PESQ and SI-SDR values compared to well-established not streaming-capable baselines for Mel vocoding including HiFi-GAN.</description>

      <title>Watermarking and Anomaly Detection in Machine Learning Models for LORA RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) distinguishes wireless devices by the small variations in their analog circuits, avoiding heavy cryptographic authentication. While deep learning on spectrograms improves accuracy, models remain vulnerable to copying, tampering, and evasion. We present a stronger RFFI system combining watermarking for ownership proof and anomaly detection for spotting suspicious inputs. Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler (KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries. On the LoRa dataset, our system achieves 94.6% accuracy, 98% watermark success, and 0.94 AUROC, offering verifiable, tamper-resistant authentication.</description>

      <title>Version Age of Information with Contact Mobility in Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric, defined as the difference between the version of information available at a given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average version age in the network.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Memoryless Linearizer for Analog-to-Digital Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a low-complexity memoryless linearizer for suppression of distortion in analog-to-digital interfaces. It is inspired by neural networks, but has a substantially lower complexity than the neural-network schemes that have appeared earlier in the literature in this context. The paper demonstrates that the proposed linearizer can outperform the conventional parallel memoryless Hammerstein linearizer even when the nonlinearities have been generated through a memoryless polynomial model. Further, a design procedure is proposed in which the linearizer parameters are obtained through matrix inversion. Thereby, the costly and time consuming numerical optimization that is traditionally used when training neural networks is eliminated. Moreover, the design and evaluation incorporate a large set of multi-tone signals covering the first Nyquist band. Simulations show signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) improvements of some 25 dB for multi-tone signals that correspond to the quadrature parts of OFDM signals with QPSK modulation.</description>

      <title>Order Estimation of Linear-Phase FIR Filters for DAC Equalization in Multiple Nyquist Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter considers the design of linear-phase finite-length impulse response (FIR) filters for equalization of the frequency responses of digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The letter derives estimates for the filter orders required, as functions of the bandwidth and equalization accuracy, for four DAC pulses that are used in DACs in multiple Nyquist bands. The estimates are derived through a large set of minimax-optimal equalizers and the use of symbolic regression followed by minimax-optimal curve fitting for further enhancement. Design examples included demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed estimates. In addition, the letter discusses the appropriateness of the four types of linear-phase FIR filters, for the different equalizer cases, as well as the corresponding properties of the equalized systems.</description>

      <title>Digital Linearizer Based on 1-Bit Quantizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel low-complexity memoryless linearizer for suppression of distortion in analog frontends. It is based on our recently introduced linearizer which is inspired by neural networks, but with orders-of-magnitude lower complexity than conventional neural-networks considered in this context, and it can also outperform the conventional parallel memoryless Hammerstein linearizer. Further, it can be designed through matrix inversion and thereby the costly and time consuming numerical optimization traditionally used when training neural networks is avoided. The linearizer proposed in this paper is different in that it uses 1-bit quantizations as nonlinear activation functions and different bias values. These features enable a look-up table implementation which eliminates all but one of the multiplications and additions required for the linearization. Extensive simulations and comparisons are included in the paper, for distorted multi-tone signals and bandpass filtered white noise, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed linearizer.</description>

      <title>Joint Sampling Frequency Offset Estimation and Compensation Based on the Farrow Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sampling frequency offset (SFO) estimation method based on the Farrow structure, which is typically utilized for the SFO compensation and thereby enables a reduction of the implementation complexity of the SFO estimation. The proposed method is implemented in the time domain and works for arbitrary bandlimited signals, thus with no additional constraints on the waveform structure. Moreover, it can operate on only the real or imaginary part of a complex signal, which further reduces the estimation complexity. Furthermore, the proposed method can simultaneously estimate the SFO and additional sampling time offset (STO) and it is insensitive to other synchronization errors, like carrier frequency offset. Both the derivations of the proposed method and its implementation are presented, and through simulation examples, it is demonstrated that it can accurately estimate both SFO and STO for different types of bandlimited signals.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Adaptive Impedance Matching Method Robust to Parasitic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive impedance matching between antennas and radio frequency front-end (RFFE) power modules is essential for mobile communication systems. To address the matching performance degradation caused by parasitic effects in practical tunable matching networks (TMNs), this paper proposes a data-driven adaptive impedance matching method that avoids physical adjustment. First, we propose the residual enhanced circuit behavior modeling network (RECBM-Net), a deep learning model that maps TMN operating states to their scattering parameters (S-parameters). Then, we formulate the matching process based on the trained surrogate model as a mathematical optimization problem. We employ two classic numerical methods with different online computational overhead, namely simulated annealing particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) and adaptive moment estimation with automatic differentiation (AD-Adam), to search for the matching solution. To further reduce the online inference overhead caused by repeated forward propagation through RECBM-Net, we train an inverse mapping solver network (IMS-Net) to directly predict the optimal solution. Simulation results show that RECBM-Net accurately predicts S-parameters, achieving a mean absolute error of $6.98 \times 10^{-5}$. Across 9000 mismatched scenarios, the compliance rate after tuning increases from 0.97% with the analytical solution of the ideal L-network to 95.92% with SAPSO, 93.42% with AD-Adam, and 95% with IMS-Net. While AD-Adam significantly reduces computational overhead, lowering the average number of RECBM-Net inferences from 2097 with SAPSO to 285, it sacrifices some accuracy. IMS-Net requires only a single inference to obtain the matching solution, resulting in minimal online overhead while maintaining excellent matching accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a mean for trajectories and multi-object trajectories (defined as sets or multi-sets of trajectories) along with algorithms for computing them. Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Spatial Attention Network for Near-field MIMO Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large-scale array (ELAA) brings higher spectral efficiency and spatial degree of freedom, but triggers issues on near-field channel estimation.
  Existing near-field channel estimation schemes primarily exploit sparsity in the transform domain.
  However, these schemes are sensitive to the transform matrix selection and the stopping criteria.
  Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in far-field channel estimation, this paper proposes a novel spatial-attention-based method for reconstructing extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) channel.
  Initially, the spatial antenna correlations of near-field channels are analyzed as an expectation over the angle-distance space, which demonstrate correlation range of an antenna element varies with its position.
  Due to the strong correlation between adjacent antenna elements, interactions of inter-subchannel are applied to describe inherent correlation of near-field channels instead of inter-element.
  Subsequently, a multi-scale spatial attention network (MsSAN) with the inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities is proposed tailed to near-field MIMO channel estimation.
  We employ the multi-scale architecture to refine the subchannel size in MsSAN.
  Specially, we inventively introduce the sum of dot products as spatial attention (SA) instead of cross-covariance to weight subchannel features at different scales in the SA module.
  Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed MsSAN achieves remarkable the inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities and outperforms others in terms of near-field channel reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Object Tracking Incorporating Transfer Learning into Unscented and Cubature Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel filtering algorithm that employs Bayesian transfer learning to address the challenges posed by mismatched intensity of the noise in a pair of sensors, each of which tracks an object using a nonlinear dynamic system model. In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</description>

      <title>AR-KAN: Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks struggle to capture the spectral structure of complex signals. Fourier neural networks (FNNs) attempt to address this by embedding Fourier series components, yet many real-world signals are almost-periodic with non-commensurate frequencies, posing additional challenges. Building on prior work showing that ARIMA outperforms large language models (LLMs) for forecasting, we extend the comparison to neural predictors and find ARIMA still superior. We therefore propose the Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AR-KAN), which integrates a pre-trained AR module for temporal memory with a KAN for nonlinear representation. The AR module preserves essential temporal features while reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that AR-KAN matches ARIMA on almost-periodic functions and achieves the best results on $72\%$ of Rdatasets series, with a clear advantage on data with periodic structure. These results highlight AR-KAN as a robust and effective framework for time series forecasting.</description>
