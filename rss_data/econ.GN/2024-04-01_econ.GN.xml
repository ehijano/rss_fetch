      <title>Using Images as Covariates: Measuring Curb Appeal with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper details an innovative methodology to integrate image data into traditional econometric models. Motivated by forecasting sales prices for residential real estate, we harness the power of deep learning to add "information" contained in images as covariates. Specifically, images of homes were categorized and encoded using an ensemble of image classifiers (ResNet-50, VGG16, MobileNet, and Inception V3). Unique features presented within each image were further encoded through panoptic segmentation. Forecasts from a neural network trained on the encoded data results in improved out-of-sample predictive power. We also combine these image-based forecasts with standard hedonic real estate property and location characteristics, resulting in a unified dataset. We show that image-based forecasts increase the accuracy of hedonic forecasts when encoded features are regarded as additional covariates. We also attempt to "explain" which covariates the image-based forecasts are most highly correlated with. The study exemplifies the benefits of interdisciplinary methodologies, merging machine learning and econometrics to harness untapped data sources for more accurate forecasting.</description>

      <title>Variability in Aggregate Personal Income Across Industrial Sectors During COVID-19 Shock: A Time-Series Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explored the variability in Aggregate Personal Income (PI) across 13 major industrial sectors in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing time-series data from 2010 Q1 to 2019 Q4, we employed Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to establish baseline trends in Personal Income (PI) before the pandemic. We then extended these models to forecast PI values for the subsequent 14 quarters, from 2020 Q1 to 2023 Q2, as if the pandemic had never happened. This forecasted data was compared with the actual PI data collected during the pandemic to quantify its impacts. This approach allowed for the assessment of both immediate and extended effects of COVID-19 on sector-specific PI. Our study highlighted the resilience of PI in sectors like Utilities, Retail, Finance, Real Estate, and Healthcare, with Farming showing an early recovery in PI, despite significant initial setbacks. In contrast, PI in Accommodation and Food Services experienced delayed recovery, contributing significantly to the overall impact variance alongside Farming (53.26\% and 33.26\% respectively). Finance and Utilities demonstrated positive deviations, suggesting a lesser impact or potential benefit in early pandemic stages. Meanwhile, sectoral PI in Manufacturing, Wholesale and Education showed moderate recovery, whereas Construction and Government lagged in resilience. The aggregate economic impact, initially negative at -0.027 in 2020 Q1, drastically worsened to -1.42 in Q2, but improved by Q4, reflecting a broader trend of adaptation and resilience across all the sectors during the pandemic.</description>

      <title>Predicting the impact of e-commerce indices on international trade in Iran and other selected members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) by using the artificial intelligence and P-VAR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims at predicting the impact of e-commerce indicators on international trade of the selected OECD countries and Iran, by using the artificial intelligence approach and P-VAR. According to the nature of export, import, GDP, and ICT functions, and the characteristics of nonlinearity, this analysis is performed by using the MPL neural network. The export, import, GDP, and ICT findings were examined with 99 percent accuracy. Using the P-VAR model in the Eviews software, the initial database and predicted data were applied to estimate the impact of e-commerce on international trade. The findings from analyzing the data show that there is a bilateral correlation between e-commerce which means that ICT and international trade affect each other and the Goodness of fit of the studied model is confirmed.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation with high-dimensional data in public policy evaluation -- an application to the conditioning of cash transfers in Morocco using causal machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal machine learning methods can be used to search for treatment effect heterogeneity in high-dimensional datasets even where we lack a strong enough theoretical framework to select variables or make parametric assumptions about data. This paper uses causal machine learning methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in the case of an experimental study carried out in Morocco which evaluated the effect of conditionalizing a cash transfer program on several outcomes including maths test scores which is the focus of this work. We explore treatment effects across a dataset of 1936 pre-treatment variables. For the most part, heterogeneity is modelled by two different factors, participation in education (at the baseline) and more general measures of poverty. Those who are more disadvantaged at the baseline benefit less from any treatment. While conditioning generally has a negative effect this more disadvantaged group is also hurt more by conditioning. The second purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and reflect upon a causal machine learning approach to policy evaluation. We propose a novel causal tree method for interpretable modelling of causal effects and reflect on the difficulty of explaining atheoretical results.</description>
