      <title>Spin-dependent $\pi$$\pi^{\ast}$ gap in graphene on a magnetic substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the electronic properties of graphene/Eu/Ni(111). By using angle and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we show that the Eu-intercalation of graphene/Ni(111) restores the nearly freestanding dispersion of the $\pi\pi^\ast$ Dirac cones at the K point with an additional lifting of the spin degeneracy due to the mixing of graphene and Eu states. The interaction with the magnetic substrate results in a large spin-dependent gap in the Dirac cones with a topological nature characterized by a large Berry curvature, and a spin-polarized van Hove singularity, whose closeness to the Fermi level gives rise to a polaronic band.</description>

      <title>A Universal Kinematical Group for Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1968, Dashen and Sharp obtained a certain singular Lie algebra of local densities and currents from canonical commutation relations in nonrelativistic quantum field theory. The corresponding Lie group is infinite dimensional: the natural semidirect product of an additive group of scalar functions with a group of diffeomorphisms. Unitary representations of this group describe a wide variety of quantum systems, and have predicted previously unsuspected possibilities; notably, anyons and nonabelian anyons in two space dimensions. We present here foundational reasons why this semidirect product group serves as a universal kinematical group for quantum mechanics. We obtain thus a unified account of all possible quantum kinematics for systems with mass in an arbitrary physical space, and clarify the role played by topology in quantum mechanics. Our development does not require quantization of classical phase space; rather, the classical limit follows from the quantum mechanics. We also consider the relationship of our development to Heisenberg quantization.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Spin and Orbital Hall Phenomena in Antiferromagnetic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous spin and orbital Hall phenomena in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials via orbital pumping experiments. Conducting spin and orbital pumping experiments on YIG/Pt/Ir20Mn80 heterostructures, we unexpectedly observe strong spin and orbital anomalous signals in an out-of-plane configuration. We report a sevenfold increase in the signal of the anomalous inverse orbital Hall effect (AIOHE) compared to conventional effects. Our study suggests expanding the Orbital Hall angle ({\theta}_OH) to a rank 3 tensor, akin to the Spin Hall angle ({\theta}_SH), to explain AIOHE. This work pioneers converting spin-orbital currents into charge current, advancing the spin-orbitronics domain in AF materials.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Two-component density functional theory study of quantized muons in solids"</title>

Abstract: In [Phys. Rev. B 107, 094433 (2023)], Deng et al. have proposed an electron-muon correlation functional within the context of the two-component density functional theory (TC-DFT) for crystals/molecules containing positively charged muons. In order to verify its performance, we applied the functional in conjunction with the B3LYP, as a hybrid electronic exchange-correlation functional, to a benchmark set of molecules. The results demonstrate that the proposed functional is not capable of reproducing the correct one-muon densities as well as some other key properties like muon's kinetic energy, the total energies and the mean muonic bond lengths. Using the muonium atom in a double-harmonic trap as a model we also demonstrate that the successful reproduction of the electron-muon contact hyperfine coupling constants by Deng et al. is probably the result of error cancellations. We also discuss some theoretical intricacies with the very definition of the electron-muon correlation energy within the context of the TC-DFT that must be taken into account in future efforts to design electron-muon correlation functionals.</description>

      <title>Topological magnons in a non-coplanar magnetic order on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bond-dependent Kitaev interaction $K$ is familiar in the effective spin model of transition metal compounds with octahedral ligands. In this work, we find a peculiar non-coplanar magnetic order can be formed with the help of $K$ and next-nearest neighbor Heisenberg coupling $J_2$ on the triangular lattice. It can be seen as a miniature version of skyrmion crystal, since it has nine spins and an integer topological number in a magnetic unit cell. The magnon excitations in such an order are studied by the linear spin-wave theory. Of note is that the change in the relative size of $J_2$ and $K$ produces topological magnon phase transitions although the topological number remains unchanged. We also calculated the experimentally observable thermal Hall conductivity, and found that the signs of thermal Hall conductivity will change with topological phase transitions or temperature changes in certain regions.</description>

      <title>Double pulse all-optical coherent control of ultrafast spin-reorientation in antiferromagnetic rare-earth orthoferrite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pair of circularly polarized laser pulses of opposite helicities are shown to control the route of spin reorientation phase transition in rare-earth antiferromagnetic orthoferrite (Sm$_{0.55}$Tb$_{0.45}$)FeO$_3$. The route can be efficiently controlled by the delay between the pulses and the sample temperature. Simulations employing previously published models of \mbox{laser-induced} spin dynamics in orthoferrites failed to reproduce the experimental results. We suggest that the failure is due to neglected temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic resonance damping in the material. Taking into account the experimentally deduced temperature dependence of the damping, we obtained good agreement between the simulations and the experiment.</description>

      <title>Fully Tunable Fano Resonances in Chiral Electronic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fano resonance is believed to arise when a direct path interferes with a resonant path. We demonstrate that this is not true for chiral electronic transmission without additional direct paths. To address the Fano effect in chiral electronic transport, we suggest an electronic Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer (MZFI), which combines a quantum dot with an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Backscattering is completely suppressed in chiral electronic transport, yielding perfect Fano profiles that can be fully adjusted by an external magnetic flux in the transmission, linear conductance, and differential spectra. Even the current and shot noise for a symmetric interferometer with two arms of the same length exhibit fully controllable resonances and distinct Fano resonance characteristics. Along with the profiles, all of the transport spectra follow the same evolution pattern in a cycle that is resistant to changes in the device's defining parameters.</description>

      <title>Twisted nonlinear optics in monolayer van der Waals crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In addition to a plethora of emergent phenomena, the spatial topology of optical vortices enables an array of applications spanning communications to quantum photonics. Nonlinear optics is essential in this context, providing access to an infinitely large set of quantum states associated with the orbital angular momentum of light. Nevertheless, the realization of such processes have failed to keep pace with the ever-growing need to shrink the fundamental length-scale of photonic technologies to the nanometer regime6. Here, we push the boundaries of vortex nonlinear optics to the ultimate limits of material dimensionality. By exploiting second and third-order frequency-mixing processes in semiconducting monolayers, we demonstrate the independent manipulation of the wavelength, orbital angular momentum, and spatial distribution of vortex light-fields. Due to the atomically-thin nature of the host quantum material, this control spans a broad spectral bandwidth in a highly-integrable platform, unconstrained by the traditional limits of bulk nonlinear optical materials. Our work heralds a new avenue for ultra-compact and scalable hybrid nanotechnologies empowered by twisted nonlinear light-matter interactions in van der Waals quantum nanomaterials.</description>
