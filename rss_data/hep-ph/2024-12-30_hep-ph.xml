      <title>Monte Carlo Study of TeV-Scale String Resonances in Photon-Jet Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: STRINGS is a Monte Carlo (MC) event generator for simulating the production and decay of first and second string resonances in proton-proton collisions. STRINGS can also interface with other programs such as Pythia using the Les Houches Accord to produce more accurate data. In this paper, we validate STRINGS for the simulation of 2-parton $\rightarrow$ $\gamma$-parton scattering events by comparing to previous literature. After validation, we produce MC samples of resonances using $M_s$ = {5.0,5.5,6.0,6.5,7.0} TeV at $\sqrt{s}$ = {13,13.6} TeV with STRINGS and Pythia and analyze the kinematic data. To accurately reproduce previous results close to resonance, it is necessary to introduce a scaling factor of $\approx$ 0.53. With this correction, the resonance structure is as expected.</description>

      <title>Analysis of NOvA and MicroBooNE charged-current inclusive neutrino measurements within the SuSAv2 framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we compare the SuSAv2 model, based on the superscaling phenomenon and the relativistic mean field theory, with charged-current inclusive neutrino cross sections from the NOvA and MicroBooNE experiments, whose targets are composed primarily by 12 C and 40 Ar, respectively. The neutrino energy in these experiments covers a kinematic range from tens of MeV to roughly 20 GeV. Thus, we consider the different reaction mechanisms that contribute significantly to these kinematics, namely quasielastic, two-particle two-hole meson exchange currents, resonances and deep inelastic scattering contributions.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Whispers from Dark Stars Seeding Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First stars powered by dark matter (DM) heating instead of fusion can appear in the early Universe from theories of new physics. These dark stars (DSs) can be significantly larger and cooler than early Population III stars, and could seed supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We show that neutrino emission from supermassive DSs provides a novel window into probing SMBH progenitors. We estimate first DS constraints using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming neutrino telescopes offer distinct opportunities to further explore DS properties.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Standard Model with Chern-Simons type interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extension of the Standard Model with Chern-Simons type interaction contains a new vector massive boson (Chern-Simons boson) that couples to electroweak gauge bosons by the so-called effective Chern-Simons interaction. There is no direct interaction between the Chern-Simons bosons and SM fermions. We consider existing restrictions on the parameters of this SM extension, the effective loop interaction of a new vector boson with SM fermions, and the possibility of the manifestation of the long-lived GeV-scale Chern-Simons bosons in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>LHC-friendly freeze-in dark matter via Higgs portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that single-field freeze-in dark matter barely leaves footprints in dark matter direct detection and collider experiments. This situation can be altered in two-field context. In this work we propose a two-field freeze-in dark matter model through Higgs portal. The observed dark matter relic abundance is obtained by a decay of scalar mediator thermalized in the early Universe. While there is a lack of direct dark matter signals, the scalar mediator is in the reach of HL-LHC either through vector boson fusion or Mono-Z channel. Within allowed scalar mass window of 10-50 GeV, we use improved cuts to derive both $2\sigma$ exclusion and $5\sigma$ discovery limits, depending on the value of Higgs portal coupling. If verified, this scalar mediator signal allows us to infer the freeze-in dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Colliders: High Energy Physics with First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions of vacuum bubbles in the early Universe can act as cosmic-scale high-energy colliders with energy reach close to the Planck scale. Such "cosmic colliders" would represent the most energetic phenomena in our cosmic history, transcending any temperature or energy scale ever reached in our Universe, opening tremendous opportunities for particle physics and cosmology. Such configurations are realized during first-order phase transitions with runaway bubbles -- a topic of significant current research interest as a promising cosmological source of gravitational waves. We discuss recent developments and challenges in the physics of such cosmic colliders, as well as their broad applications for particle physics and cosmology, from dark matter to leptogenesis to gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Learning Broken Symmetries with Approximate Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing symmetries in data allows for significant boosts in neural network training, which is especially important where training data are limited. In many cases, however, the exact underlying symmetry is present only in an idealized dataset, and is broken in actual data, due to asymmetries in the detector, or varying response resolution as a function of particle momentum. Standard approaches, such as data augmentation or equivariant networks fail to represent the nature of the full, broken symmetry, effectively overconstraining the response of the neural network. We propose a learning model which balances the generality and asymptotic performance of unconstrained networks with the rapid learning of constrained networks. This is achieved through a dual-subnet structure, where one network is constrained by the symmetry and the other is not, along with a learned symmetry factor. In a simplified toy example that demonstrates violation of Lorentz invariance, our model learns as rapidly as symmetry-constrained networks but escapes its performance limitations.</description>

      <title>Effective Lagrangian for strong and electromagnetic interactions of high-spin resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments of photon-nucleon and meson-nucleon scatterings have accumulated a lot of data for various meson production processes. One of the purposes of those experiments is to search for the missing resonances which are not discovered until now but whose existence was predicted by hadron models. The analyses of the data requires the development of dynamical coupled-channel models. Since several missing resonances are expected to have spin higher than 3/2, we need to include higher-spin resonances in dynamical coupled-channel models, which enable us to determine the couplings of effective Lagrangians of higher-spin baryons with pseudoscalar mesons or vector mesons. However, hadron models, such as quark models, give predictions only of the decay amplitudes of such baryons. Here we demonstrate the formalism of high-spin resonances and construct the relation between the coupling constants of effective Lagrangians and the partial decay widths that can be predicted by hadron models. This allows us to compare the coupling constants to the hadron model predictions not only in magnitude but in sign as well.</description>

      <title>Towards factorization with emergent scales for jets in dense media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the recently developed open quantum system Effective Field Theory framework, we investigate jet production and evolution in a dense nuclear medium in electron-ion/heavy-ion collisions. We confirm that the frequent monitoring of the jet by the medium leads to the emergence of a perturbative transverse momentum scale, often referred to as the saturation scale that necessitates further factorization to completely isolate the non-perturbative physics of the medium. A part of this goal is achieved in this paper by providing an operator definition for the broadening probability of a gluon in the medium within the Markovian approximations. We show that this distribution is (semi)universal; it depends on the angular measurement on the jet and probes both the large and small $x$ dynamics of the medium. We further elucidate all other contributions to non-perturbative physics suggesting that the parameterization of non-perturbative physics is more complex than previously assumed and outline steps required for a complete factorization of the jet production cross section.</description>

      <title>Impact of resummation on the production and experimental bounds of scalar high-electric-charge objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A one-loop Dyson-Schwinger-like resummation scheme is applied to scalar High-Electric-Charge compact Objects (HECOs), extending previous work on spin-1/2 case. The electromagnetic interactions of HECOs are considered within the framework of strongly coupled scalar Quantun Electrodynamics. The resummation amounts to determining non-trivial ultraviolet (UV) fixed points, at which the effective Lagrangian, which will lead to the pertinent predictions on the cross sections, is computed. In contrast to the fermionic HECO case, in which the fixed point structure was determined solely by the interactions of the HECOs with the photon field, in the scalar case the existence of non-trivial UV fixed points requires the presence of additional strong self interactions among the HECOs. Our resummation scheme, which is notably different from a lattice strong-coupling approach, makes the computation of the pertinent scalar-HECO-production cross sections reliable, thus allowing revisiting the mass bounds obtained from searches for such objects in current or future colliders. Our MadGraph implementation of the results leads to enhanced (up to ~30%) lower bounds on the mass of scalar HECOs, as compared to those extracted from the tree-level processes typically used in LHC collider searches by ATLAS and MoEDAL experiments.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained binning in Drell-Yan transverse momentum spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of the determination of the intrinsic transverse momentum of partons, the intrinsic $k_T$, from the dilepton transverse momentum $p_T$ in Drell-Yan (DY) production at hadron colliders. The result shows that a good sensitivity to the intrinsic $k_T$ distribution is achieved by measuring relative ratios between the cross sections of suitably defined low-$p_T$ and high-$p_T$ regions. The study is performed through both a pseudo-data test and an extraction from measurements of the DY process by the CMS collaboration. Since the methodology does not rely on any dedicated partition of bins, this $p_T$-ratio observable requires less special treatment in very low $p_T$ regions, and propagates lower systematic uncertainties induced from unfolding or momentum migration, in contrast with previous proposals of using a fine-binning measurement of the differential cross section.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the $B^+\to K^+ E_{\mathrm{miss}}$, $B^0\to K^{*0} E_{\mathrm{miss}}$, and $\Lambda_b^0\to \Lambda^0 E_{\mathrm{miss}}$ decays under three different new physics hypotheses: the heavy new particles, the light neutral vector particles, and the axion-like particles. We find that all three hypotheses can resolve the Belle-II excess, and they can be clearly distinguished by the longitudinal polarization fraction of $K^*$. Furthermore, we discover that the longitudinal polarization fraction of $\Lambda$ can be used to distinguish the chirality of the effective operators.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from axions with connection to neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a KSVZ-like extension of the Standard Model with a Dirac fermion and three right-handed neutrinos. PQ symmetry allows the Dirac mass for neutrinos and prevents the Majorana mass. A $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry guarantees the stability of Dirac fermion dark matter. The breakdown of PQ symmetry generates the QCD axion at a high scale. The fermion dark matter relic abundance arises from the UV-freeze-in mechanism through the axion portal. We determine the fermion DM relic by solving stiff Boltzmann equations and finding the allowed parameter space using the relic density constraints. Having determined the allowed parameter space for fermion DM, we also look for the two-component scenario where the axion produced from the misalignment mechanism can co-exist as DM too. We find that both FIMP and axion dark matter have sufficient parameter space that is not excluded while considering several current bounds and future sensitivities on axion and dark matter. Our study highlights the interlinking of dark matter, axion, and neutrinos while addressing the strong CP problem and small neutrino masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-inclusive decay processes of a top quark into a charged pseudo-scalar meson and a jet are studied within the framework of QCD factorization. The leading power of the decay matrix elements can be factorized into heavy-to-light quark transition current and a hadron matrix element up to next-to-leading order QCD corrections. We calculate one-loop virtual corrections together with real gluon emission corrections at the {\alpha}s order. The numerical results of the branching ratios are presented for the sum of two-body and three-body decays. We also study the energy cut-off dependence of the gluon jet. These processes are hopeful to be detected in the near future experiments, which can serve as probes for new physics.</description>

Abstract: Two main ingredients of current particle physics
  such as local gauge symmetry and mass generation via the Higgs mechanism being basic ground of the Standard Model are widely confirmed by
  experimental data. However, some problems such as neutrino masses, dark matter, baryon asymmetry of Universe have clearly indicated that the Standard Model cannot be the ultimate theory of nature. To surpass the mentioned puzzles,
  many extensions of the Standard Model (called beyond Standard Model) have been proposed. Among beyond Standard Models, the 3-3-1 models have some intriguing features and they get wide attention. The pioneer models develop in some directions. In this paper, %some new main versions of the 3-3-1 models and their consequences are presented.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic Axion-like Particles at Forward Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptophilic axion-like particles (ALPs) exhibit rich phenomenology, focusing exclusively on interactions between an ALP and Standard Model (SM) leptons. Through integration by parts, it is shown that both the three-point interaction, $a\bar\ell\ell$ and the four-point interaction, $a\ell^-\nu W^+$, play significant roles, making the flavor portal particularly compelling. For ALPs with masses ranging from $\mathcal O(1)$ MeV to $\mathcal O(1)$ GeV, they can contribute to exotic hadron decays. Suppressed couplings naturally extend the ALP lifetime, presenting opportunities for detection at forward detectors. In this study, we explore ALPs with both electrophilic and muonphilic scenarios. We propose an inclusive search for various hadrons that undergo exotic decays at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the electrophilic scenario, long-lived ALPs are searched in the Forward Search Experiment (FASER) and its upgrading phase, FASER II. In the muonphilic scenario, where the ALP lifetime is significantly reduced due to its coupling to muons, we further investigate its detection potential at LHCb and its high-luminosity upgrade. Several benchmarks are analyzed, including electroweak-preserving, electroweak-violating and left-right softly asymmetric models, to demonstrate possible experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Simulations of the Sterile Neutrino Oscillations with a Crossing-Width Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an algorithm to generate the collider events of the GeV-scale oscillating sterile neutrinos with the ready-made event generation tools in the case that the crossing-widths among the nearly-degenerate fermionic fields arise. We prove the validity of our algorithm, and adopt some tricks for practical calculations. The formulations of the particle oscillation processes are also improved in the framework of the quantum field theory, offering us the ability to simulate the flying distances of the oscillating intermediate sterile neutrinos while regarding them as the internal lines in the Feynmann diagrams.</description>

      <title>Violation of Parity and Flavor Symmetries in a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with certain continuous chiral and two-flavor symmetries. For the Hamiltonian of the model, we construct a ground state which breaks the parity and flavor symmetries. In our argument, the chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for proving the violation of the parity and flavor symmetries, although the model does not contain the so-called Wilson term.</description>

      <title>Exploring $Z'$ and Right-Handed Neutrinos in the BLSM at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenological implications of the \( B-L \) extension of the Standard Model (BLSM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with an emphasis on the production and decay of the \( Z' \) boson into pairs of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). These decays result in three distinct channels with observable final states: (i) four leptons, (ii) three leptons plus two jets, both accompanied by missing transverse energy, and (iii) two leptons with multiple jets. To enhance sensitivity to \( Z' \) and RHN signals over the standard model background, we employ \texttt{XGBOOST} based analyses to optimize the selection criteria. Our findings demonstrate that these channels provide promising opportunities to probe new physics, offering critical insights into the mechanisms of neutrino mass generation and baryon asymmetry in the universe.</description>

      <title>Exploring semi-relativistic p-wave dark matter annihilation in minimal Higgs portal near supermassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential annihilation processes of light dark matter (DM) in minimal Higgs portal models near supermassive black hole (Sgr A$^{\star}$) in the Galactic Center, considering interactions between DM particles mediated by either a light scalar or pseudoscalar with couplings \( c_s \) and \( c_p \). Accelerated by the supermassive black hole, DM particles can reach velocities up to half the speed of light, significantly enhancing the \( p \)-wave annihilation cross-section, allowing forbidden annihilation channels within specific mass ranges, and producing unique gamma-ray spectral signals. Utilizing gamma-ray observation from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) in the direction of Sgr $A^{\star}$, we constrain light DM parameter in the mass range of \( 0.3-10 \, \text{GeV} \) . Our results indicate that the couplings \( c_s \) and \( c_p \) are constrained to the order of \( 10^{-5} \), corresponding to a DM annihilation cross-section as low as \( 10^{-38} \)$ {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$. In the future, the Very Large Gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST), with a larger detection area and broader detection range from $1$ MeV to $1$ TeV, will enhance our ability to probe sub-GeV DM and offer the opportunity to further study the forbidden annihilation scenario.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD corrections to unpolarized and polarized SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process requires the presence of an identified hadron H$'$ in the final state, which arises from the scattering of a lepton with an initial hadron P. By employing factorization in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), SIDIS provides essential knowledge on the hadron structure, enabling the exploration of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). The coefficient functions for SIDIS can be calculated in perturbative QCD and are currently known to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for the cases, where the incoming lepton and the hadron P are either both polarized or unpolarized. We present a detailed description of these NNLO computations, including a thorough discussion of all the partonic channels, the calculation of the amplitudes and master integrals for the phase-space integration as well as the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences and mass factorization of infrared divergences in dimensional regularization through NNLO. We provide an extensive phenomenological analysis of the effects of NNLO corrections on SIDIS cross sections for different PDFs and FFs and various kinematics, including those of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We find that these corrections are not only significant but also crucial for reducing the dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ to obtain stable predictions.</description>

      <title>The Deconstruction of Flavor in the Privately Democratic Higgs Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics fails to explain the observed hierarchy in fermion masses or the origin of fermion-flavor structure. We construct a model to explain these observations in the quark sector. We introduce a spectrum of new particles consisting of six of each -- massive singlet vector-like quarks (VLQs), singlet scalars, and SU(2)-doublet scalars. SM quark masses are generated when the neutral components of the SU(2)-doublet scalars acquire non-zero vacuum expectation values (VEVs). We impose global symmetries to ensure that Yukawa couplings stay roughly flavor diagonal and democratic (of the same order), as well as to suppress tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents. Quark-mass hierarchy then follows from a hierarchy in scalar VEVs. The singlet scalars also acquire weak-scale VEVs. Together with the VLQs, they act as messengers between different generations of quarks in the SM. These messenger particles are responsible for generating the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Masakawa (CKM) matrix which depend on the ratios of the singlet VEVs and VLQ masses. Constructed this way, the CKM matrix is found to be \emph{independent} of the SM fermion masses. Using the measured values of the CKM matrix elements and assuming order-one couplings, we derive constraints on the masses of the VLQs and discuss prospects for probing our model in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the mass of a self-interacting dark matter candidate, specifically a Dirac fermion, can be generated by composite dynamics, with a light scalar mediator emerging alongside the Higgs itself as composite particles. These novel models naturally explain the halo structure problems at various scales and alleviates the Standard Model naturalness problem simultaneously. The relic density of the dark matter candidates is particle anti-particle symmetric and due to thermal freeze-out. These models are four-dimensional gauge theories with a minimal number of fermions charged under a new confining gauge group. Finally, we demonstrate that these models satisfy various constraints set by the dark matter relic density, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, as well as direct and indirect detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of vector mesons in local equilibrium by Zubarev's approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the $00$ element of the spin density matrix, denoted as $\rho_{00}$ and called the spin alignment, up to the second order of the gradient expansion in local equilibrium by Zubarev's approach. In the first order, we obtain $\rho_{00}=1/3$, meaning that the contributions from thermal vorticity and shear stress tensor are vanishing. The non-vanishing contributions to $\rho_{00}-1/3$ appear in the second order of gradients in the Belinfante and canonical cases. We also discuss the properties of the spin density matrix under the time reversal transformation. The effective transport coefficient for the spin alignment induced by the thermal shear stress tensor is T-odd in the first order, implying that the first order effect is dissipative.</description>

      <title>Vector and Tensor Spin Polarization for Vector Bosons at Local Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive expressions for the vector and tensor components of the spin polarization of massive vector bosons at local thermodynamic equilibrium up to second order in the space-time gradients of the thermodynamic fields pertaining to the canonical stress-energy tensor and spin tensor of the free Proca field. A set of Feynman rules is devised to calculate the Wigner function and the matrix-valued spin-dependent distribution (MVSD) functions order by order in space-time gradients. Due to constraints imposed by time-reversal symmetry, the leading contribution to spin alignment - defined as the 00-component of the tensor polarization - arises from second-order terms in MVSD, for which we provide an analytic formula. We discuss the physical meaning of different contributions to vector and tensor polarization. These formulae provide a prediction of a contribution to the spin alignment which can be compared with the observations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling E$_6$SSM Scalar Diquarks at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of scalar diquarks with sub-TeV masses within the framework of the $E_6$ Supersymmetric Standard Model (E$_6$SSM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Focusing on the lightest of the six diquarks predicted by the model, we select some representative low masses for them in a parameter space region consistent with experimental constraints from direct searches for additional Higgs boson(s), Cold Dark Matter (CDM), and supersymmetry, as well as from flavor physics analyses. Using Monte Carlo ($MC$) simulations, we assess these benchmark points against the latest LHC results corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. We further evaluate the signal significance of the pair-production of these diquarks, when each of them decays into $tb$ pairs, at the $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV LHC Run 3 with design integrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$, and also at the 3000 fb$^{-1}$ High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Our analysis yields a statistical significance exceeding $3\sigma$ at the HL-LHC for diquark masses up to 1 TeV, indicating promising prospects for their discovery.</description>

      <title>Domain walls in Nelson-Barr axion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a concrete realization of a Nelson-Barr model addressing the strong CP problem with suppressed unfavorable corrections. This model has a scalar field that spontaneously breaks discrete symmetry, and its phase component can naturally be relatively light, which we call the Nelson-Barr axion. It has both a tree-level potential and the QCD instanton-induced potential like the QCD axion, each minimizing at the CP-conserving point. While one potential leads to domain wall formation, the other works as a potential bias. This model provides a natural setup for the collapse of the axion domain walls by a potential bias without spoiling a solution to the strong CP problem. We discuss the cosmological implications of domain wall collapses, including dark matter production and gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Bayesian Exploration of Froggatt-Nielsen Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism successfully explains the hierarchical structure of fermion Yukawa couplings by introducing a U(1) flavor symmetry with distinct charge assignments for different fermion generations. While some FN charge assignments have been proposed, their evaluation has largely relied on heuristic approaches. This paper systematically investigates viable FN charge assignments within the Standard Model, including both the quark and lepton sectors, using Bayesian statistical analysis. The study explores scenarios involving both the seesaw mechanism and dimension-five operators for neutrino mass generation. A comprehensive parameter scan over FN charges reveals a wide range of charge assignments consistent with observed fermion masses and mixing angles. Interestingly, negative FN charges and significant generational differences in charges are found to be viable, contrary to conventional assumptions. The analysis also compares the seesaw mechanism and dimension-five operator scenarios, finding no strong preference between them for optimal charge assignments. Furthermore, predictions for the lightest neutrino mass and effective Majorana mass relevant for neutrinoless double-beta decay are presented, highlighting regions of parameter space accessible to upcoming experiments. Finally, implications for nucleon decay are studied, demonstrating that different FN charge assignments predict significantly different nucleon decay lifetimes and branching ratios, providing a potential experimental probe for FN models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the partial decay widths of a spin-parity resonance $J^P=3/2^-$ $N^*$ with a mass of $\simeq$ 2070 MeV obtained from the coupled channel s wave vector-baryon $\rho N$, $\omega N$, $\phi N$, $K^*\Lambda$ and $K^*\Sigma$ dynamics. This state, which couples strongly to the $K^*\Sigma$ channel, corresponds to a nucleon with a hidden strange quark content, in analogy to the $P_c$ states discovered by the LHCb collaboration, and we denote it as $P_s(2080)$. A state with such a nature can decay to vector-baryon, pseudoscalar-baryon, and pseudoscalar-baryon resonance channels, involving triangular loops in the latter two cases. As we will show, the partial decay widths to pseudoscalar-baryon resonance channels, like $\pi N^*(1535)$, $\pi N^*(1650)$, $K\Lambda(1405)$, are comparable to those related to ground state baryons in the final state, like $\pi N$, $\eta N$, $K\Lambda$. In this way, reactions involving such lighter baryon resonances in the final state can be used as an alternative source of information on the properties of a $N^*$ with hidden strangeness.</description>

      <title>Muonium fine structure: theory update, tests of Lorentz violation and experimental prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the status of the QED calculations for the muonium $2S_{1/2}-2P_{3/2}$ energy interval and provide the updated theoretical value of $9874.357\pm0.001\,\mathrm{MHz}$. Additionally, we present a model for probing Lorentz-violating coefficients within the Standard Model Extension framework using the fine structure measurement in the presence and absence of a weak external magnetic field, enabling novel tests of CPT and Lorentz symmetry. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that a precision of $\sim 10\,\mathrm{kHz}$ on the isolated $2S_{1/2}, F=1 - 2P_{3/2}, F=1$ transition could be achievable employing Ramsey's separate oscillatory fields (SOF) technique. Collecting the required statics will become feasible with the upcoming High-Intensity Muon Beam (HiMB) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. These advancements will enable precise tests of radiative QED corrections and nuclear self-energy contributions, while also providing tests of new physics and sensitivity to unconstrained coefficients for Lorentz violation within the Standard Model Extension framework.</description>

      <title>Composite nature of the $T_{cc}$ state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, LHCb collaboration reported a very narrow state in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ mass spectrum just below the $D^{*+}D^0$ mass threshold. We consider the influence of the Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson (CDD) pole in the scattering amplitude to derive a general treatment for the two-body final state interaction near its threshold. The line shape (or the energy dependent event distribution) are then obtained, where the parameters can be fixed by fitting to the experimental data on the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ mass spectrum. Within our method the data are quite well reproduced. The pole structure in the complex energy plane indicates the bound state structure of the $T_{cc}$ state. The compositeness as a measure of molecule component in its hadron wave function is predicted to be $0.23_{-0.09}^{+0.40}$. The non-molecular component, e.g., the compact tetraquark also takes a non-negligible portion.</description>

      <title>Net-Baryon Number Probability Distribution As an Indicator of Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The net-baryon number probability distribution and the related pressure and density are studied in the Cluster Expansion Model (CEM) and the obtained results are extrapolated to the domain of low temperatures. It is found that the rate of decrease of the net-baryon number probability mass function diminishes with the temperature and, in the extensions of the CEM, falls to the level consistent with the phase transition at large baryon chemical potentials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the process $\mu^-\mu^+\to {\nu_\mu}\bar{\nu}_\mu t\bar{t}H$ with complex CP violating $ttH$ couplings in the SMEFT with a dimension-6 operator. When the amplitudes are expressed in the Feynman-Diagram gauge, the dominance of the total cross section via the weak boson fusion diagrams is manifest. The high energy behaviour is dictated by the higher-dimensional vertices in the dimension-6 SMEFT operator. These properties are not manifest in the unitary gauge because of subtle cancellation among diagrams.</description>

      <title>Minimal dark matter in $SU(5)$ grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal dark matter is an attractive candidate for dark matter because it is stabilized without the need to impose additional symmetries. It is known that the mass of the $SU(2)_L$ quintuplet fermion dark matter is predicted to be around 14 TeV, based on the thermal production mechanism. In this work, we embed the quintuplet dark matter within non-supersymmetric $SU(5)$ grand unified theories. We find that two pairs of colored sextet fermions are required at the $\mathcal{O}(1-10)~\mathrm{TeV}$ scale to achieve gauge coupling unification, with the unification scale near the reduced Planck scale. These colored sextet fermions become metastable because their interactions are suppressed by the unification scale. Our model can be tested through comprehensive searches for colored sextet fermions in collider experiments, as well as through indirect and direct detection methods for minimal dark matter.</description>

      <title>DLScanner: A parameter space scanner package assisted by deep learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a scanner package enhanced by deep learning (DL) techniques. The proposed package addresses two significant challenges associated with previously developed DL-based methods: slow convergence in high-dimensional scans and the limited generalization of the DL network when mapping random points to the target space. To tackle the first issue, we utilize a similarity learning network that maps sampled points into a representation space. In this space, in-target points are grouped together while out-target points are effectively pushed apart. This approach enhances the scan convergence by refining the representation of sampled points. The second challenge is mitigated by integrating a dynamic sampling strategy. Specifically, we employ a VEGAS mapping to adaptively suggest new points for the DL network while also improving the mapping when more points are collected. Our proposed framework demonstrates substantial gains in both performance and efficiency compared to other scanning methods.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative effects in triple-differential dijet and Z+jet production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In comparisons of precision collider data to the most accurate highest-order calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), it is required to correct for nonperturbative effects. Such effects are typically studied using Monte Carlo event generators that complement fixed-order predictions with perturbative parton showers and models for the nonperturbative effects of the Underlying Event and hadronisation. Thereby, the final state of collision events can be predicted at the level of stable particles, which serve as input for full detector simulations.
  This article investigates the impact of nonperturbative effects on two processes that may be used for precision determinations of the strong coupling constant and the proton structure: the triple-differential dijet and Z+jet production. While nonperturbative effects impact both processes, significant differences among them are observed and further investigated. Indications are found that the Underlying Event and hadronisation cannot fully explain these differences and the perturbative modelling may play a significant role as well.</description>

      <title>Schwinger pair production in spacetime fields: Moir\'e patterns, Aharonov-Bohm phases and Sturm-Liouville eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a worldline-instanton formalism to study the momentum spectrum of Schwinger pair production in spacetime fields with multiple stationary points. We show that the interference structure changes fundamentally when going from purely time-dependent to space-time-dependent fields. For example, it was known that two time-dependent pulses give interference if they are anti-parallel, i.e. $E_z(t)-E_z(t-\Delta t)$, but here we show that two spacetime pulses will typically give interference if they instead are parallel, i.e. $E_z(t,z)+E_z(t-\Delta t,z-\Delta z)$. We take into account the fact that the momenta of the electron, $p_z$, and of the positron, $p'_z$, are independent for $E_z(t,z)$ (it would be $p_z+p'_z=0$ for $E(t)$), and find a type of fields which give moir\'e patterns in the $p_z-p'_z$ plane. Depending on the separation of two pulses, we also find an Aharonov-Bohm phase. We also study complex momentum saddle points in order to obtain the integrated probability from the spectrum. Finally, we calculate an asymptotic expansion for the eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville equation that corresponds to the saddle-point approximation of the worldline path integral, use that expansion to compute the product of eigenvalues, and compare with the result obtained with the Gelfand-Yaglom method.</description>

      <title>TooLQit: Leptoquark Models and Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the leptoquark (LQ) toolkit, TooLQit, which includes leading-order FeynRules models for all types of LQs and a Python-based calculator, named CaLQ, to test if a set of parameter points are allowed by the LHC dilepton searches. The models include electroweak gauge interactions of the LQs and follow a set of intuitive notations. Currently, CaLQ can calculate the LHC limits on LQ ($S_1$ and $U_1$) couplings (one or more simultaneously) for any mass between $1$ and $5$ TeV using a $\chi^2$ method. In this manual for TooLQit, we describe the FeynRules models and discuss the techniques used in CaLQ. We outline the workflow to check parameter spaces of LQ models with an example. We show some illustrative scans for one- and multi-coupling scenarios for the $U_1$ vector LQ. The TooLQit code is available at https://github.com/rsrchtsm/TooLQit</description>

      <title>Hard Photon Triggered Jets in $p$-$p$ and $A$-$A$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An investigation of high transverse momentum (high-$p_T$) photon triggered jets in proton-proton ($p$-$p$) and ion-ion ($A$-$A$) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 0.2$ and $5.02~\mathrm{TeV}$ is carried out, using the multistage description of in-medium jet evolution. Monte Carlo simulations of hard scattering and energy loss in heavy-ion collisions are performed using parameters tuned in a previous study of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) for inclusive jets and high-$p_T$ hadrons. We obtain a good reproduction of the experimental data for photon triggered jet $R_{AA}$, as measured by the ATLAS detector, the distribution of the ratio of jet to photon $p_T$ ($X_{\rm J \gamma}$), measured by both CMS and ATLAS, and the photon-jet azimuthal correlation as measured by CMS. We obtain a moderate description of the photon triggered jet $I_{AA}$, as measured by STAR. A noticeable improvement in the comparison is observed when one goes beyond prompt photons and includes bremsstrahlung and decay photons, revealing their significance in certain kinematic regions, particularly at $X_{J\gamma} &gt; 1$. Moreover, azimuthal angle correlations demonstrate a notable impact of non-prompt photons on the distribution, emphasizing their role in accurately describing experimental results. This work highlights the success of the multistage model of jet modification to straightforwardly predict (this set of) photon triggered jet observables. This comparison, along with the role played by non-prompt photons, has important consequences on the inclusion of such observables in a future Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Right-handed neutrino production through first-generation leptoquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collider phenomenology of leptoquarks (LQs) and right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) has been studied extensively in the literature. Because of the gauge singlet nature, the production of RHNs at the LHC is typically suppressed by the tiny light-heavy neutrino mixing angles. In this study, we explore a promising scenario where the presence of an LQ mediator significantly enhances RHN production. We focus on first-generation scalar and vector LQs interacting with the first-generation RHN. The prospects are better for the first-generation scenario than the other generations because of the enhanced parton distribution functions (PDFs) of first-generation quarks. The enhanced PDFs boost the production cross sections of LQs, particularly their single and indirect productions. Incorporating all production modes of LQs that result in a pair of RHNs, we estimate the discovery prospects by analysing the monoelectron and dielectron channels arising from the decay of the RHN pair. We find that the indirect production of LQs is crucial in determining the discovery reach at the HL-LHC for the first-generation scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear trident, $e^{\scriptscriptstyle -}\to e^{\scriptscriptstyle -} e^{\scriptscriptstyle -} e^{\scriptscriptstyle +}$, in various electric background fields. This process has so far been studied for plane-wave backgrounds, using Volkov solutions. Here we first use WKB for trident in time-dependent electric fields, and then for fields which vary slowly in space. Then we show how to use worldline instantons for more general fields which depend on both time and space.</description>

      <title>Non-Scaling Topological Defects and Gravitational Waves in Higgs Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model is the Higgs portal extension involving a dark Higgs. Dark sectors that include dark matter candidates, WIMPs, axions, and dark photons, can naturally have this type of interaction, where the dark Higgs is charged under some symmetry, which may or may not be spontaneous broken by the vacuum expectation value. In this paper, using lattice simulations, I show that if the reheating temperature of the Universe is sufficiently high, topological defects such as domain walls and cosmic strings associated with these symmetries are naturally formed even if the symmetries are never restored due to negative thermal mass squareds. This occurs due to the early Universe's non-adiabatic oscillation of the Higgs around the onset of oscillation, which overshoots the origin, and tachyonic instability that enhances fluctuations. The gravitational waves generated by these topological defects may be very significant due to the energetic processes induced by matter effects in the hot and dense Universe irrelevant to the typical energy scale of the dark sector in the vacuum or whether the symmetry is broken in the vacuum. Alongside earlier studies such as usual phase transition, melting domain walls and melting cosmic strings scenarios that assume a symmetric phase in the early Universe, the Higgs portal models naturally predict local overdensities from topological defects, which may induce miniclusters and primordial black holes, as well as the gravitational waves.These phenomena provide novel opportunities to search for such scenarios. I also perform various numerical simulations for the relevant topic including melting domain walls and cosmic strings with inflationary and Gaussian fluctuations, for comparison--which have not been performed previously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in generic matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a redshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments, proportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations demonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter distributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment and the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute environments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and damping times, with $U \sim -{\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the environment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\cal C}$.</description>

      <title>Phase and equation of state of finite density QC$_2$D at lower temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD at low temperatures, $T = 40$ MeV ($32^4$ lattice) and $T = 80$ MeV ($16^4$ lattice). A rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential $\mu$ has been revealed. By performing $T = 40$ MeV simulations, essentially similar results to the previous ones at $T = 80$ MeV are obtained, but several finer understandings are achieved. Breaking of the conformal bound is also confirmed thanks to smaller statistical errors. This talk is mainly based on Refs.~\cite{Iida:2022hyy, Iida:2024irv}. It also includes related studies and subsequent developments that were not mentioned in the original papers.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter properties from chiral-scale effective theory including a dilatonic scalar meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory has become a powerful tool for studying the low-energy properties of QCD. In this work, we apply an extended chiral effective theory -- chiral-scale effective theory -- including a dilatonic scalar meson to study nuclear matter and find that the properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Compared to the traditionally used Walecka-type models in nuclear matter studies, our approach improves the behavior of symmetry energy and the incompressibility coefficient in describing empirical data without introducing additional freedoms. Moreover, the predicted neutron star structures fall within the constraints of GW170817, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0030+0451, while the maximum neutron star mass can reach about $~3M_{\odot}$ with a pure hadronic phase. Additionally, we find that symmetry patterns of the effective theory significantly impact neutron star structures. %In chiral-scale effective theory, effective operators are well organized by chiral-scale orders and freedoms induced by QCD symmetry patterns. We believe that introducing this type of theory into nuclear matter studies can lead to a deeper understanding of QCD, nuclear matter, and compact astrophysical objects.</description>

Abstract: We present phenomenological signatures for a modified gravity model f(R), constructed with linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic terms. The obtained signatures satisfy current phenomenological bounds reported by PLANCK and BICEP3. Furthermore, two of the model solutions $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ seem to favor a much lower value for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $0.0005&lt;r_{\sigma_1}&lt;0.0015$ and $r_{\sigma_2}&lt;0.00015$ than the current reported experimental bounds. The results we obtained are quantitatively similar to those presented in previous studies for $R^3$ models.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scenario based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics: Thermodynamic constraints on a generalized cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first and second laws of thermodynamics should lead to a consistent scenario for discussing the cosmological constant problem. In the present study, to establish such a thermodynamic scenario, cosmological equations in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe were derived from the first law, using an arbitrary entropy $S_{H}$ on a cosmological horizon. Then, the cosmological equations were formulated based on a general formulation that includes two extra driving terms, $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$, which are usually used for, e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology and bulk viscous cosmology, respectively. In addition, thermodynamic constraints on the two terms are examined using the second law of thermodynamics, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 99, 043523 (2019) (arXiv:1810.11138)]. It is found that a deviation $S_{\Delta}$ of $S_{H}$ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy plays important roles in the two terms. The second law should constrain the upper limits of $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ and $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ in our late Universe. The orders of the two terms are likely consistent with the order of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$ measured by observations. In particular, when the deviation $S_{\Delta}$ is close to zero, $h_{\textrm{B}}(t)$ and $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ should reduce to zero and a constant value (consistent with the order of $\Lambda_{\textrm{obs}}$), respectively, as if a consistent and viable scenario could be obtained from thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting the dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is believed to account for a significant portion of the mass in the universe, exerting a critical influence on the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. This research delves into the processes of annihilation and decay of dark matter particles, which generate observable signals that deepen our comprehension of their characteristics and behaviors. Furthermore, the study explores the potential role of primordial black holes, with a focus on the emissions of Hawking radiation that could offer valuable insights into their distribution and size range. A key aspect of this investigation revolves around the 21 cm signal, a vital tool for scrutinizing the effects of dark matter particles and primordial black hole phenomena on the intergalactic medium. The upcoming Hongmeng mission, featuring a lunar orbital interferometer array, is poised to revolutionize our ability to observe the 21 cm signal. By conducting measurements devoid of atmospheric disturbances, the mission will significantly boost sensitivity to subtle signals associated with dark matter particle annihilation, decay, and primordial black hole emissions. This study assesses the expected performance of the Hongmeng mission in detecting these telltale signs and aims to unveil fresh insights into the nature and interactions of dark matter particles and primordial black hole emissions through a meticulous analysis of the global 21 cm spectrum. The mission holds immense promise for reshaping our understanding of the universe's concealed components.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Post-Collision of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) can form a stable equilibrium configuration, the so-called FDM soliton. The SP system can also determine the evolution of FDM solitons, such as head-on collision. In this paper, we first propose a new adimensional unit of length, time and mass. And then, we simulate the adimensional SP system with $\mathtt{PyUltraLight}$ to study the GWs from post-collision of FDM solitons when the linearized theory is valid and the GW back reaction on the evolution of FDM solitons is ignored. Finally, we find that the GWs from post-collisions have a frequency of (few ten-years)$^{-1}$ or (few years)$^{-1}$ when FDM mass is $m=10^{-18}\rm{eV}/c^2$ or $m=10^{-17}\rm{eV}/c^2$. Therefore, future detection of such GWs will constrain the property of FDM particle and solitons.</description>

      <title>Probing medium response via strangeness enhancement around quenched jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet-induced medium excitation is a crucial part of jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and has recently been confirmed by experiment for the first time. Based on the AMPT model simulation, we propose the strangeness enhancement around quenched jets as a novel signature of jet-induced medium excitation. By applying the jet-particle correlation techniques, we calculate jet-induced particle yields around the jets and find a significant enhancement of the strange-to-non-strange-hadron ratio and the double-to-single-strange-hadron ratio correlated with jets in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions relative to proton-proton collisions. This enhancement increases with both the strength of jet-QGP interactions and the radial distance from jet axis. These observations align with the features of jet-induced medium excitation and parton coalescence in hadron formation, and await experimental validation in the future measurements.</description>

      <title>GRB multi-TeV detection: Beyond standard physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection by LHAASO up to 18 TeV of the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A at redshift $z = 0.151$ challenges standard physics because of the strong absorption due to the extragalactic background light (EBL) for photons with energies above 10 TeV. Emission models partially avoiding EBL absorption proposed to explain such an event are unsatisfactory since they require peculiar and contrived assumptions. By introducing in magnetized media the interaction of photons with axion-like particles (ALPs) - which are a generic prediction of most theories extending the standard model of particle physics towards a more satisfying theory - the detection of GRB 221009A can be naturally explained, thereby providing a strong hint at ALP existence.</description>

      <title>Double Exponents in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and argue that such transfer may remain inefficient at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>Experimental search potential for sbottom via $\tilde\chi^{\pm}_1$ decays at the LHC Run-3 and HL-LHC, in final states with same-sign leptons and multiple jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the experimental search potential for sbottom pair production in an R-parity conserving scenario at the LHC Run-3 and HL-LHC. The sbottom decays with a 100% BR via a chargino, $\tilde{b}_1 \to t \tilde{\chi}_1^\pm$, which subsequently decays to a $W$ boson and a neutralino, $\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm \to W \tilde{\chi}_1^0$, also with a 100% BR. The study follows the ATLAS object definitions and event selection criteria from Ref. JHEP06(2020)046, focusing on Rpc2L1b and Rpc2L2b signal regions defined with same-sign leptons and at least one $b$-tagged jet. Projected exclusion limits are presented in the $\tilde{b}_1$ - $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ mass plane for three center-of-mass energies (13 TeV, 13.6 TeV, and 14 TeV) and three integrated luminosity scenarios (139 fb$^{-1}$, 300 fb$^{-1}$, and 3000 fb$^{-1}$).

      <title>QCD axion dark matter in the dark dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed dark dimension scenario reveals that the axions can be localized on the Standard Model brane, thereby predicting the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion decay constant from the weak gravity conjecture: $f_a\lesssim M_5 \sim 10^{9}-10^{10}\, \rm GeV$, where $M_5$ is the five-dimensional Planck mass. When combined with observational lower bounds, this implies that $f_a$ falls within a narrow range $f_a\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}\, \rm GeV$, corresponding to the axion mass $m_a\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\, \rm eV$. At this scale, the QCD axion constitutes a minor fraction of the total cold dark matter (DM) density $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. In this work, we investigate the issue of QCD axion DM within the context of the dark dimension and demonstrate that the QCD axion in this scenario can account for the entire DM abundance through a simple two-axion mixing mechanism. Here we consider the resonant conversion of an axion-like particle (ALP) into a QCD axion. We find that, in a scenario where the ALP possesses a mass of approximately $m_A \sim 10^{-5} \, \rm eV$ and a decay constant of $f_A \sim 10^{11} \, \rm GeV$, the QCD axion in the dark dimension scenario can account for the overall DM.</description>

Abstract: We study oscillons in a real scalar field theory in a (3+1)-dimensional AdS space with global coordinates. The initial configuration is given by a Gaussian shape with an appropriate core size as in Minkowski spacetime. The solution exhibits a long lifetime. In particular, since the AdS space can be seen as a box, the recurrence phenomenon can be observed under suitable conditions. Finally, we discuss some potential applications of the oscillon in the context of AdS/CFT duality.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dineutrons on nuclear compositions and neutrino reactions of the core-collapse supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nuclear compositions and neutrino reaction rates in the central region of the core-collapse supernova, assuming the existence of dineutrons ($^2n$) and tetraneutrons ($^4n$). At 100 ms after core bounce, $^2n$ and $^4n$ are more abundant than deuterons within radii of approximately 100 km and 50 km, respectively. Compared to the model ignoring the existence of $^2n$ and $^4n$, the mass fraction of neutrons up to a radius of 100 km reduces. Hence, the neutrino absorption and antineutrino emission rates decrease by approximately 40%-50%. Conversely, those of protons, deuterons, and $^4He$ increase, leading to the increase in the neutrino emission and antineutrino absorption rates by approximately eight times within a radius of 100 km.</description>

Abstract: We calculate n-point hard string scattering amplitudes (HSSA) with n-2 tachyons and 2 tensor states at arbitrary mass levels. We discover the stringy scaling behavior of these HSSA. It is found that for HSSA with more than 2 transverse directions, the degree of stringy scaling dimM2 decreases comparing to the degree of stringy scaling dimM1 of the n-1 tachyons and 1 tensor HSSA calculated previously. Moreover, we propose a set of K-identities which is the key to demonstrate the stringy scaling behavior of HSSA. We explicitly prove both the diagonal and off-diagonal K-identities for the 4-point HSSA and give numerical proofs of these K-identities for some higher point HSSA.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift ($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped (RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger, heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Flavor Physics at CEPC: a General Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the landscape of flavor physics at the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), based on the nominal luminosity outlined in its Technical Design Report. The CEPC is designed to operate in multiple modes to address a variety of tasks. At the $Z$ pole, the expected production of 4 Tera $Z$ bosons will provide unique and highly precise measurements of $Z$ boson couplings, while the substantial number of boosted heavy-flavored quarks and leptons produced in clean $Z$ decays will facilitate investigations into their flavor physics with unprecedented precision. We investigate the prospects of measuring various physics benchmarks and discuss their implications for particle theories and phenomenological models. Our studies indicate that, with its highlighted advantages and anticipated excellent detector performance, the CEPC can explore beauty and $\tau$ physics in ways that are superior to or complementary with the Belle II and Large-Hadron-Collider-beauty experiments, potentially enabling the detection of new physics at energy scales of 10 TeV and above. This potential also extends to the observation of yet-to-be-discovered rare and exotic processes, as well as testing fundamental principles such as lepton flavor universality, lepton and baryon number conservation, etc., making the CEPC a vibrant platform for flavor physics research. The $WW$ threshold scan, Higgs-factory operation and top-pair productions of the CEPC further enhance its merits in this regard, especially for measuring the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements, and Flavor-Changing-Neutral-Current physics of Higgs boson and top quarks. We outline the requirements for detector performance and considerations for future development to achieve the anticipated scientific goals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1106.5580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of an active neutrinos mass origin is considered at the phenomenological level. At first an assumption is made that neutrino mass values depend on two contributions with their characteristic scales, a next assumption consists in their dependence on three dominant scales. The neutrino mass values as well as the values of neutrino mass observables $m_C$ and $m_{\beta}$ are estimated.</description>

      <title>Determination of Majorana type-phases from the time evolution of lepton numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated an approach to determine the Majorana type-phases using the time evolution of lepton family numbers. The Majorana type-phases are related to the orientation of unitarity triangles for the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix,and the Majorana phases $\alpha_{21}$ and $\alpha_{31}$. After taking the second-order time derivative of the lepton family number expectation values, the dependencies on the summation of Majorana type-phases can be determined. Thus allowing for the extraction of the orientation of the unitarity triangles and the Majorana phases. We study how to extract the Majorana type-phases and the lightest neutrino mass for three massive neutrinos, and when a neutrino is massless, i.e., $m_{1,3}=0$. Theoretically, our results indicate lepton number can be used to determine the orientation of the PMNS unitarity triangles and the Majorana phases. To show how the Majorana phases and Majorana-type phases are related to the CP violation for leptogenesis at high energy, we first adopt a parametrization where the diagonal elements of the effective Majorana mass matrix at low energy are given by real positive numbers. In this basis, the phase of the off-diagonal elements related to the CP violating phases in PMNS matrix. We explicitly show the relation between the single Majorana phase and the phase of the effective Majorana mass matrix for two generation case of active neutrinos. Then for type I seesaw model with two gauge singlet neutrinos and two families of lepton doublet, we study the effective Majorana mass matrix generated by the seesaw model.We are able to show how the Majorana phase at low energy is related to two CP violating phases in the seesaw model and the relation between Majorana phase at low energy and CP violating phases related to the lepton number asymmetries of the heavy Majorana neutrinos decays is established.</description>

      <title>Boosted top tagging and its interpretation using Shapley values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Top tagging has emerged as a fast-evolving subject due to the top quark's significant role in probing physics beyond the standard model. For the reconstruction of top jets, machine learning models have shown a substantial improvement in the classification performance compared to the previous methods. In this work, we build top taggers using $N$-Subjettiness ratios and several Energy Correlation observables as input features to train the eXtreme Gradient BOOSTed decision tree (XGBOOST). The study finds that tighter parton-level matching lead to more accurate tagging. However, in real experimental data, where the parton level data are unknown, this matching cannot be done. We train the XGBOOST models without performing this matching and show that this difference impacts the taggers' effectiveness. Additionally, we test the tagger under different simulation conditions, including changes in center-of-mass energy, parton distribution functions (PDFs), and pileup effects, demonstrating its robustness with performance deviations of less than 1%. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) framework to calculate the importance of the features of the trained models. It helps us to estimate how much each feature of the data contributed to the model's prediction and what regions are of more importance for each input variable. Finally, we combine all the tagger variables to form a hybrid tagger and interpret the results using the Shapley values.</description>

Abstract: Using effective Lagrangians constrained by the heavy quark spin symmetry and chiral symmetry, for the light quarks, we analyze the $D^0 D^0\pi^+$, $\bar{D}^0D^0\pi^0$ and $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ invariant mass spectra. Performing a simultaneous analysis of the doubly charmed and charm-anti-charm states gives further insights into the nature of the $T^+_{cc}$ and $\chi^0_{c1}(3872)$, exotic hadrons. It is confirmed that both states should lie below their respective $DD^*$/$D\bar{D}^*$ thresholds. Also, the contributions of the triangle and box diagrams are negligible.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theoretical analysis of the experimental data by Ichikawa et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 071101 (2014)) on a spatial distribution of ultracold neutrons in the gravitational field of the Earth above a mirror, projected onto a pixelated detector by scattering by a cylindrical mirror. We calculate a theoretical spatial distribution of a probability density of quantum gravitational states of ultracold neutrons and analyse a spatial distribution of quantum gravitational states in term of the Wigner function. We cannot confirm that the experimental data by Ichikawa et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 071101 (2014)) correspond to a spatial distribution of quantum gravitational states of ultracold neutrons.</description>

      <title>Dual symmetries of dense three and two-color QCD and some QCD-like NJL models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the symmetry properties of the phase diagram of dense quark matter composed of $u$ and $d$ quarks with two or three colors has been investigated in the framework of massless (3+1)-dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) and QCD models. It turns out that in the presence of baryon $\mu_B$, isospin $\mu_I$, chiral $\mu_5$ and chiral isospin $\mu_{I5}$ chemical potentials the Lagrangians of these models are invariant under the so-called dual transformations. Consequently, the entire NJL model (or QCD) thermodynamic potentials are dually symmetric. In particular, it means that in the total $(\mu_B,\mu_I,\mu_5,\mu_{I5})$-phase portraits of these models the chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) and charged pion condensation (PC) phases are arranged dually conjugated (or symmetrical) to each other (in the case of three-color models). Whereas in the case of two-color quark matter, these models predict the entire phase structure in which there are dual symmetries between CSB, charged PC and baryon superfluid phases.</description>

      <title>Approximate SU(5), Fine Structure Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We fit the three finestructure constants of the Standard Model with three, in first approximation theoretically estimable parameters, 1) a "unifiedscale",turning out not equal to the Planck scale and thus only estimable by a very speculative story, 2) a "number of layers" being a priori the number of families, and 3) a unified coupling related to a critical coupling on a lattice. So formally we postdict the three fine structure constants! In the philosophy of our model there is a physically lattice theory with link variables taking values in a (or in the various) "small" representations of the Standard Model Group. We argue for that these representations functio in first approximation as were the theory a genuine $SU(5)$ theory. Next we take into account fluctuation of the gauge fields in the lattice and obtain a correction to the a priori $SU(5)$ approximation, because of course the link fluctuations not corresponding any Standard model Lie algebra, but only to the SU(5), do not exist. The model is a development of our old anti-grand-unification model having as its genuine gauge group, close to fundamental scale, a cross product of the standard model group S(U(3)x U(2)) with itself, there being one Cartesian product factor for each family. In these old works we included the hypotesis of "multiple point criticallity principle" which here effectively means the coupling constants be critical on the lattice. Counted relative to the Higgs scale we suggest the in our sense "unified scale" (where the deviations between the inverse fine structure constants deviate by quantum fluctuations being only from standard model groups, not SU(5)) makes up the 2/3 th power of the Planck scale relative to the Higgs scale, or better the top quark mass scale.</description>

      <title>Potential of light-cone sum rules without semiglobal quark-hadron duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the calculation of local form factors involved in the theoretical predictions of semileptonic $B$-meson decays at low $q^2$. We present a new approach to the method of QCD light-cone sum rule with $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes. In our strategy, we bypass the semiglobal quark-hadron duality (QHD) approximation which usually contributes an unknown and potentially large systematic error to the prediction of form factors. We trade this improvement for an increased reliance on higher-order contributions in perturbation theory. Unlike the systematic error from semiglobal QHD, truncation errors are assessable and systematically improvable, hence allowing robust predictions of form factors. For the transitions $B\to \pi,\rho,K^{(*)}$, our predictions agree with the literature for all form factors at $q^2=0$.</description>

      <title>Flavor phenomenology of an extended 2HDM with inverse seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed and comprehensive study of several flavor physics observables in both lepton and quark sectors within the framework of an extended 2HDM theory where the inverse seesaw mechanism is implemented to generate the SM fermion mass hierarchy. In that theory, the SM gauge symmetry is supplemented by the local $U(1)_X$ and discrete $Z_4\times Z_2$ groups. In particular, we find that the leptonic flavor observables specifically, the branching ratios of LFV decays $\mu\to e\gamma, \tau\to e(\mu)\gamma$ and the anomalous magnetic moments $\Delta a_{e(\mu)}$ strongly depend on the couplings of the neutral CP even(odd) Higgses with exotic charged lepton $E_1$, whereas other observables involving BR($l\to 3l'$), Mu-$\overline{\text{Mu}}$ transition and coherent conversion $\mu \to e $ in a muonic atom are predicted to be less than several orders of magnitude compared to the corresponding experimental limits. Regarding the quark sector, the most stringent limits arising from the FCNC process involving the down-type quark $d_a\to d_b$ ($a=1,2,3$) transitions such as BR($\bar{B}\to X_s \gamma$), BR$(B_s\to \mu^+\mu^-)$, and meson mixing $ \Delta m_{K,B_s, B_d}$. Considering the obtained constraints from these observables, the new physics contributions to other observables namely BR$(B_s\to \tau^+\mu^-)$, BR$(B^+\to K^+\tau^+\tau^-)$, BR$(B^+\to K^+\tau^+\mu^-)$, and FCCC $b\to c$ transition LFUV ratios $R_{D^{(*)}}$ are shown to be remarkably small. Regarding the observables in the up-type quark transitions, the FCNC top quark processes $t\to u(c)\gamma$ and $t\to u(c)h$ have branching ratios consistent with the experimental limits. Additionally, observables related to SM-like Higgs boson decays BR$(h\to \bar{l}'l)$ and modified couplings $a_{h\bar{f}f}$ are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an effective theory for a shift-symmetric, quadratically-coupled, ultralight spin-0 field. The leading CP-conserving interactions with Standard Model fields in the effective theory arise at dimension 8. We discuss the renormalization group evolution and positivity bounds on these operators, as well as their possible UV origins. Assuming that the spin-0 field is associated with an ultralight dark matter candidate, we discuss the effects of the dimension-8 operators on experiments searching for the oscillation of fundamental constants and Lorentz violation. We find that the direct bounds on these two effects are of similar strength but rather weak, corresponding to a UV cutoff scale of keV order, as they are mediated by dimension-8 operators.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication for nanohertz pulsar timing array signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: Using tremendous photon statistics gained with the stray light aperture of the NuSTAR telescope over 11 years of operation, we set strong limits on the emission of close to monochromatic photons from the radiative decays of putative dark matter sterile neutrinos in the Milky Way. In the energy range of 3-20 keV covered by the NuSTAR, the obtained limits reach the bottom edge of theoretical predictions of realistic models where sterile neutrinos are produced in the early Universe. Only a small region is left to explore, if the sterile neutrinos form the entire dark matter component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of the quark quasifragmentation function (qFF) using an equal-time and spatially boosted form of the Collins-Soper fragmentation function where the out-meson fragment is replaced by the current asymptotic condition. We derive the qFF for a fermion in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED2) using the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian after a mapping onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. This form is suitable for quantum computations. We compute the qFF by exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. The results are compared to the qFF following from the Drell-Levy-Yan result for QED2, both at strong and weak coupling, and to two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics in the lowest Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous detection of high energy vortex states via the superkick effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex states of photons, electrons, and other particles are freely propagating wave packets with helicoidal wave fronts winding around the axis of a phase vortex. A particle prepared in a vortex state carries a non-zero orbital angular momentum projection on the propagation direction, a quantum number that has never been exploited in experimental particle and nuclear physics. Low-energy vortex photons, electrons, neutrons, and helium atoms have been demonstrated in experiment and found numerous applications, and there exist proposals of boosting them to higher energies. However, verification that a high energy particle is indeed in a vortex state will be a major challenge, since the low energy techniques become impractical at higher energies. Here, we propose a new diagnostic method based of the so-called superkick effect, which can unambiguously detect the presence of a phase vortex. A proof-of-principle experiment with vortex electrons can be done with existing technology, and its realization will also constitute the first observation of the superkick effect.</description>

      <title>Probing self-interacting ultrahigh-energy neutrinos with the cosmic 21-cm signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the constraints on secret self-interactions of neutrinos by examining the impact of radiative scattering of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos. These neutrinos are produced from the decay of superheavy dark matter and interact with the cosmic neutrino background. We explore how these interactions influence the 21-cm hydrogen signal during the cosmic dark ages and cosmic dawn, periods relatively free from astrophysical uncertainties, providing a clearer signal for studying nonstandard neutrino interactions. By analyzing the global brightness temperature measurements, we constrain the scattering cross section of ultrahigh-energy self-interacting neutrinos, determining the coupling constant $g$ to be within $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}$ for neutrino energies in the PeV to EeV range. Interestingly, these constraints are more competitive than those from existing astrophysical and collider experiments. As future 21-cm experiments focus on measuring brightness temperature across a wide range of redshifts from the cosmic dark ages to reionization, using the epoch of 21-cm to probe neutrino properties could provide crucial insights into dark matter and neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Dark matter for Majorana neutrinos in a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the minimal Scotogenic model with fermionic dark matter, the neutrino Yukawa matrix is fine-tuned to satisfy current bounds on $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ while producing dark matter through thermal freeze-out. One way to avoid this bound is to open a new annihilation channel for dark matter (DM) with a scalar field that breaks the lepton number spontaneously. This introduces a physical Goldstone boson $a$, which can constitute a light relic and opens up the lepton flavor violating channel $\mu\rightarrow e a$. In this work, we introduce a model that contains the new annihilation channel for fermionic dark matter but avoids the introduction of the Goldstone boson by using a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ instead of a continuous symmetry. In this way, cosmological constraints on the light relic and experimental limits on lepton flavor violating decays to the Goldstone boson are avoided. We analyze the experimental viability of the model, identifying the region of parameter space where lepton flavor violating constraints are not saturated, DM has the correct relic density, and DM direct detection experiments are sensitive to the DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Search for ultralight dark matter in the SuperMAG high-fidelity dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter, such as kinetically mixed dark-photon dark matter (DPDM) or axionlike-particle dark matter (axion DM), can source an oscillating magnetic-field signal at Earth's surface. Previous work searched for this signal in a publicly available dataset of global magnetometer measurements maintained by the SuperMAG collaboration. This ``low-fidelity" dataset reported measurements with a 1-minute time resolution, allowing the search to set leading direct constraints on DPDM and axion DM with Compton frequencies $f_\mathrm{DM}\leq1/(1\,\mathrm{min})$ [corresponding to masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\leq7\times10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV}$]. More recently, a dedicated experiment undertaken by the SNIPE Hunt collaboration has also searched for this same signal at higher frequencies $f_\mathrm{DM}\geq0.5\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $m_\mathrm{DM}\geq2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). In this work, we search for this signal of ultralight DM in the SuperMAG ``high-fidelity" dataset, which features a 1-second time resolution, allowing us to probe the gap in parameter space between the low-fidelity dataset and the SNIPE Hunt experiment. The high-fidelity dataset exhibits lower geomagnetic noise than the low-fidelity dataset and features more data than the SNIPE Hunt experiment, making it a powerful probe of ultralight DM. Our search finds no robust DPDM or axion DM candidates. We set constraints on DPDM and axion DM parameter space for $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Hz}\leq f_\mathrm{DM}\leq0.98\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $4\times10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}\leq m_\mathrm{DM}\leq4\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$). Our results are the leading direct constraints on both DPDM and axion DM in this mass range, and our DPDM constraint surpasses the leading astrophysical constraint in a narrow range around $m_{A'}\approx2\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Theoretical implications for a new measurement of $K_L\to \pi^0 \ell\ell$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kaon physics is at an important experimental juncture with respect to the ongoing measurements of several observables. This work will build on the existing status by formulating different phenomenological analyses corresponding to different paths that may lie ahead. Beginning with the golden channels, $K^+\rightarrow\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ and $K_L\rightarrow\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$, the paper will eventually cast the spotlight on the importance of a precise measurement of BR($K_L\rightarrow\pi^0\ell\bar\ell$). The phenomenological analyses involve sequentially adding kaon physics observables at the projected final precision of their respective measurements to the global fit. More specifically, we consider three different scenarios with different sets of observables assumed at their final precisions. Beginning with BR($K^+\rightarrow\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$) and BR($K_L\rightarrow\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$), we sequentially add BR($K_L\rightarrow\pi^0 e\bar e$) and BR($K_L\rightarrow\pi^0 \mu\bar\mu$) to the global fit. The evolution of the result from one scenario to the next makes a strong case for the consideration of future measurement of BR($K_L\rightarrow\pi^0\ell\bar\ell$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses, the fine-structure splitting, and two-photon decay widths of the higher $nP$-charmonium states are calculated in the relativistic string model, reduced to the spinless Salpeter equation, where the static potential has no fitting parameters and the $c-$quark mass has the physical value. The resulting masses of $h_c(3P)$, $\chi_{c1}(3P)$, $\chi_{c0}(4P)$, $\chi_{c0}(5P)$, $\chi_{c1}(5P)$ are obtained in a good agreement with the experimental masses of the LHCb resonances: $h_c(4300)$, $\chi_{c1}(4274)$, $X(4500)$, $X(4700)$, $X(4685)$. To test sensitivity of results to a chosen gluon-exchange (GE) potential, three types of $V_{ge}(r)$ are considered. In first case the non-screened GE potential with large vector coupling at asymptotic, $\alpha_{\rm V}(\rm asym.)=0.635$, and the $c$-quark mass $m_c=1.430$ GeV are taken; in second case a screened $V_{ge}$ and $m_c=1.385$ are investigated, and in third case the GE potential is totally suppressed, $V_{ge}=0$, and $m_c=1.32$ GeV. The agreement with experiment is reached only if the same (universal) flattened confining potential, introduced in the analysis of the radial Regge trajectories of light mesons, is used. The unobserved $6P,0^+$ resonance with the mass $\cong 4.81$ GeV, near $J/\psi\phi(1680)$ threshold, is predicted. Our analysis shows that the screening of the GE potential is possible but weakly affects the physical results obtained. The calculated two-photon decay widths weakly differ in the three cases but may become an important factor, which distinguishes $c\bar c$ and four-quark states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the latest LHCb data on the $\pi^+\pi^-$ spectrum in the isospin-violating $X(3872)\to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ decay, based on dispersion theory to deal with the $\pi\pi$ final state interactions. Additionally, the isospin breaking effects are properly introduced, allowing for a reliable and accurate extraction of the ratio, $R_X$, between the $X(3872)$ couplings to the $J/\psi \rho$ and $J/\psi \omega$ channels from the data. We find very good agreement with the LHCb data for the whole range of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass, and $R_X$ is determined to be {$0.26\pm 0.03$}. Using this value, we make predictions for the $\pi^+\pi^0\pi^-$ mass distribution in the $X(3872)\to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^0\pi^-$ process, which is currently accessible by the BESIII Collaboration, and update a prediction for the pole positions of the isovector partner states of the $X(3872)$, $W_{c1}$, with $I(J^{PC})=1(1^{++})$.</description>

Abstract: Light scalar fields are frequently used in modern physics, for example, as candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Open quantum dynamical effects, like frequency shifts, induced by such fields in probe particles used in interferometry experiments might open up new perspectives for constraining such models. In this article, we consider a probe scalar particle as a rough approximation for an atom in matter wave interferometry and discuss the frequency shifts induced by interactions with an environment comprising either one of two screened scalar field models: chameleons or symmetrons. For the $n=-4$ chameleon, we revise a previously obtained expression for the induced frequency shift, but confirm that it can likely not be used to obtain new constraints. However, for symmetrons, we find that induced frequency shifts have the potential to tightly constrain previously unreachable parts of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Properties of Double-Strangeness Molecular Tetraquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in the study of the $K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ molecular tetraquarks and the $H$-dibaryon, we focus on the spectroscopic properties of the $\bar K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ systems, which exhibit exotic flavor quantum number of $ss\bar q \bar q$. A dynamical analysis is performed using the one-boson-exchange model to describe the effective interactions for these systems, accounting for both $S$-$D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. By solving the coupled-channel Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation, we identify the $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K \bar K^*$ and $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K^* \bar K^*$ states as the most likely candidates for double-strangeness molecular tetraquarks. Furthermore, we estimate their strong decay behaviors based on the effective Lagrangian approach, with several channels exhibiting considerable decay widths. Meanwhile, we investigate their magnetic moments and M1 radiative decay widths, shedding light on their inner structures, within the constituent quark model. Finally, we encourage experimentalists to focus on these predicted double-strangeness molecular tetraquark candidates, particularly in $B$ meson decays. Such efforts could pave the way for establishing the molecular tetraquark states in the light-quark sector.</description>

      <title>Effect of chiral imbalance on the electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter using Green-Kubo Method within the 2-flavour gauged NJL model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter is calculated using the 2-flavour gauged Nambu-Jona--Lasinio (NJL) model in the presence of a chiral imbalance quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP). To this end, the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the vector current correlator is evaluated employing the real time formulation of finite temperature field theory. Taking the long wavelength limit of the spectral function we extract the electrical conductivity using the Green-Kubo relation. The thermal widths of the quarks/antiquarks that appear in the expression of electrical conductivity are calculated by considering the $2\to2$ scattering in the NJL model. The scattering amplitudes containing the polarization functions of the mesonic modes in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels are also evaluated by considering finite value of CCP. We find that the ratio of electrical conductivity to temperature has significant dependence on CCP especially in the low temperature region.</description>

      <title>Looking into the quantum entanglement in $H\to ZZ^\star$ at LHC within SMEFT framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $H\to ZZ^\star$ production process in final four lepton states at $13$ TeV LHC in SMEFT framework. The anomalous $HZZ$ couplings are parameterized with dimension-6 $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ gauge invariant operators. We compute the eight polarizations of each $Z$ boson and $64$ spin-correlations as asymmetries in angular functions of final decayed leptons in the rest frame of the $Z$ boson. These asymmetries are further used to construct the joint density matrix (DM) for $ZZ^\star$ system. However, such DM suffers from negative probability and eigenvalues. To alleviate the negativity issues, we reconstruct the DM using asymmetries of symmetrized angular functions owing to the indistinguishability of two $Z$ bosons. The symmetrized DM is further employed to compute lower bound for concurrence as a witness of entanglement measurable at the collider experiments. The $ZZ^\star$ system is found to be in an entangled state for all values of the anomalous couplings. Notably, while the lower bound exhibits poorer sensitivity to anomalous couplings compared to asymmetries, it demonstrates distinct behavior for CP-even and odd couplings.</description>

Abstract: We present analytic results on physical kinematics for four integral families that are relevant to the production of two off-shell vector bosons with different masses. Our study consists of a ladder-box, a tennis-court, and two reducible ladder-box-like families. The results for the master integrals of these families are expressed up to order six in the dimensional regulator in terms of real-valued multiple polylogarithms. Furthermore, a semi-numeric solution is provided, employing generalized power series expansions using the package DiffExp.</description>

      <title>Feebly-Interacting Peccei-Quinn Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion is widely studied as a dark matter (DM) candidate and as a solution to the strong CP problem of the Standard Model. In conventional field-theoretic models, a much larger mass scale than the electroweak (EW) scale is typically introduced to spontaneously break Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry with a large enough axion decay constant, $f_a$, thereby avoiding constraints from star cooling. In this paper, I propose an alternative approach to achieving the large decay constant: a PQ scalar field with a large wave function renormalization constant, analogous to a feebly coupled gauge theory. Other dimensionless parameters are ${O}(1)$ in the unit of the EW scale for the naturalness. This framework predicts a light PQ Higgs boson with a mass $\sim (\mathrm{EW~scale})^2 / f_a$. Exotic particles associated with the PQ anomaly are expected to have masses around the EW scale. The proposed model alleviates both the PQ quality and EW scale fine-tuning problems and introduces interesting axion-PQ Higgs cosmologies, encompassing: slim axion DM from a fat string network, heavy axion DM from PQ Higgs condensate fragmentation, PQ Higgs DM, and axion-PQ Higgs co-DM scenarios. Potential experimental signatures are explored, including fifth-force tests, DM detections, accelerator searches, and gravitational wave observations by employing lattice simulation. Possible extensions of the scenario are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Thin accretion disk and shadow of Kerr-Sen black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thin disk and shadow of Kerr-Sen black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion gravity. The results reveal that as the dilaton parameter $r_2$ increase, the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the spectra luminosity, and the radiative efficiency of the disk all increase. By narrowing down the dilaton parameter range to $0\leqslant \frac{r_2}{M}\leqslant0.4$, we discover that in the high-frequency region, the Kerr-Sen black hole demonstrates higher energy output compared to the Kerr black hole. We also investigated the shadow of Kerr-Sen black hole in a uniform plasma environment. For fixed inclination angle, dilaton, and spin parameters, the shadow increases as the homogeneous plasma parameter $k$ increases. Conversely, when $k $ and $a$ are fixed, an increase in $r_2$ leads to a decrease in the shadow. Finally, we constrain the model parameters with observational data from M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>The Tropical Geometry of Subtraction Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the construction of local subtraction schemes through the lenses of tropical geometry. We focus on individual Feynman integrals in parametric presentation, and think of them as particular instances of Euler integrals. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a combination of Euler integrands to be locally finite, i.e. to be expandable as a Taylor series in the exponent variables directly under sign of integration. We use this to construct a local subtraction scheme that is applicable to a class of Euler integrals that satisfy a certain geometric property. We apply this to compute the Laurent expansion in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$ of various Feynman integrals involving both UV and IR singularities, as well as to generalizations of Feynman integrals that arise in effective field theories and in phase-space integrations, for which we provide new analytic results.</description>

      <title>Study of primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ with the cross-correlations between the scalar-induced gravitational waves and the cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formalism for Bose excitations in a plasma with a non-Abelian interaction II: Plasmon - hard particle scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the Hamiltonian formalism proposed previously in [1] to describe the nonlinear dynamics of only {\it soft} fermionic and bosonic excitations contains much more information than initially assumed. In this paper, we have demonstrated in detail that it also proved to be very appropriate and powerful in describing a wide range of other physical phenomena, including the scattering of colorless plasmons off {\it hard} thermal (or external) color-charged particles moving in hot quark-gluon plasma. A generalization of the Poisson superbracket including both anticommuting variables for hard modes and normal variables of the soft Bose field, is presented for the case of a continuous medium. The corresponding Hamilton equations are defined, and the most general form of the third- and fourth-order interaction Hamiltonians is written out in terms of the normal boson field variables and hard momentum modes of the quark-gluon plasma. The canonical transformations involving both bosonic and hard mode degrees of freedom of the system under consideration, are discussed. The canonicity conditions for these transformations based on the Poisson superbracket, are derived. The most general structure of canonical transformations in the form of integro-power series up to sixth order in a new normal field variable and a new hard mode variable, is presented. For the hard momentum mode of quark-gluon plasma excitations, an ansatz separating the color and momentum degrees of freedom, is proposed. The question of approximation of the total effective scattering amplitude when the momenta of hard excitations are much larger than those of soft excitations of the plasma, is considered.</description>
