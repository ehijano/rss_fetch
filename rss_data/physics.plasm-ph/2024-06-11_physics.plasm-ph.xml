      <title>Highly Polarized Energetic Electrons via Intense Laser-Irradiated Tailored Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for the generation of ultrarelativistic electron beams with high spin polarization is put forward, where a tightly-focused linearly-polarized ultraintense laser pulse interacts with a nonprepolarized transverse-size-tailored solid target. The radiative spin polarization and angular separation is facilitated by the standing wave formed via the incident and reflected laser pulses at the overdense plasma surface. Strong electron heating caused by transverse instability enhances photon emission in the density spikes injected into the standing wave near the surface. Two groups of electrons with opposite transverse polarization emerge, anti-aligned to the magnetic field, which are angularly separated in the standing wave due to the phase-matched oscillation of the magnetic field and the vector potential. The polarized electrons propelled into the plasma slab, are focused at the exit by the self-generated quasistatic fields. Our particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate the feasibility of highly polarized electrons with a single 10 PW laser beam, e.g. with polarization of 60% and charge of 8 pC selected at energy of 200 MeV within 15 mrad angle and 10% energy spread.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear saturation of reversed shear Alfven eigenmode via high-frequency quasi-mode generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear saturation mechanism for reversed shear Alfven eigenmode (RSAE) is proposed and analysed, and is shown to be of relevance to typical reactor parameter region. The saturation is achieved through the generation of high-frequency quasi-mode due to nonlinear coupling of two RSAEs, which is then damped due to coupling with the shear Alfven continuum, and leads to the nonlinear saturation of the primary RSAEs . An estimation of the nonlinear damping rate is also provided.</description>

      <title>Simulation Models for Exploring Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations have played a critical role in the advancement of our knowledge of magnetic reconnection. However, due to the inherently multiscale nature of reconnection, it is impossible to simulate all physics at all scales. For this reason, a wide range of simulation methods have been crafted to study particular aspects and consequences of magnetic reconnection. This chapter reviews many of these methods, laying out critical assumptions, numerical techniques, and giving examples of scientific results. Plasma models described include magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), Hall MHD, Hybrid, kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC), kinetic Vlasov, Fluid models with embedded PIC, Fluid models with direct feedback from energetic populations, and the Rice Convection Model (RCM).</description>

      <title>Plasma stratification in AC discharges in noble gases at low currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid kinetic-fluid model is used to study plasma stratification in alternating current (AC) discharges in noble gases at low plasma densities. Self-consistent coupled solutions of a non-local kinetic equation for electrons, a drift-diffusion equation of ions, and a Poisson equation for the electric field are obtained for a positive column with periodic boundary conditions and for the entire discharge to study near-electrode effects within a 1d model with radial ambipolar loss. A simplified two-level excitation-ionization model neglects the nonlinear effects due to stepwise ionization, gas heating, and Coulomb interactions among electrons. Standing striations are obtained for the reduced values of electric fields corresponding to the inelastic energy balance of electrons in a range of driving frequencies. An analog of Novak law (striation length proportional to the excitation threshold of atoms and inversely proportional to the mean square root of the electric field) is observed in simulations, indicating the nonlocal nature of standing striations in AC discharges at low plasma densities. Stratified plasma operates in a dynamic regime for a wide range of driving frequencies because heat conduction occurs much faster than the ambipolar diffusion controlled by slow ion motion. We demonstrate that standing striations in symmetric AC discharges previously observed in experiments are similar to moving striations in DC discharges and are both due to nonlocal kinetic effects at low discharge currents.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Structure of the Guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell Equations with Polarization and Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian formulation of guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell equations, which contain dipole contributions to the guiding-center polarization and magnetization, is presented in terms of a guiding-center Hamiltonian functional that is derived from the exact guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell energy conservation law, and an antisymmetric functional bracket that satisfies the Jacobi property. Exact energy-momentum and angular momentum conservation laws are expressed in Hamiltonian form and the guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell entropy functional is shown to be a Casimir functional.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Enhancement of Tritium Burn Efficiency and Fusion Power with Low-Tritium Spin-Polarized Fuel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that using spin-polarized deuterium-tritium (D-T) fuel with more deuterium than tritium can increase tritium burn efficiency (TBE) by at least an order of magnitude without compromising fusion power output, compared to unpolarized fuel. Although previous studies show that a low tritium fraction can enhance TBE, this strategy resulted in reduced fusion power density. The surprising improvement in TBE at fixed power reported here is due to the TBE increasing nonlinearly with decreasing tritium fraction but the fusion power density increasing roughly linearly with D-T cross section. A study is performed for an ARC-like tokamak producing 482 MW of fusion power with unpolarized 51:49 D-T fuel, finding the minimum startup tritium inventory ($I_{\mathrm{startup,min}}$) is 0.69 kg. By spin-polarizing half of the fuel and using a 57:43 D-T mix, $I_{\mathrm{startup,min}}$ is reduced to 0.08 kg, and fully spin-polarizing the fuel with a 61:39 D-T mix further reduces $I_{\mathrm{startup,min}}$ to 0.03 kg. Some ARC-like scenarios could achieve plasma ignition with relatively modest spin polarization. These findings indicate that, with advancements in helium divertor pumping efficiency, TBE values of approximately 10-40% could be achieved using low-tritium-fraction and spin-polarized fuel with minimal power loss. This would dramatically lower tritium startup inventory requirements and reduce the amount of on-site tritium. More generally than just for spin-polarized fuels, high plasma performance can be used to increase TBE. This strongly motivates the development of spin-polarized fuels and low-tritium-fraction operation for burning plasmas.</description>

      <title>Plasma screening in mid-charged ions observed by K-shell line emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense plasma environment affects the electronic structure of ions via variations of the microscopic electrical fields, also known as plasma screening. This effect can be either estimated by simplified analytical models, or by computationally expensive and to date unverified numerical calculations. We have experimentally quantified plasma screening from the energy shifts of the bound-bound transitions in matter driven by the x-ray free electron laser (XFEL). This was enabled by identification of detailed electronic configurations of the observed K{\alpha}, K\b{eta} and K{\gamma} lines. This work paves the way for improving plasma screening models including connected effects like ionization potential depression and continuum lowering, which will advance the understanding of atomic physics in Warm Dense Matter regime.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the autoresonant plasma wave excitation in two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of an autoresonantly phase-locked high amplitude plasma waves to the chirped beat frequency of two driving lasers is studied in two dimensions using particle-in-cell simulations. The two-dimensional plasma and laser parameters correspond to those that optimized the plasma wave amplitude in one-dimensional simulations. Near the start of autoresonant locking, the two-dimensional simulations appear similar to one-dimensional particle-in-cell results [Luo et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 013338 (2024)] with plasma wave amplitudes above the Rosenbluth-Liu limit. Later, just below wave-breaking, the two-dimensional simulation exhibits a Weibel-like instability and eventually laser beam filamentation. These limit the coherence of the plasma oscillation after the peak plasma wave field is obtained. In spite of the reduction of spatial coherence of the accelerating density structure, the acceleration of self-injected electrons in the case studied remains at $70\%$ to $80\%$ of that observed in one dimension. Other effects such as plasma wave bowing are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06396v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on attosecond-scale control of high-harmonic and electron emission from plasma mirrors driven by relativistic-intensity near-single-cycle lightwaves at kHz repetition rate. By controlling the waveform of the intense light transient, we reproducibly form a sub-cycle temporal intensity gate at the plasma mirror surface, leading to the observation of extreme ultraviolet spectral continua, characteristic of isolated attosecond pulse generation. We also observe the correlated emission of a waveform-dependent relativistic electron beam, paving the way towards fully lightwave-controlled dynamics of relativistic plasma mirrors.</description>

      <title>Prevalence of non-standard collapsing of strong Langmuir turbulence in solar corona plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully-kinetic simulation of the full life cycle of strong Langmuir turbulence (SLT) excited by electron beams that are accelerated under the solar corona conditions. We find that (1) most packets ($\sim$80%) are affected by their neighbors during their collapse, as a result, their spatial scale variations present non-standard evolutionary features, i.e., deviating away from what was predicted by the Zakharov model; (2) the collapsing cavity is too shallow to trap the wave packet due to the growth of the Coulomb force, as a result a majority ($\sim$70%) of the packet energy runs away and a secondary localization may occur. The study indicates that the non-standard Langmuir collapse may play an important role in coronal plasmas interacting with an intense electron beam, that may be eventually confirmed by humanity's first mission to fly through the corona.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Energetic Electron Fluxes from 150 km to 20,000 km: an ELFIN-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong variations of energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's inner magnetosphere are notoriously hard to forecast. Developing accurate empirical models of electron fluxes from low to high altitudes at all latitudes is therefore useful to improve our understanding of flux variations and to assess radiation hazards for spacecraft systems. In the present work, energy- and pitch-angle-resolved precipitating, trapped, and backscattered electron fluxes measured at low altitude by Electron Loss and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) CubeSats are used to infer omnidirectional fluxes at altitudes below and above the spacecraft, from 150 km to 20,000 km, making use of adiabatic transport theory and quasi-linear diffusion theory. The inferred fluxes are fitted as a function of selected parameters using a stepwise multivariate optimization procedure, providing an analytical model of omnidirectional electron flux along each geomagnetic field line, based on measurements from only one spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The modeled electron fluxes are provided as a function of L-shell, altitude, energy, and two different indices of past geomagnetic activity, computed over the preceding 4 hours or 3 days, potentially allowing to disentangle impulsive processes (such as rapid injections) from cumulative processes (such as inward radial diffusion and wave-driven energization). The model is validated through comparisons with equatorial measurements from the Van Allen Probes, demonstrating the broad applicability of the present method. The model indicates that both impulsive and time-integrated geomagnetic activity partly control electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt and in the plasma sheet.</description>

      <title>A detailed survey of the parallel mean free path of solar energetic particle protons and electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, more than a dozen solar energetic particle (SEP) events are identified where the source region is magnetically well-connected to at least one spacecraft at 1~au. The observed intensity-time profiles, for all available proton and electron energy channels, are compared to results computed using a numerical 1D SEP transport model in order to derive the parallel mean free paths (pMFPs) as a function of energy (or rigidity) at 1~au. These inversion results are then compared to theoretical estimates of the pMFP, using observed turbulence quantities with observationally-motivated variations as input. For protons, a very good comparison between inversion and theoretical results is obtained. It is shown that the observed inter-event variations in the inversion pMFP values can be explained by natural variations in the background turbulence values. For electrons, there is relatively good agreement with pMFPs derived assuming the damping model of dynamical turbulence, although the theoretical values are extremely sensitive to the details of the turbulence dissipation range which themselves display a high level of variation.</description>

      <title>Study on Kelvin Helmholtz shear flows subjected to differential rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical simulation of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) in parallel shear flows subjected to external rotation is carried out using a pseudo-spectral technique. The Coriolis force, arising in a rotation frame under the beta plane approximation, tends to suppress the growth of KHI modes. The numerical results show a close qualitative agreement with the analytical results obtained for a step-wise shear flow profile. Experimental evidence demonstrates that particles in a rotating frame experience the Coriolis force, mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz force. Therefore, the Coriolis force affects fluid dynamics in a manner similar to the Lorentz force in magnetized shear flows. This paper exploits the analogy between the magnetic field and rotation to study effects equivalent to a magnetic field on KHI in a rotating frame. Similar to the magnetic field case, the Coriolis force suppresses KHI and tends to form compressed and elongated KH vortex structures. However, the magnetic field and Coriolis force act on different scales, with the latter suppressing long-wavelength mode perturbations. A higher number of vortices are observed in the presence of rotation compared to non-rotating cases</description>

      <title>Exploring the generation and annihilation of three dimensional nulls through MHD simulations in initially chaotic magnetic field devoid of nulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nulls are abundant in the solar atmosphere, as been firmly established through contemporary observations. They are established to be important magnetic structures in, for example, jets and circular ribbon flares. While simulations and extrapolations support this, the mechanisms behind 3D null generation remain an open question. Recent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations propose that magnetic reconnection is responsible for both generating and annihilating 3D nulls, a novel concept. However, these simulations began with initial magnetic fields already supporting pre-existing nulls, raising the question of whether magnetic reconnection can create nulls in fields initially devoid of them. Previously, this question was briefly explored in a simulation with an initial chaotic magnetic field. However, the study failed to precisely identify locations, topological degrees, and natures (spiral or radial) of nulls, and it approximated magnetic reconnection without fully tracking field line in time. In this paper these findings are revisited in light of recent advancements and tools used to locate and trace nulls, along with the tracing of field lines, through which the concept of generation/annihilation of 3D nulls from chaotic fields is established in a precise manner.</description>

      <title>ENN's Roadmap for Proton-Boron Fusion Based on Spherical Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ENN Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (ENN) is committed to generating fusion energy in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective manner, which requires abundant aneutronic fuel. Proton-boron ( p-$^{11}$B or p-B) fusion is considered an ideal choice for this purpose. Recent studies have suggested that p-B fusion, although challenging, is feasible based on new cross-section data, provided that a hot ion mode and high wall reflection can be achieved to reduce electron radiation loss. The high beta and good confinement of the spherical torus (ST) make it an ideal candidate for p-B fusion. By utilizing the new spherical torus energy confinement scaling law, a reactor with a major radius $R_0=4$ m, central magnetic field $B_0=6$ T, central temperature $T_{i0}=150$ keV, plasma current $I_p=30$ MA, and hot ion mode $T_i/T_e=4$ can yield p-B fusion with $Q&gt;10$. A roadmap for p-B fusion has been developed, with the next-generation device named EHL-2. EHL stands for ENN He-Long, which literally means ``peaceful Chinese Loong". The main target parameters include $R_0\simeq1.05$ m, $A\simeq1.85$, $B_0\simeq3$ T, $T_{i0}\simeq30$ keV, $I_p\simeq3$ MA, and $T_i/T_e\geq2$. The existing ST device EXL-50 was simultaneously upgraded to provide experimental support for the new roadmap, involving the installation and upgrading of the central solenoid, vacuum chamber, and magnetic systems. The construction of the upgraded ST fusion device, EXL-50U, was completed at the end of 2023, and it achieved its first plasma in January 2024. The construction of EHL-2 is estimated to be completed by 2026.</description>

Abstract: ITER coil tolerances are re-evaluated using the modern understanding of coupling to least-stable plasma modes and an updated center-line-traced model of ITER's coil windings. This reassessment finds the tolerances to be conservative through a statistical, linear study of $n=1$ error fields (EFs) due to tilted, shifted misplacements and nominal windings of central solenoid and poloidal field coils within tolerance. We also show that a model-based correction scheme remains effective even when metrology quality is sub-optimal, and compare this to projected empirical correction schemes. We begin with an analysis of the necessity of error field correction (EFC) for daily operation in ITER using scaling laws for the EF penetration threshold. We then consider the predictability of EF dominant mode overlap across early planned ITER scenarios and, as measuring EFs in high power scenarios can pose risks to the device, the potential for extrapolation to the ITER Baseline Scenario (IBS). We find that carefully designing a scenario matching currents proportionally to those of the IBS is far more important than plasma shape or profiles in accurately measuring an optimal correction current set.</description>
