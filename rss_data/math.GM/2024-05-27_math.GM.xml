      <title>Power of Continuous Triangular Norms with Application to Intuitionistic Fuzzy Information Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power operation of continuous Archimedean triangular norms (t-norms) is fundamental for generalizing the multiplication and power operations of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) within the framework of continuous Archimedean t-norms. However, due to the lack of systematic research on the power operation of general continuous t-norms in theory, it greatly limits the further generalization of the multiplication and power operations for IFSs via general continuous t-norms. This paper aims to investigate the power operation of continuous t-norms and develop some IF information aggregation methods. In theory, it is proved that a continuous t-norm is power stable if and only if every point is a power stable point, and if and only if it is the minimum t-norm, or it is strict, or it is an ordinal sum of strict t-norms. Moreover, the representation theorem of continuous t-norms is used to obtain the computational formula for the power of continuous t-norms. Based on the power operation of t-norms, four fundamental operations induced by a continuous t-norm for the IFSs are introduced. Furthermore, various IF aggregation operators based on these four fundamental operations, namely the IF weighted average (IFWA), IF weighted geometric (IFWG), and IF mean weighted average and geometric (IFMWAG) operators, are defined, and their properties are analyzed. In application, a new decision-making algorithm is designed based on the IFMWAG operator, which can remove the hindrance of indiscernibility on the boundaries of some classical aggregation operators. The practical applicability, comparative analysis, and advantages of the study with other decision-making methods are furnished to ascertain the efficacy of the designed method.</description>

      <title>New identities for the Laplace, Glasser, and Widder potential transforms and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we begin by applying the Laplace transform to derive closed forms for several challenging integrals that seem nearly impossible to evaluate. By utilizing the solution to the Pythagorean equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, these closed forms become even more intriguing. This method allows us to provide new integral representations for the error function. Following this, we use the Fourier transform to derive formulas for the Glasser and Widder potential transforms, leading to several new and interesting corollaries. As part of the applications, we demonstrate the use of one of these integral formulas to provide a new real analytic proof of Euler's reflection formula for the gamma function. Of particular interest is a generalized integral involving the Riemann zeta function, which we also present as an application.</description>
