      <title>Double Directional Wireless Channel Generation: A Statistics-Informed Generative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel models that represent various operating conditions a communication system might experience are important for design and standardization of any communication system. While statistical channel models have long dominated this space, machine learning (ML) is becoming a popular alternative approach. However, existing approaches have mostly focused on predictive solutions to match instantaneous channel realizations. Other solutions have focused on pathloss modeling, while double-directional (DD) channel representation is needed for a complete description. Motivated by this, we (a) develop a generative solution that uses a hybrid Transformer (hTransformer) model with a low-rank projected attention calculation mechanism and a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layer to generate complete DD channel information and (b) design a domain-knowledge-informed training method to match the generated and true channel realizations' statistics. Our extensive simulation results validate that the generated samples' statistics closely align with the true statistics while mostly outperforming the performance of existing predictive approaches.</description>

      <title>Sensing for Communication: RIS-Assisted ISAC Coordination Gain Enhancement With Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has the potential to facilitate coordination gains from mutual assistance between sensing and communication (S&amp;C), especially sensing-aided communication enhancement (SACE). Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is another potential technique for achieving resource-efficient communication enhancement. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative RIS-assisted SACE (R-SACE) mechanism with the goal of improving the systemic communication performance of the ISAC system in practical scenarios where the channel status information (CSI) is imperfectly known. In the proposed R-SACE mechanism, a dual-functional base station (BS) provides downlink communication services to both the communication user and the dynamically changing target that is detected using the communication signals. RIS assists in both sensing and communications of the BS. A typical scenario is investigated in which either or both the direct and RIS-assisted reflected communication links are available depending on sensing results. The average systemic throughput (AST) over the entire timeline of the R-SACE mechanism is maximized by jointly optimizing both temporal and spatial resources under the probabilistic constraint and the sensing performance, transmission power, and communication interference constraints. The non-convex probabilistic mixed optimization problem is transformed and then solved by the proposed fixed-point iterative (FPI) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FPI algorithm and R-SACE mechanism outperform the baseline algorithms and communication enhancement mechanisms in achieving higher systemic communication performance.</description>

      <title>mixEEG: Enhancing EEG Federated Learning for Cross-subject EEG Classification with Tailored mixup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) classification exhibits great challenges due to the diversity of cognitive processes and physiological structures between different subjects. Modern EEG models are based on neural networks, demanding a large amount of data to achieve high performance and generalizability. However, privacy concerns associated with EEG pose significant limitations to data sharing between different hospitals and institutions, resulting in the lack of large dataset for most EEG tasks. Federated learning (FL) enables multiple decentralized clients to collaboratively train a global model without direct communication of raw data, thus preserving privacy. For the first time, we investigate the cross-subject EEG classification in the FL setting. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework termed mixEEG. Specifically, we tailor the vanilla mixup considering the unique properties of the EEG modality. mixEEG shares the unlabeled averaged data of the unseen subject rather than simply sharing raw data under the domain adaptation setting, thus better preserving privacy and offering an averaged label as pseudo-label. Extensive experiments are conducted on an epilepsy detection and an emotion recognition dataset. The experimental result demonstrates that our mixEEG enhances the transferability of global model for cross-subject EEG classification consistently across different datasets and model architectures.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document serves as supplementary material for a journal paper submission, presenting detailed mathematical proofs and derivations that support the results outlined in the main manuscript. In this work, we formulate an Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) optimization problem aimed at fairly maximizing beampattern gains across multiple directions of interest, while ensuring that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for communication users and the overall power constraint are satisfied. To solve this problem, we propose an optimization algorithm and provide a formal proof of its convergence.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of Realistic EMF Exposure Estimation from Low Density Sensor Network by Finite &amp; Infinite Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of environmental exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) is essential for conducting risk assessments. These assessments aim to explore potential connections between RF-EMF exposure and its effects on human health, as well as on wildlife and plant life. Existing research has used different machine learning tools for EMF exposure estimation; however, a comparative analysis of these techniques is required to better understand their performance for real-world datasets. In this work, we present both finite and infinite-width convolutional network-based methods to estimate and assess EMF exposure levels from 70 real-world sensors in Lille, France. A comparative analysis has been conducted to analyze the performance of the methods' execution time and estimation accuracy. To improve estimation accuracy for higher-resolution grids, we utilized a preconditioned gradient descent method for kernel estimation. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used as the evaluation criterion for comparing the performance of these deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Towards Simple Machine Learning Baselines for GNSS RFI Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07993v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning research in GNSS radio frequency interference (RFI) detection often lacks a clear empirical justification for the choice of deep learning architectures over simpler machine learning approaches. In this work, we argue for a change in research direction-from developing ever more complex deep learning models to carefully assessing their real-world effectiveness in comparison to interpretable and lightweight machine learning baselines. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art deep learning models frequently fail to outperform simple, well-engineered machine learning methods in the context of GNSS RFI detection. Leveraging a unique large-scale dataset collected by the Swiss Air Force and Swiss Air-Rescue (Rega), and preprocessed by Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (Skyguide), we demonstrate that a simple baseline model achieves 91\% accuracy in detecting GNSS RFI, outperforming more complex deep learning counterparts. These results highlight the effectiveness of pragmatic solutions and offer valuable insights to guide future research in this critical application domain.</description>

      <title>Fusing Global and Local: Transformer-CNN Synergy for Next-Gen Current Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid model combining Transformer and CNN for predicting the current waveform in signal lines. Unlike traditional approaches such as current source models, driver linear representations, waveform functional fitting, or equivalent load capacitance methods, our model does not rely on fixed simplified models of standard-cell drivers or RC loads. Instead, it replaces the complex Newton iteration process used in traditional SPICE simulations, leveraging the powerful sequence modeling capabilities of the Transformer framework to directly predict current responses without iterative solving steps. The hybrid architecture effectively integrates the global feature-capturing ability of Transformers with the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs, significantly improving the accuracy of current waveform predictions.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional SPICE simulations, the proposed algorithm achieves an error of only 0.0098. These results highlight the algorithm's superior capabilities in predicting signal line current waveforms, timing analysis, and power evaluation, making it suitable for a wide range of technology nodes, from 40nm to 3nm.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Solar Spectral Irradiance Using Meteorological Data and Analysis of Optimal Conditions for Solar Power Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an approximate model to estimate the solar radiation spectrum intensity in Seoul, Republic of Korea, for the year 2024, aiming to analyze optimal conditions related to energy generation. Since the solar radiation spectrum varies with atmospheric conditions, accurately predicting it typically requires complex spectral radiation models. However, such models entail high computational costs, hindering real-time application. To address this, this study introduces a simplified approximation model using only direct normal irradiance (DNI) among real-time meteorological elements, employing linear scaling of the standard spectrum (ASTM G-173). This model first estimates DNI using global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and solar position information (such as zenith angle), then linearly adjusts the standard spectrum to compute real-time spectrum intensity. The model approximates realistic DNI values by correcting various meteorological parameters, including zenith angle, cloud cover, and visibility. The analysis shows that GHI exhibits stable seasonal patterns, peaking in summer and minimizing in winter. In contrast, DNI demonstrates significant temporal variability and frequent abnormal peaks (e.g., exceeding 9,000 W/m^2), highlighting the importance of data refinement and anomaly detection in predicting energy generation. In conclusion, GHI is suitable for general photovoltaic analyses, whereas DNI is crucial for direct-beam sensitive systems like concentrated solar power (CSP), requiring meticulous data quality management. Future research should focus on identifying the causes of DNI anomalies and developing real-time quality control algorithms.</description>

      <title>DL-AMC: Deep Learning for Automatic Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a signal processing technique widely used at the physical layer of wireless systems to enhance spectrum utilization efficiency. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate AMC system, termed DL-AMC, which leverages deep learning techniques. Specifically, DL-AMC is built using convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and MobileNetv2. To evaluate its performance, we curated a comprehensive dataset containing various modulation schemes. Each modulation type was transformed into an eye diagram, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values ranging from -20 dB to 30 dB. We trained the CNN models on this dataset to enable them to learn the discriminative features of each modulation class effectively. Experimental results show that the proposed DL-AMC models achieve high classification accuracy, especially in low SNR conditions. These results highlight the robustness and efficacy of DL-AMC in accurately classifying modulations in challenging wireless environments</description>

      <title>A Construction of Pairwise Co-prime Integer Matrices of Any Dimension and Their Least Common Right Multiple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared with co-prime integers, co-prime integer matrices are more challenging due to the non-commutativity. In this paper, we present a new family of pairwise co-prime integer matrices of any dimension and large size. These matrices are non-commutative and have low spread, i.e., their ratios of peak absolute values to mean absolute values (or the smallest non-zero absolute values) of their components are low. When matrix dimension is larger than $2$, this family of matrices differs from the existing families, such as circulant, Toeplitz matrices, or triangular matrices, and therefore, offers more varieties in applications. In this paper, we first prove the pairwise coprimality of the constructed matrices, then determine their determinant absolute values, and their least common right multiple (lcrm) with a closed and simple form. We also analyze their sampling rates when these matrices are used as sampling matrices for a multi-dimensional signal. The proposed family of pairwise co-prime integer matrices may have applications in multi-dimensional Chinese remainder theorem (MD-CRT) that can be used to determine integer vectors from their integer vector remainders modulo a set of integer matrix moduli, and also in multi-dimensional sparse sensing and multirate systems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Based CSI Reconstruction for Improved Wireless Security Through Channel Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reciprocity of channel state information (CSI) collected by two devices communicating over a wireless channel has been leveraged to provide security solutions to resource-limited IoT devices. Despite the extensive research that has been done on this topic, much of the focus has been on theoretical and simulation analysis. However, these security solutions face key implementation challenges, mostly pertaining to limitations of IoT hardware and variations of channel conditions, limiting their practical adoption. To address this research gap, we revisit the channel reciprocity assumption from an experimental standpoint using resource-constrained devices. Our experimental study reveals a significant degradation in channel reciprocity for low-cost devices due to the varying channel conditions. Through experimental investigations, we first identify key practical causes for the degraded channel reciprocity. We then propose a new wavelet-based CSI reconstruction technique using wavelet coherence and time-lagged cross-correlation to construct CSI data that are consistent between the two participating devices, resulting in significant improvement in channel reciprocity. Additionally, we propose a secret-key generation scheme that exploits the wavelet-based CSI reconstruction, yielding significant increase in the key generation rates. Finally, we propose a technique that exploits CSI temporal variations to enhance device authentication resiliency through effective detection of replay attacks.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Cooperative Localization: A Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative localization leverages noisy inter-node distance measurements and exchanged wireless messages to estimate node positions in a wireless network. In communication-constrained environments, however, transmitting large messages becomes problematic. In this paper, we propose an approach for communication-efficient cooperative localization that addresses two main challenges. First, cooperative localization often needs to be performed over wireless networks with loopy graph topologies. Second is the need for designing an algorithm that has low localization error while simultaneously requiring a much lower communication overhead. Existing methods fall short of addressing these two challenges concurrently. To achieve this, we propose a vector quantized message passing neural network (VQ-MPNN) for cooperative localization. Through end-to-end neural network training, VQ-MPNN enables the co-design of node localization and message compression. Specifically, VQ-MPNN treats prior node positions and distance measurements as node and edge features, respectively, which are encoded as node and edge states using a graph neural network. To find an efficient representation for the node state, we construct a vector quantized codebook for all node states such that instead of sending long messages, each node only needs to transmit a codeword index. Numerical evaluations demonstrates that our proposed VQ-MPNN approach can deliver localization errors that are similar to existing approaches while reducing the overall communication overhead by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Examining Different Placement Strategies for Indoor Environmental Quality Sensors in Office Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collecting Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) data from an occupant's immediate surroundings can provide personalized insights for healthy environmental conditions aligned with occupant preferences, but effective sensor placement for data accuracy and reliability has not been thoroughly explored. This paper explores various positioning of IEQ multi-sensing devices at individual workstations in typical office settings, aiming to identify sensor placements that most accurately reflect the environmental conditions experienced by occupants. We examined five unique positions close to an occupant (above and below the monitor, right side of the desk, ceiling, and chair backrest), two orientations, and three desk locations characterized by different lighting levels, thermal and airflow conditions. Data on temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matters (PM1, PM2.5, PM10), illuminance, and sound were collected over a 2-week longitudinal experiment, followed by short-term experiments simulating common pollution events such as coughing and sneezing. Principal Component Analysis, Spearman's rank correlation, R2, and Mean Absolute Error were applied to identify the position and orientation that best captures the most information and matches breathing zone measurements. It was found that above the monitor position, facing the occupant, best captures the IEQ conditions experienced by the occupant.</description>

      <title>General Theory of Coupled Characteristic Mode: An Eigen Subspace Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the problem of characteristic mode analysis using eigendecomposition of the method of moments impedance matrix has been simplified using the eigen-subspace approach. The idea behind the eigen-subspace arises from the physical properties of antenna or scatterers, where only a few eigenmodes are enough to characterize the antenna or scatterer. Therefore, entire space eigenanalysis is a waste of computational resources, and eigen-subspace analysis with few modes is good enough to characterize antennas and scatterers. It has been assumed that there is an eigen-subspace (or hyperplane) of coupled characteristic mode, which coincides with the eigen-hyperplane of uncoupled characteristic mode. We can say the coupled characteristic modes are linear combinations of isolated modes based on this assumption. The linear combination is mapped via modal coupling matrix. Using the modal coupling matrix, we can explain the behavior of arbitrarily shaped antennas and scatterers. A computationally efficient method is developed to compute coupled characteristic modes of two mutually coupled scatterers or antennas using the eigen-subspace. The method is summarized as a theorem of two-body coupled characteristic mode. The theorem of two-body coupled characteristic mode has been extended to the N-body coupled characteristic mode. Two algorithms have been developed for the two-body multimode coupled characteristic mode and N-body multimode coupled characteristic mode. Two numerical examples are provided to validate the proposed concepts.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the distributed Kalman filter (DKF) for linear systems, with specific attention on measurement fusion, which is a typical way of information sharing and is vital for enhancing stability and improving estimation accuracy. We show that it is the mismatch between the fused measurement and the fused covariance that leads to performance degradation or inconsistency in previous consensus-based DKF algorithms. To address this issue, we introduce two fully distributed approaches for calculating the exact covariance of the fused measurements, building upon which the modified DKF algorithms are proposed. Moreover, the performance analysis of the modified algorithms is also provided under rather mild conditions, including the steady-state value of the estimation error covariance. We also show that due to the guaranteed consistency in the modified DKF algorithms, the steady-state estimation accuracy is significantly improved compared to classical DKF algorithms. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis and show the advantages of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Fast Reconfiguration of LC-RISs: Modeling and Algorithm Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LC technology is a promising hardware solution for realizing extremely large RISs due to its advantages in cost-effectiveness, scalability, energy efficiency, and continuous phase shift tunability. However, the slow response time of the LC cells, especially in comparison to the silicon-based alternatives like radio frequency switches and PIN diodes, limits the performance. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in TDMA applications where RIS must sequentially serve users in different locations, as the phase-shifting response time of LC cells can constrain system performance. This paper addresses the slow phase-shifting limitation of LC by developing a physics-based model for the time response of an LC unit cell and proposing a novel phase-shift design framework to reduce the transition time. Specifically, exploiting the fact that LC-RIS at milimeter wave bands have a large electric aperture, we optimize the LC phase shifts based on user locations, eliminating the need for full channel state information and minimizing reconfiguration overhead. Moreover, instead of focusing on a single point, the RIS phase shifters are designed to optimize coverage over an area. This enhances communication reliability for mobile users and mitigates performance degradation due to user location estimation errors. The proposed design minimizes the transition time between configurations, a critical requirement for TDMA schemes. Our analysis reveals that the impact of RIS reconfiguration time on system throughput becomes particularly significant when TDMA intervals are comparable to the reconfiguration time. In such scenarios, optimizing the phase-shift design helps mitigate performance degradation while ensuring specific QoS requirements. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has been tested through experimental evaluations, which demonstrate that it also performs effectively in practice.</description>

      <title>Flip-KLJN: Random Resistance Flipping for Noise-Driven Secure Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information-theoretically (unconditionally) secure Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) bit exchange protocol uses two identical resistor pairs with high (H) and low (L) resistance values, driven by Gaussian noise generators emulating Johnson noise with a high common temperature. The resulting mean-square noise voltage on the wire connecting Alice and Bob has three levels: low (L/L), intermediate (H/L or L/H), and high (H/H), and secure key sharing is achieved at the intermediate level (L/H or H/L). This paper introduces the Flip-KLJN scheme, where a pre-agreed intermediate level, such as H/L, triggers a flip of the bit map value during the bit exchange period. For Eve, the bit map flips appear random. Thus, the formerly discarded H/H and L/L situations can also have a pre-agreed bit value mapping, which flips together with the original bit mapping. Thus, Flip-KLJN doubles the key rate and ensures that all three levels on the wire are indistinguishable for Eve. Bit error probabilities are addressed through analytic calculations and computer simulations.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Investigation of Reconstruction-Based Models for Seizure Prediction from ECG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epileptic seizures are sudden neurological disorders characterized by abnormal, excessive neuronal activity in the brain, which is often associated with changes in cardiovascular activity. These disruptions can pose significant physical and psychological challenges for patients. Therefore, accurate seizure prediction can help mitigate these risks by enabling timely interventions, ultimately improving patients' quality of life. Traditionally, EEG signals have been the primary standard for seizure prediction due to their precision in capturing brain activity. However, their high cost, susceptibility to noise, and logistical constraints limit their practicality, restricting their use to clinical settings. In order to overcome these limitations, this study focuses on leveraging ECG signals as an alternative for seizure prediction. In this paper, we present a novel method for predicting seizures based on detecting anomalies in ECG signals during their reconstruction. By extracting time-frequency features and leveraging various advanced deep learning architectures, the proposed method identifies deviations in heart rate dynamics associated with seizure onset. The proposed approach was evaluated using the Siena database and could achieve specificity of 99.16\%, accuracy of 76.05\%, and false positive rate (FPR) of 0.01/h, with an average prediction time of 45 minutes before seizure onset. These results highlight the potential of ECG-based seizure prediction as a patient-friendly alternative to traditional EEG-based methods.</description>

      <title>Statistical Linear Regression Approach to Kalman Filtering and Smoothing under Cyber-Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote state estimation in cyber-physical systems is often vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to wireless connections between sensors and computing units. In such scenarios, adversaries compromise the system by injecting false data or blocking measurement transmissions via denial-of-service attacks, distorting sensor readings. This paper develops a Kalman filter and Rauch--Tung--Striebel (RTS) smoother for linear stochastic state-space models subject to cyber-attacked measurements. We approximate the faulty measurement model via generalized statistical linear regression (GSLR). The GSLR-based approximated measurement model is then used to develop a Kalman filter and RTS smoother for the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under cyber-attacks is demonstrated through a simulated aircraft tracking experiment.</description>

      <title>Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter for trajectory measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for multi-target filtering based on sensor measurements that are sets of trajectories in the last two-time step window. The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose fully data-driven variational methods, termed successive jump and mode decomposition (SJMD) and its multivariate extension, successive multivariate jump and mode decomposition (SMJMD), for successively decomposing nonstationary signals into amplitude- and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) oscillations and jump components. Unlike existing methods that treat oscillatory modes and jump discontinuities separately and often require prior knowledge of the number of components (K) -- which is difficult to obtain in practice -- our approaches employ successive optimization-based schemes that jointly handle AM-FM oscillations and jump discontinuities without the need to predefine K. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms offer superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Artifact detection and localization in single-channel mobile EEG for sleep research using deep learning and attention mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artifacts in the electroencephalogram (EEG) degrade signal quality and impact the analysis of brain activity. Current methods for detecting artifacts in sleep EEG rely on simple threshold-based algorithms that require manual intervention, which is time-consuming and impractical due to the vast volume of data that novel mobile recording systems generate. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model incorporating a convolutional block attention module (CNN-CBAM) to detect and identify the location of artifacts in the sleep EEG with attention maps. We benchmarked this model against six other machine learning and signal processing approaches. We trained/tuned all models on 72 manually annotated EEG recordings obtained during home-based monitoring from 18 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.05 y ($\pm$5.02). We tested them on 26 separate recordings from 6 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.33 y ($\pm$4.08), with contained artifacts in 4\% of epochs. CNN-CBAM achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.88), sensitivity (0.81), and specificity (0.86) when compared to the other approaches. The attention maps from CNN-CBAM localized artifacts within the epoch with a sensitivity of 0.71 and specificity of 0.67. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automating the detection and localization of artifacts in wearable sleep EEG.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Smart Sportswear for Real-Time Fitness Monitoring Using Textile Strain Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable biosensors have revolutionized human performance monitoring by enabling real-time assessment of physiological and biomechanical parameters. However, existing solutions lack the ability to simultaneously capture breath-force coordination and muscle activation symmetry in a seamless and non-invasive manner, limiting their applicability in strength training and rehabilitation. This work presents a wearable smart sportswear system that integrates screen-printed graphene-based strain sensors with a wireless deep learning framework for real-time classification of exercise execution quality. By leveraging 1D ResNet-18 for feature extraction, the system achieves 92.3% classification accuracy across six exercise conditions, distinguishing between breathing irregularities and asymmetric muscle exertion. Additionally, t-SNE analysis and Grad-CAM-based explainability visualization confirm that the network accurately captures biomechanically relevant features, ensuring robust interpretability. The proposed system establishes a foundation for next-generation AI-powered sportswear, with applications in fitness optimization, injury prevention, and adaptive rehabilitation training.</description>

      <title>STF-GCN: A Multi-Domain Graph Convolution Network Method for Automatic Modulation Recognition via Adaptive Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is an essential part of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) dynamic spectrum allocation. However, current deep learning-based AMR (DL-AMR) methods are challenged to extract discriminative and robust features at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), where the representation of modulation symbols is highly interfered by noise. Furthermore, current research on GNN methods for AMR tasks generally suffers from issues related to graph structure construction and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal-Frequency Graph Convolution Network (STF-GCN) framework, with the temporal domain as the anchor point, to fuse spatial and frequency domain features embedded in the graph structure nodes. On this basis, an adaptive correlation-based adjacency matrix construction method is proposed, which significantly enhances the graph structure's capacity to aggregate local information into individual nodes. In addition, a PoolGAT layer is proposed to coarsen and compress the global key features of the graph, significantly reducing the computational complexity. The results of the experiments confirm that STF-GCN is able to achieve recognition performance far beyond the state-of-the-art DL-AMR algorithms, with overall accuracies of 64.35%, 66.04% and 70.95% on the RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b and RML22 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracies under low SNR conditions from -14dB to 0dB outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by 1.20%, 1.95% and 1.83%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit Waveform and Receive Filter Design for ISAC System with Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, to suppress jamming in the complex electromagnetic environment, we propose a joint transmit waveform and receive filter design framework for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). By jointly optimizing the transmit waveform and receive filters, we aim at minimizing the multiuser interference (MUI), subject to the constraints of the target mainlobe, jamming mainlobe and peak sidelobe level of the receive filter output as well as the transmit power of the ISAC base station. We propose two schemes to solve the problem, including joint transmit waveform and matched filter design (JTMD) and joint transmit waveform and mismatched filter design (JTMMD) schemes. For both schemes, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers to iteratively optimize the transmit waveform and receive filters, where the number of targets as well as the range and angles of each target can also be estimated. Simulation results show that both the JTMD and JTMMD schemes achieve superior performance in terms of communication MUI and radar detection performance.</description>

      <title>Distributed Uplink Joint Transmission for 6G Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral efficiency achieved through uplink joint transmission, where a serving user and the network users (UEs) collaborate by jointly transmitting to the base station (BS). The analysis incorporates the resource requirements for information sharing among UEs as a critical factor in the capacity evaluation. Furthermore, coherent and non-coherent joint transmission schemes are compared under various transmission power scenarios, providing insights into spectral and energy efficiency. A selection algorithm identifying the optimal UEs for joint transmission, achieving maximum capacity, is discussed. The results indicate that uplink joint transmission is one of the promising techniques for enabling 6G, achieving greater spectral efficiency even when accounting for the resource requirements for information sharing.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation and Hybrid Precoding for Massive MIMO-OTFS System With Doubly Squint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) are promising technologies for next generation wireless communication systems for their abilities to counteract the issue of high mobility with large Doppler spread and mitigate the channel path attenuation, respectively. The natural integration of massive MIMO with OTFS in millimeter-wave systems can improve communication data rate and enhance the spectral efficiency. However, when transmitting wideband signals with large-scale arrays, the beam squint effect may occur, causing discrepancies in beam directions across subcarriers in multi-carrier systems. Moreover, the high-mobility wideband millimeter wave communications
  can induce the Doppler squint effect, leading to different Doppler shifts among the subcarriers. Both beam squint effect and Doppler squint effect (denoted as doubly squint effect) can degrade communication performance significantly. In this paper, we present an efficient channel estimation and hybrid precoding scheme to address the doubly squint effect in massive MIMO-OTFS systems. We first characterize the wideband channel model and the input-output relationship for massive MIMO-OTFS transmission considering doubly squint effect. We then mathematically derive the impact of channel parameters on chirp pilots under the doubly squint effect. Additionally, we develop a peak-index-based channel estimation scheme. By leveraging the results from channel estimation, we propose a hybrid precoding method to mitigate the doubly squint effect in downlink transmission scenarios. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and show its superiority over the existing schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a typical uplink transmission scenario over multiple-input multiple-output multiple access channel (MIMO-MAC) and thus propose a multi-user learnable CSI fusion semantic communication (MU-LCFSC) framework. It incorporates CSI as the side information into both the semantic encoders and decoders to generate a proper feature mask map in order to produce a more robust attention weight distribution. Especially for the decoding end, a cooperative successive interference cancellation procedure is conducted along with a cooperative mask ratio generator, which flexibly controls the mask elements of feature mask maps. Numerical results verify the superiority of proposed MU-LCFSC compared to DeepJSCC-NOMA over 3 dB in terms of PSNR.</description>

      <title>InSPE: Rapid Evaluation of Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Infrastructure Sensor Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrastructure sensing is vital for traffic monitoring at safety hotspots (e.g., intersections) and serves as the backbone of cooperative perception in autonomous driving. While vehicle sensing has been extensively studied, infrastructure sensing has received little attention, especially given the unique challenges of diverse intersection geometries, complex occlusions, varying traffic conditions, and ambient environments like lighting and weather. To address these issues and ensure cost-effective sensor placement, we propose Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Infrastructure Sensor Placement Evaluation (InSPE), a perception surrogate metric set that rapidly assesses perception effectiveness across diverse infrastructure and environmental scenarios with combinations of multi-modal sensors. InSPE systematically evaluates perception capabilities by integrating three carefully designed metrics, i.e., sensor coverage, perception occlusion, and information gain. To support large-scale evaluation, we develop a data generation tool within the CARLA simulator and also introduce Infra-Set, a dataset covering diverse intersection types and environmental conditions. Benchmarking experiments with state-of-the-art perception algorithms demonstrate that InSPE enables efficient and scalable sensor placement analysis, providing a robust solution for optimizing intelligent intersection infrastructure.</description>

      <title>TorchFX: A modern approach to Audio DSP with PyTorch and GPU acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning complexity and real-time processing demands of audio signals necessitate optimized algorithms that harness the computational prowess of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Existing Digital Signal Processing (DSP) libraries often fall short in delivering the requisite efficiency and flexibility, particularly in integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. In response, we introduce TorchFX: a GPU-accelerated Python library for DSP, specifically engineered to facilitate sophisticated audio signal processing. Built atop the PyTorch framework, TorchFX offers an Object-Oriented interface that emulates the usability of torchaudio, enhancing functionality with a novel pipe operator for intuitive filter chaining. This library provides a comprehensive suite of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, with a focus on multichannel audio files, thus facilitating the integration of DSP and AI-based approaches. Our benchmarking results demonstrate significant efficiency gains over traditional libraries like SciPy, particularly in multichannel contexts. Despite current limitations in GPU compatibility, ongoing developments promise broader support and real-time processing capabilities. TorchFX aims to become a useful tool for the community, contributing to innovation and progress in DSP with GPU acceleration. TorchFX is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/matteospanio/torchfx.</description>

      <title>Reverberation-based Features for Sound Event Localization and Detection with Distance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound event localization and detection (SELD) involves predicting active sound event classes over time while estimating their positions. The localization subtask in SELD is usually treated as a direction of arrival estimation problem, ignoring source distance. Only recently, SELD was extended to 3D by incorporating distance estimation, enabling the prediction of sound event positions in 3D space (3D SELD). However, existing methods lack input features designed for distance estimation. We argue that reverberation encodes valuable information for this task. This paper introduces two novel feature formats for 3D SELD based on reverberation: one using direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR) and another leveraging signal autocorrelation to provide the model with insights into early reflections. Pre-training on synthetic data improves relative distance error (RDE) and overall SELD score, with autocorrelation-based features reducing RDE by over 3 percentage points on the STARSS23 dataset. The code to extract the features is available at github.com/dberghi/SELD-distance-features.</description>

      <title>RelCon: Relative Contrastive Learning for a Motion Foundation Model for Wearable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18822v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised Relative Contrastive learning approach for training a motion foundation model from wearable accelerometry sensors. First, a learnable distance measure is trained to capture motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. Then, the learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometry time-series, which we use to train our foundation model to model relative relationships across time and across subjects. The foundation model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks, including human activity recognition and gait metric regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a foundation model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</description>

      <title>Secure Communications for All Users in Low-Resolution IRS-aided Systems Under Imperfect and Unknown CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Provisioning secrecy for all users, given the heterogeneity and uncertainty of their channel conditions, locations, and the unknown location of the attacker/eavesdropper, is challenging and not always feasible. This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all users where a low resolution intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) is used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. In real-life scenarios, due to hardware limitations of the IRS' passive reflective elements (PREs), the use of a full-resolution (continuous) phase shift (CPS) is impractical. In this paper, we thus consider a more practical case where the phase shift (PS) is modeled by a low-resolution (quantized) phase shift (QPS) while addressing the phase shift error (PSE) induced by the imperfect channel state information (CSI). To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming vector and the IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under perfect/imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect/unknown CSI. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect/unknown CSI. To tackle it, we linearize the objective function and decompose the problem into sequential subproblems. When the perfect CSI is not available, we use the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to transform imperfect CSI related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear matrix inequalities (LMI). We prove that our proposed algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution with low computational complexity. Extensive simulations with practical settings show that our approach can ensure secure communication for all users while the IRS's PREs are quantized and are affected by the PSE.</description>

      <title>"Security for Everyone" in Finite Blocklength IRS-aided Systems With Perfect and Imperfect CSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Provisioning secrecy for all users, given the heterogeneity in their channel conditions, locations, and the unknown location of the attacker/eavesdropper, is challenging and not always feasible. The problem is even more difficult under finite blocklength constraints that are popular in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). This work takes the first step to guarantee secrecy for all URLLC/mMTC users in the finite blocklength regime (FBR) where intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are used to enhance legitimate users' reception and thwart the potential eavesdropper (Eve) from intercepting. To that end, we aim to maximize the minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all users by jointly optimizing the transmitter's beamforming and IRS's passive reflective elements (PREs) under the FBR latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and even more complicated under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To tackle it, we linearize the objective function, and decompose the problem into sequential subproblems. When perfect CSI is not available, we use the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to transform imperfect CSI-related semi-infinite constraints into finite linear matrix inequalities (LMI). We prove that our proposed algorithm converges to a locally optimal solution with low computational complexity thanks to our closed-form linearization approach. This makes the solution scalable for large IRS deployments. Extensive simulations with practical settings show that our approach can ensure secure communication for all users while satisfying FBR constraints even with only imperfect CSI.</description>
