      <title>Non-local high-$p_t$ transport in anisotropic QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a numerical study of non-local partonic transport in anisotropic QCD matter, relevant to the evolution of hard probes in the aftermath of high-energy nuclear scattering events. The recently derived master equation, obtained from QFT considerations, differs from Boltzmann transport by incorporating a non-local elastic scattering kernel arising from density gradients. After rewriting the master equation in a form suitable for numerical implementation and assuming a static density profile, we compare the non-local evolution to Boltzmann transport, demonstrating that the new interaction kernel is essential for accurately describing the azimuthal structure of the final-state momentum distribution. We further study the non-local partonic transport in the case of a matter profile governed by two-dimensional hydrodynamics, accounting for its flow and generalizing the evolution equation. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond classical transport at high-$p_t$ to accurately capture the structure of jets propagating through structured QCD matter. The master equation used in the numerical simulations can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art transport codes.</description>

      <title>Perturbative quantum Monte Carlo calculation with high-fidelity nuclear forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a family of powerful tools for addressing quantum many-body problems. However, its applications are often plagued by the fermionic sign problem. A promising strategy is to simulate an interaction without sign problem as the zeroth order and treat the other pieces as perturbations. According to this scheme, we construct precision nuclear chiral forces on the lattice and make perturbative calculations around a sign-problem-free interaction respecting the Wigner-SU(4) symmetry. We employ the recently developed perturbative QMC (ptQMC) method to calculate the perturbative energies up to the second order. This work presents the first ptQMC calculations for next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^3$LO) chiral forces and elucidates how the hierarchical nature of the chiral interactions helps organize and simplify the ptQMC calculations. We benchmark the algorithm for the deuteron, where exact solutions serve as rigorous reference points. We also reproduce the famous Tjon line by correlating the perturbative $^{4}$He binding energies with the non-perturbative $^{3}$H binding energies. These comprehensive demonstrations underscore the efficacy of ptQMC in resolving high-fidelity nuclear interactions, establishing its potential as a robust tool for \textit{ab initio} nuclear structure studies.</description>

      <title>Nuclear $\alpha$-cluster structures from valence-space microscopic cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alpha clustering is an important dynamic in nuclear physics, with growing interest to its study in heavy nuclei in recent years. Theoretically, the microscopic cluster models taking nucleons as relevant degrees of freedom have been widely used to study $\alpha$-cluster structures in light nuclei. However, a straightforward application on same footing in heavy nuclei is obstructed by the complexity of handling numerous nucleons. As a simplified alternative, the macroscopic cluster models built upon cluster degrees of freedom are usually employed in heavy nuclei, though these approaches typically lose several critical structural details. In this work, we propose to study the $\alpha$-cluster structures within the framework of valence-space microscopic cluster model (VS-MCM), which is a hybrid between microscopic and macroscopic cluster models and inherits features from both models, making it capable to investigate the $\alpha$-cluster structures in heavy nuclei from a relatively microscopic viewpoint. In VS-MCM, the valence $\alpha$ clusters are described by antisymmetrized microscopic wave functions, with single-particle orbits in core nuclei removed systematically from the model space via the Pauli projection to simulate the antisymmetrization between $\alpha$ clusters and doubly magic cores. As a proof of principle, we apply the VS-MCM to study the $\alpha$-cluster structures in ${}^{20}$Ne and ${}^{44}$Ti at first, with the theoretical energy levels of the $K^{\pi}=0_1^{\pm}$ bands for ${}^{20}$Ne and ${}^{44}$Ti showing reasonable agreement with experimental data. These calculations lay the foundation for future applications of VS-MCM in general cluster structures across the nuclide chart, where more $\alpha$ clusters and valence nucleons can exist outside the heavy doubly magic core, opening new avenues to study the $\alpha$ and cluster decays in heavy nuclei microscopically.</description>

      <title>Cross-Comparison of Sampling Algorithms for Pulse Profile Modeling of PSR J0740+6620</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few years, NICER data has enabled mass and radius inferences for various pulsars, and thus shed light on the equation of state for dense nuclear matter. This is achieved through a technique called pulse profile modeling. The importance of the results necessitates careful validation and testing of the robustness of the inference procedure. In this paper, we investigate the effect of sampler choice for X-PSI (X-ray Pulse Simulation and Inference), an open-source package for pulse profile modeling and Bayesian statistical inference that has been used extensively for analysis of NICER data. We focus on the specific case of the high-mass pulsar PSR J0740+6620. Using synthetic data that mimics the most recently analyzed NICER and XMM-Newton data sets of PSR J0740+6620, we evaluate the parameter recovery performance, convergence, and computational cost for MultiNest's multimodal nested sampling algorithm and UltraNest's slice nested sampling algorithm. We find that both samplers perform reliably, producing accurate and unbiased parameter estimation results when analyzing simulated data. We also investigate the consequences for inference using the real data for PSR J0740+6620, finding that both samplers produce consistent credible intervals.</description>

      <title>Effect of Light Nuclei on Chemical Freeze-out Parameters at RHIC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, including light-and strange-flavor particles and light nuclei, produced in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), was investigated. Using the thermal-FIST thermodynamic statistical model, we analyzed various particle sets: those inclusive of light nuclei, those exclusive to light nuclei, and those solely comprising light nuclei. We determined the chemical freeze-out parameters at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=$ 7.7--200 GeV and four different centralities. A significant finding was the decrease in the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ with light nuclei inclusion, with an even more pronounced reduction when considering light nuclei yields exclusively. This suggests that light nuclei formation occurs at a later stage in the system's evolution at RHIC energies. We present parameterized formulas that describe the energy dependence of $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ and the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ for three distinct particle sets in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. Our results reveal at least three distinct $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ at RHIC energies correspond to different freeze-out hypersurfaces: a light-flavor freeze-out temperature of $T_L$ = 150.2$\pm$6 MeV, a strange-flavor freeze-out temperature $T_s$ = 165.1$\pm$2.7 MeV, and a light-nuclei freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ln}}$ = 141.7$\pm$1.4 MeV. Notably, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Pb+Pb 2.76 TeV, the expected lower freeze-out temperature for light nuclei was not observed; instead, the $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ for light nuclei was found to be approximately 10 MeV higher than that for light-flavor hadrons.</description>

      <title>On elliptic flow and the blast-wave model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensions of the blast-wave model for the description of non-central collisions are reviewed and the physics behind them is explained and illustrated. It is shown how the second-order anisotropy in expansion velocity together with the anisotropy in the shape or the density profile of the fireball determine the elliptic flow of the produced hadrons. Ambiguities and limitations of the models are discussed and different models are compared among themselves and with example data. It is concluded that model results should always be compared to $v_2(p_t)$ from several identified species in order to receive meaningful results about the freeze-out stage of the fireball and that even such a comparison may not be conclusive as the models may not be able to reproduce all relevant data.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Jet Drift in QGP Hard Probe Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hard probe tomography of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy ion collisions has long been a preeminent goal of the high-energy nuclear physics program. In service of this goal, the isotropic modification of jets and high-energy hadrons has been studied in great detail at the leading-power (eikonal) level, with effects originating from sub-eikonal $\mathcal{O}(\mu/E)$ anisotropic interactions presumed to be small. We present the first investigation of sub-eikonal, collective-flow-induced asymmetric jet broadening (jet drift) in event-by-event $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV PbPb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider using the new Anisotropic Parton Evolution (APE) computational framework. We show that jet drift imparts a sizeable enhancement of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and increases the mean acoplanarity for low and intermediate energy particles ($p_T &lt; 10$ GeV). Importantly, these novel modifications to hard probe observables are shown to survive averaging over events and collision geometry. They couple to the collective flow of the medium seen by the jet and encode information about the QGP dynamics inaccessible to studies considering only isotropic, eikonal level effects.</description>

      <title>Emission processes in a self-consistent field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a microscopic description of cluster emission processes within the Cluster--Hartree--Fock (CHF) self--consistent field (SCF) theory. The starting point is a Woods--Saxon (WS) mean field (MF) with spin--orbit and Coulomb terms. Pairing is treated through standard Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) quasiparticles. The residual two--body interaction is given by a density--dependent Wigner force having a Gaussian shape with a center of mass (com) correction located in a region of low nuclear density slightly beyond the geometrical contact radius of a system comprised from a nucleus and a surface cluster. We show that such a description adequately reproduces the ground state (gs) shape of a spherical nucleus while the surface correction enhances the radial tail of single particle orbitals, thus allowing for an adequate description of the $\alpha$-decay width for unstable systems.</description>

Abstract: Kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter [($Y$+$K$) phase], which may be realized in neutron stars, is discussed on the basis of chiral symmetry. With the use of the effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon--baryon and kaon--kaon interactions; coupled with the relativistic mean field theory and universal three-baryon repulsive interaction, we clarify the effects of the $s$-wave kaon--baryon scalar interaction simulated by the kaon--baryon sigma terms and vector interaction (Tomozawa--Weinberg term) on kaon properties in hyperon-mixed matter, the onset density of kaon condensation, and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase. In particular, the quark condensates in the ($Y$+$K$) phase are obtained, and their relevance to chiral symmetry restoration is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description of quantum many-body dynamics is extremely challenging on classical computers, as it can involve many degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the time evolution of quantum states is a natural application for quantum computers that are designed to efficiently perform unitary transformations. In this paper, we study quantum algorithms for response functions, relevant for describing different reactions governed by linear response. We focus on nuclear-physics applications and consider a qubit-efficient mapping on the lattice, which can efficiently represent the large volumes required for realistic scattering simulations. For the case of a contact interaction, we develop an algorithm for time evolution based on the Trotter approximation that scales logarithmically with the lattice size, and is combined with quantum phase estimation. We eventually focus on the nuclear two-body system and a typical response function relevant for electron scattering as an example. We also investigate ground-state preparation and examine the total circuit depth required for a realistic calculation and the hardware noise level required to interpret the signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigation of decay and scattering processes of particles in a vortex state offers a novel and promising approach for probing particle structure. Our study reveals distinct properties of vortex neutron decay, which deviate from those of classical plane-wave neutron decay. We present the energy-angle distributions of the final-state electron and antineutrino in unpolarized vortex neutrons, as well as angle distributions integrated over their energies. Notably, we provide theoretical calculations of the decay behavior of neutrons with varying vortex cone angles and initial energies. We propose that identifying the vortex state of the initial neutron can be achieved by analyzing the angular and energy distributions of the final-state particles, introducing new degrees of freedom for studying weak interactions and neutron decay kinematics that have been previously overlooked in particle physics. This timely investigation takes advantage of recent advancements in vortex neutron preparation and analysis, opening up new avenues for exploring the fundamental properties of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment(ICNSE) has been proposed at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process using electron antineutrinos produced from reactors. Phenomenological studies are performed to find out the sensitivity of sapphire detector for various fundamental physics parameters at an exposure of one year. Reactors of different core compositions, sizes, and thermal powers have been considered as sources of electron antineutrinos. The potential of the ICNSE to measure the weak mixing angle at a low energy regime has been extracted. Furthermore, the detector's capability has been investigated for examining the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their magnetic moment. Additionally, an exploration has been conducted on the detector's sensitivity in restricting new interactions between neutrinos and electrons or nuclei, thereby constraining the parameter space related to light mediators. It is found that the ICNSE detector can put a stronger constraints on the scalar and vector mediators masses.</description>
