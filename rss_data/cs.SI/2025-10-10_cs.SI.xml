      <title>From Keywords to Clusters: AI-Driven Analysis of YouTube Comments to Reveal Election Issue Salience in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters' choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November 5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.</description>

      <title>Do We Really Need SFT? Prompt-as-Policy over Knowledge Graphs for Cold-start Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is crucial for smart urban services such as tourism, dining, and transportation, yet most approaches struggle under cold-start conditions where user-POI interactions are sparse. Recent efforts leveraging large language models (LLMs) address this challenge through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL). However, SFT demands costly annotations and fails to generalize to inactive users, while static prompts in ICL cannot adapt to diverse user contexts. To overcome these limitations, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs, a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that learns to construct prompts dynamically through contextual bandit optimization. Our method treats prompt construction as a learnable policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) the number of evidence per candidate, and (iii) their organization and ordering within prompts. More specifically, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) to discover candidates and mine relational paths, which are transformed into evidence cards that summarize rationales for each candidate POI. The frozen LLM then acts as a reasoning engine, generating recommendations from the KG-discovered candidate set based on the policy-optimized prompts. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average 7.7\% relative improvements in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance on active users, without requiring model fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Geometric opinion exchange polarizes in every dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent line of work studies models of opinion exchange where agent opinions about $d$ topics are tracked simultaneously. The opinions are represented as vectors on the unit $(d-1)$-sphere, and the update rule is based on the overall correlation between the relevant vectors. The update rule reflects the assumption of biased assimilation, i.e., a pair of opinions is brought closer together if their correlation is positive and further apart if the correlation is negative.
  This model seems to induce the polarization of opinions into two antipodal groups. This is in contrast to many other known models which tend to achieve consensus. The polarization property has been recently proved for $d=2$, but the general case of $d \ge 3$ remained open. In this work, we settle the general case, using a more detailed understanding of the model dynamics and tools from the theory of random processes.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Buzz: Enriching Hashtag Popularity Prediction with LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hashtag trends ignite campaigns, shift public opinion, and steer millions of dollars in advertising spend, yet forecasting which tag goes viral is elusive. Classical regressors digest surface features but ignore context, while large language models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning but misestimate numbers. We present BuzzProphet, a reasoning-augmented hashtag popularity prediction framework that (1) instructs an LLM to articulate a hashtag's topical virality, audience reach, and timing advantage; (2) utilizes these popularity-oriented rationales to enrich the input features; and (3) regresses on these inputs. To facilitate evaluation, we release HashView, a 7,532-hashtag benchmark curated from social media. Across diverse regressor-LLM combinations, BuzzProphet reduces RMSE by up to 2.8% and boosts correlation by 30% over baselines, while producing human-readable rationales. Results demonstrate that using LLMs as context reasoners rather than numeric predictors injects domain insight into tabular models, yielding an interpretable and deployable solution for social media trend forecasting.</description>

      <title>Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in formulating strategies for urban renewal.</description>

      <title>Chisme: Fully Decentralized Differentiated Deep Learning for IoT Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As end-user device capability increases and demand for intelligent services at the Internet's edge rise, distributed learning has emerged as a key enabling technology. Existing approaches like federated learning (FL) and decentralized FL (DFL) enable distributed learning among clients, while gossip learning (GL) approaches have emerged to address the potential challenges in resource-constrained, connectivity-challenged infrastructure-less environments. However, most distributed learning approaches assume largely homogeneous data distributions and may not consider or exploit the heterogeneity of clients and their underlying data distributions. This paper introduces Chisme, a novel fully decentralized distributed learning algorithm designed to address the challenges of implementing robust intelligence in network edge contexts characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and sparse network infrastructure. Chisme leverages cosine similarity-based data affinity heuristics calculated from received model exchanges to inform how much influence received models have when merging into the local model. By doing so, it facilitates stronger merging influence between clients with more similar model learning progressions, enabling clients to strategically balance between broader collaboration to build more general knowledge and more selective collaboration to build specific knowledge. We evaluate Chisme against contemporary approaches using image recognition and time-series prediction scenarios while considering different network connectivity conditions, representative of real-world distributed intelligent systems. Our experiments demonstrate that Chisme outperforms state-of-the-art edge intelligence approaches in almost every case -- clients using Chisme exhibit faster training convergence, lower final loss after training, and lower performance disparity between clients.</description>

      <title>The Price of Uncertainty for Social Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How hard is it to achieve consensus in a social network under uncertainty? In this paper we model this problem as a social graph of agents where each vertex is initially colored red or blue. The goal of the agents is to achieve consensus, which is when the colors of all agents align. Agents attempt to do this locally through steps in which an agent changes their color to the color of the majority of their neighbors. In real life, agents may not know exactly how many of their neighbors are red or blue, which introduces uncertainty into this process. Modeling uncertainty as perturbations of relative magnitude $1+\varepsilon$ to these color neighbor counts, we show that even small values of $\varepsilon$ greatly hinder the ability to achieve consensus in a social network. We prove theoretically tight upper and lower bounds on the price of uncertainty, a metric defined by Balcan et al. to quantify the effect of uncertainty in network games.</description>
