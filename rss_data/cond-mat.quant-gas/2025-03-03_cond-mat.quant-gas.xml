      <title>Efimov Effect in Long-range Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two non-relativistic particles interact resonantly in three dimensions, an infinite tower of three-body bound states emerges, exhibiting a discrete scale invariance. This universal phenomenon, known as the Efimov effect, has garnered extensive attention across various fields, including atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and particle physics. In this letter, we demonstrate that the Efimov effect also manifests in long-range quantum spin chains. The long-range coupling modifies the low-energy dispersion of magnons, enabling the emergence of continuous scale invariance for two-magnon states at resonance. This invariance is subsequently broken to discrete scale invariance upon imposing short-range boundary conditions for the three-magnon problem, leading to the celebrated Efimov bound states. Using effective field theory, we theoretically determine how the ratio of two successive binding energies depends on the interaction range, which agrees with the numerical solution of the bound-state problem. We further discuss generalizations to arbitrary spatial dimensions, where the traditional Efimov effect serves as a special case. Our results reveal universal physics in dilute quantum gases of magnons that can be experimentally tested in trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Optical response of the supersolid polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground-state properties of the supersolid polaron consisting of a neutral impurity immersed in a dipolar supersolid have recently been studied. Here, the optical response of an impurity in a dipolar supersolid is calculated and interpreted in terms of the contributions of the different excitation modes of the supersolid. The optical absorption spectrum reveals the two Van Hove singularities that correspond to the flattening of the two Goldstone modes of the supersolid at the Brillouin zone edge. A single peak is found in the superfluid regime corresponding to the roton minimum which diverges at the transition. We propose the response of an ionic impurity as an experimental probe for the supersolid excitations and show how this technique can be extended to neutral impurities with an electric or magnetic dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Polarons in supersolids: path-integral treatment of an impurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supersolid phase of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate has an intriguing excitation spectrum displaying a band structure. Here, the dressing of an impurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid with the excitations of the supersolid is studied. The ground-state energy of the supersolid polaron is calculated using a variational path integral approach, which obtained accurate results for other polaron systems within the Bogoliubov and Fr\"ohlich approximations. A divergence is observed at the superfluid-supersolid phase transition. The polaron radius is also computed, showing that as a function of impurity-atom interactions, the polaron can become localized to a single droplet, behaving like a small solid-state polaron.</description>

      <title>Spin self-organization in an optical cavity facilitated by inhomogeneous broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the onset of collective spin-self-organization in a thermal ensemble of driven two-level atoms confined in an optical cavity. The atoms spontaneously form a spin-pattern above a critical driving strength that sets a threshold and is determined by the cavity parameters, the initial temperature, and the transition frequency of the atomic spin. Remarkably, we find that inhomogeneous Doppler broadening facilitates the onset of spin-self-organization. In particular, the threshold is non-monotonic when increasing the spin transition frequency and reaches a minimum when the Doppler broadening is of similar magnitude. This feature emerges due to Doppler-induced resonances. Above the threshold, we find cooperative dynamics of spin, spatial, and momentum degrees of freedom leading to density modulations, fast reduction of kinetic energy, and the emergence of non-thermal states. More broadly, our work demonstrates how broadening can facilitate strong light-matter interactions in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but "dressed" by the condensate profile) and the second to the "skewness" of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations when such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.</description>
