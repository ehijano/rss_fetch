      <title>Enabling Continuous THz Band Coverage via Precise Electron Beam Tailoring in Free-electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power, continuously tunable narrowband terahertz (THz) sources are essential for advancing nonlinear optics, THz-driven material dynamics, and ultrafast spectroscopy. Conventional techniques typically impose a trade-off between pulse energy and frequency tunability. Here, we introduce a novel free-electron laser approach that overcomes these limitations by pre-modulating a relativistic electron beam with a frequency-beating laser pulse and leveraging bunch compression along with collective effects to enhance microbunching. Experimental results demonstrate that this technique generates narrowband THz emission with continuous frequency tunability from 7.8 to 30.8THz, achieving pulse energies up to 385{\mu}J while maintaining spectral bandwidths between 7.7% and 14.7%. Moreover, the method exhibits exceptional robustness and scalability, highlighting its unique ability to bridge the long-standing THz gap and offering a promising solution for diverse cutting-edge scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Contribution of ALEGRO to the Update of the European Strategy on Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced and novel accelerators (ANAs), driven a by laser pulse or a relativistic particle bunch, have made remarkable progress over the last decades. They accelerated electrons by 10GeV in 30cm (laser driven) and by 42GeV in 85cm (particle bunch driven). Rapid progress continues with lasers, plasma sources, computational methods, and more. In this document we highlight the main contributions made by the various major collaborations, facilities, and experiments that develop ANAs for applications to particle and high-energy physics. These include: ALiVE, ANL-AWA, AWAKE, BNL-ATF, CEPC Injector, DESY-KALDERA, ELI ERIC, EuPRAXIA, HALHF, LBNL-BELLA, LBNL-kBELLA, LCvison, PETRA IV Injector, 10TeV Collider design, SLAC-FACET II, as well as the development of structures, lasers and plasma sources, and sustainability, and demonstrate the intense activities in the field. ANAs can have, and already have, applications to particle and high-energy physics as subsystems, the so-called intermediate applications: injectors, lower energy experiments, beam dump experiments, test beds for detectors, etc. Additionally, an ANA could be an upgrade for any Higgs factory based on a linear accelerator, as proposed in the LCvison project. ANAs have advantages over other concepts for reaching multi-TeV energies: lower geographical and environmental footprints, higher luminosity to power ratio, and are thus more sustainable than other accelerators. However, ANAs must still meet a number of challenges before they can produce bunches with parameters and the luminosity required for a linear collider at the energy frontier. It is therefore extremely important to strongly support vigorous R&amp;D of ANAs, because they are, at this time, the most sustainable acceleration scheme to reach very high energies with a linear accelerator.</description>

      <title>Long-range correlations in the intrabeam scattering in relativistic beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard approach in the conventional theory of intrabeam scattering (IBS) is based on the analysis of binary Coulomb collisions of charged particles in the beam. This picture is only partially true: in reality, a given particle collides simultaneously with many partners and a more rigorous treatment should take this collective aspect of the collisions into account. A framework for such treatment has been known in plasma physics since beginning of the 1960s. In this work, we will show how it can be applied to IBS in relativistic beams for a particular problem of the growth of the beam energy spread. A preliminary conclusion of this work is that the conventional IBS theory might underestimate the effects of long-range correlations in Coulomb collisions in the beam.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Enhanced Superconducting Properties in Niobium Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. Additionally, we report measurements of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of two Nb SRF cavities processed using distinct methods. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</description>

      <title>Monochromatization interaction region optics design for direct s-channel Higgs production at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FCC-ee offers the potential to measure the electron Yukawa coupling via direct s-channel Higgs production, $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \text{H}$, at a centre-of-mass (CM) energy of ~125 GeV. This measurement is significantly facilitated if the CM energy spread of $e^+ e^-$ collisions can be reduced to a level comparable to the natural width of the Higgs boson, $\Gamma_{\text{H}}$ = 4.1 MeV, without substantial loss in luminosity. Achieving this reduction in collision-energy spread is possible through the "monochromatization" concept. The basic idea is to create opposite correlations between spatial position and energy deviation within the colliding beams, which can be accomplished in beam optics by introducing a nonzero dispersion function with opposite signs for the two beams at the interaction point. Since the first proposal in 2016, the implementation of monochromatization at the FCC-ee has been continuously improved, starting from preliminary parametric studies. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the interaction region optics design for this newly proposed collision mode, exploring different potential configurations and their implementation in the FCC-ee global lattice, along with beam dynamics simulations and performance evaluations including the impact of "beamstrahlung."</description>

      <title>High-energy polarized electron beams from the ionization of isolated spin polarized hydrogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a laser-based method for the preparation of high-energy polarized electrons, from the ionization of isolated spin-polarized hydrogen (SPH) atoms. The SPH atoms are prepared from the photodissociation of HCl, using two consecutive UV pulses of ps duration. By appropriately timing and focusing the pulses, we can spatially separate the highly polarized SPH from other unwanted photoproducts, which then act as the target for the acceleration lasers. We show how elastic collisions define number density $n$ and polarization P regimes ($10^{16}\leq$ $n$ $\leq 10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, 0.99 $\geq$ P $\geq$ 0.40) for the pre-polarized targets, and use particle-in-cell simulations to demonstrate the method's feasibility.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are a key focus of current research in nuclear physics. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo \b{eta}+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes or incorrect calibration of the planning CT. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
