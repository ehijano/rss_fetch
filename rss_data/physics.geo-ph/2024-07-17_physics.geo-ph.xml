      <title>Ground electrical and electromagnetic methods for deep mineral exploration -- results from the SEEMS DEEP project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition towards carbon neutral transportation and energy sources increases the global demand for mineral raw materials while easy-to-find near-surface (\&lt; 200 m) ore deposits are unlikely discovered in well-explored areas such as Europe. In order to increase the mineral exploration success rate, the project SEEMS DEEP (SEismic and ElectroMagnetic methodS for DEEP mineral exploration) develops geophysical deep exploration workflow capable of imaging the bedrock from the surface down to several kilometres depth. In this paper, we present first results from ground electrical and electromagnetic surveys conducted at the SEEM DEEP geological test site, namely the Koillismaa Layered Intrusion Complex in north-eastern Finland. Here, a 1.7 km long hole drilled by GTK intersected mafic-ultramafic rocks with anomalous electrical and chargeability properties at ~1400 m depth, making it an interesting case study to test the ability of such technologies for imaging resistivity and chargeability contrasts at several kilometre depth.</description>

      <title>Classification of Geological Borehole Descriptions Using a Domain Adapted Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geological borehole descriptions contain detailed textual information about the composition of the subsurface. However, their unstructured format presents significant challenges for extracting relevant features into a structured format. This paper introduces GEOBERTje: a domain adapted large language model trained on geological borehole descriptions from Flanders (Belgium) in the Dutch language. This model effectively extracts relevant information from the borehole descriptions and represents it into a numeric vector space. Showcasing just one potential application of GEOBERTje, we finetune a classifier model on a limited number of manually labeled observations. This classifier categorizes borehole descriptions into a main, second and third lithology class. We show that our classifier outperforms both a rule-based approach and GPT-4 of OpenAI. This study exemplifies how domain adapted large language models enhance the efficiency and accuracy of extracting information from complex, unstructured geological descriptions. This offers new opportunities for geological analysis and modeling using vast amounts of data.</description>

      <title>Multiple overspill flood channels from young craters require surface melting and hundreds of meters of mid-latitude ice late in Mars history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mars' tadpole craters are small, young craters whose crater rims are incised by one or more exit breaches but lack visible inlets. The tadpole forming climate records the poorly understood drying of Mars since the Early Hesperian. A third of tadpole craters have multiple breaches, therefore a process is needed that was able to generate crater rim incision in multiple locations. We use HiRISE data for four multiple breach tadpole craters to measure their crater fill, rims, and exit breaches. We compare these measurements and other data to our calculations of liquid water supply by rain, surface melting, groundwater discharge, and basal ice sheet melting to discriminate between four proposed formation hypotheses for tadpole breaches, favoring scenarios with ice-filled craters and supraglacial melting. We conclude that multiple breach tadpole craters record hundreds of meters of mid-latitude ice and climate conditions enabling intermittent melting in the Late Hesperian and Amazonian, suggesting that liquid water on Mars has been available in association with water ice for billions of years.</description>

      <title>Navigating Munk's Abyssal Recipes: Reconciling the Paradoxes and Suggesting an Upwelling Mechanism for Bottom Water in a Flat-Bottom Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walter Munk's classical work, known as the "abyssal recipes", introduced a foundational framework for comprehending the upwelling of abyssal waters. While it has spurred numerous investigations into the complexities of deep-ocean processes from theoretical, laboratory, and field perspectives, it has also faced challenges when compared to direct observations spanning decades. Two particularly intriguing paradoxes emerge: the dichotomy of diffusivities and the conundrum of interior downwelling. This study attempts to resolve these paradoxes by examining the isopycnal displacement velocity within the dynamic framework of Munk's abyssal recipes. A relieving inference is that it seems no longer an imperative to seek a globally averaged diapycnal diffusivity of O(1) cm2/s to close the mass budget associated with the bottom-water formation rate. Through box-model experiments, a novel erosion-intrusion model is proposed to elucidate the mechanism of abyssal upwelling in flat-bottom ocean, drawing an analogy to the growth of "tree rings". Based upon this model, the average rising velocity in the abyssal North Pacific is estimated using observational data of biogeochemical tracers. The proposed model does not seek to disprove existing theories but rather acts as a complement for situations that prevailing theories may not apply, such as cases with flat-bottom topography or non-bottom-intensified diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Semi-Analytical Modeling of Transient Stream Drawdown and Depletion in Response to Aquifer Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical and semi-analytical models for stream depletion with transient stream stage drawdown induced by groundwater pumping are developed to address a deficiency in existing models, namely, the use of a fixed stream stage condition at the stream-aquifer interface. Field data are presented to demonstrate that stream stage drawdown does indeed occur in response to groundwater pumping near aquifer connected streams. A model that predicts stream depletion with transient stream drawdown is developed, based on stream channel mass conservation and finite stream channel storage. The resulting models are shown to reduce to existing fixed-stage models in the limit as stream channel storage becomes infinitely large, and to the confined aquifer flow with a no-flow boundary at the streambed in the limit as stream storage becomes vanishingly small. The model is applied to field measurements of aquifer and stream drawdown, giving estimates of aquifer hydraulic parameters, streambed conductance and a measure of stream channel storage. The results of the modeling and data analysis presented herein have implications for sustainable groundwater management.</description>

      <title>Origins of complexity in the rheology of Soft Earth suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When wet soil becomes fully saturated by intense rainfall, or is shaken by an earthquake, it may fluidize catastrophically. Sand-rich slurries are treated as granular suspensions, where the failure is related to an unjamming transition. Mud flows are modeled as gels, where yielding and shear-thinning behaviors arise from inter-particle attraction and clustering. Here we show that the full range of complex flow behaviors previously reported for natural debris flows can be reproduced with three ingredients: water, silica sand, and kaolin clay. Going from sand-rich to clay-rich suspensions, we observe continuous transition from brittle to ductile yielding. We propose a general constitutive relation for soil suspensions, with a particle rearrangement time that is controlled by yield stress and jamming distance. Our experimental results are supported by models for amorphous solids, suggesting that the paradigm of non-equilibrium phase transitions can help us understand and predict the complex behaviors of Soft Earth suspensions.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids at extreme pressure-temperature conditions</title>

Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the building blocks of biomolecules may have originated in early Earth and other planets. Our findings contribute to an evolving understanding of the fundamental conditions necessary for life to arise.</description>
