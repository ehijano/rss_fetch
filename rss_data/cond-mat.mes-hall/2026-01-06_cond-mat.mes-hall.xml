      <title>Moir\'e-Driven Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbations in moir\'e materials, such as due to substrates or strain, are common in many experiments and can significantly modify the electronic properties of the system. Here, we show that perturbations in twisted bilayer graphene tend to be transferred between the coupled Dirac cones, eventually reaching an equilibrium near the magic angle. We connect our results to experiments and show that this equilibrium behavior remains robust even when the moir\'e potential itself is perturbed. Our findings extend the notion of the magic angle to a more general regime governed by moir\'e-driven equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Terahertz magneto-photocurrents in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ probe its topological surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ultrafast magneto-photocurrents in a three-dimensional topological insulator. For this purpose, we excite (In$_r$Bi$_{1-r}$)$_2$Se$_3$ thin films with a femtosecond laser pulse in the presence of an external magnetic field $B_{\text{ext}}$ up to 0.3 T parallel to the film plane. The resulting in-plane photocurrent is measured by detecting the emitted terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse. It scales linearly with $B_{\text{ext}}$ and is perpendicular to $B_{\text{ext}}$. Strikingly, for $r\ge$4%, we observe an abrupt photocurrent reduction, which is strongly correlated with the Indium-induced quenching of the topological surface states. The rise time, decay time and amplitude of the THz magneto-photocurrent can consistently be explained by a scenario in which optically excited spin-polarized electrons propagate toward the film surface where the accumulated spin is converted into an in-plane charge current due to spin-velocity locking. Our results are highly relevant for contact-free probing of spin-charge conversion in systems with paramagnetic rather than spontaneous magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Detection of MEMS Acoustics via Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have traditionally addressed vastly different length scales - one resolving atoms, the other engineering macroscopic motion. Here we unite these two fields to perform minimally invasive-measurements of high aspect-ratio MEMS resonators using the STM tip as both actuator and detector. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, we resolve acoustic modes of millimeter-scale, high-Q membranes with picometer spatial precision, without making use of lasers or capacitive coupling. The tunneling junction introduces negligible back-action or heating, enabling direct access to the intrinsic dynamics of microgram-mass oscillators. In this work we explore three different measurement modalities, each offering unique advantages. Combined, they provide a pathway to quantum-level readout and exquisite high-precision measurements of forces, displacements, and pressures at cryogenic conditions. This technique provides a general platform for minimally-perturbative detection across a wide range of nanomechanical and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Family of High-Chern-Number Orbital Magnets in Twisted Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing Chern insulators with Chern numbers greater than one remains a major goal in quantum materials research. Such platforms promise multichannel dissipationless chiral transport and access to correlated phases beyond the conventional C = 1 paradigm. Here, we discover a family of high-Chern-number orbital magnets in twisted monolayer-multilayer rhombohedral graphene, denoted (1+n) with n = 3, 4, and 5. Magnetotransport measurements show pronounced anomalous Hall effects at one and three electrons per moir\'e unit cell when they are polarized away from the moir\'e interface. Across the (1+n) systems, we observe a clear topological hierarchy C = n, revealed by the St\v{r}eda trajectories and the quantized Hall resistance. Our experimental observations are supported by self-consistent mean-field calculations. Moreover, we realize both electrical and magnetic switching of the high-Chern-number states by flipping the valley polarization. Together, these results establish a tunable hierarchy of orbital Chern magnets in twisted rhombohedral graphene, offering systematic control of Chern number and topology through layer engineering in pristine graphene moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Topological bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum, originally proposed within the framework of quantum mechanics, have since been observed in a variety of physical contexts, including electromagnetism, acoustics, and optics. Of particular interest are those bound states in the continuum that are protected by continuous symmetries, as their stability makes them resistant to structural imperfections and material disorder. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of topologically protected bound states in the continuum by coupling a finite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain to a metallic lead. These states are characterized by distinct features in the electrical response of the system, serving as a direct indication of their topological origin. The inherent robustness of such topologically protected states highlights their potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum information processing as well as in the design of advanced electronic and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Ohm's Law by Disorders in Low-Dimensional Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ohm's law provides a fundamental framework for understanding charge transport in conductors and underpins the concept of electrical scaling that has enabled the continuous advancement of modern CMOS technologies. As transistors are scaled to even smaller dimensions, device channels inevitably enter low-dimensional regimes to achieve higher performance. Low-dimensional materials such as atomically thin oxide semiconductors, 2D van der Waals semiconductors, and 1D carbon nanotubes, have thus emerged as key candidates for extending Moore's law. Here, we reveal the fundamental distinction between three-dimensional and low-dimensional conductors arising from disorder-induced electron localization, which leads to the breakdown of Ohm's law and lateral linear scaling. We develop a quantitative model that captures the role of the disordered region, a unique characteristic intrinsically to low-dimensional transistors. Furthermore, the disorder-induced localization framework consistently explains experimental observations in atomically thin In2O3 field-effect transistors across variations in channel length, temperature, thickness, and post-annealing conditions. This work establishes a unified physical picture for understanding and optimizing disorder-driven electronic transport in low-dimensional transistors.</description>

      <title>Alignment-Dependent Gapless Chiral Split Magnons in Altermagnetic Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, an emerging class of magnetic materials, exhibit exotic chiral split magnons that are of great interest for both fundamental physics and spintronic applications. However, detecting and manipulating these magnons is challenging due to their THz frequency response. Here, we report the discovery of gapless chiral split magnons confined within altermagnetic domain walls. Unlike in conventional ferromagnets or antiferromagnets, their spectrum is highly sensitive to the domain wall orientation relative to the crystal axis. These magnons inherit the chiral splitting of their bulk counterparts and are detectable in the microwave regime, offering a distinctive signature for identifying altermagnets. We further show that the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction drives hybridization of magnons with opposite chiralities, enabling unidirectional strong magnon-magnon coupling. Moreover, we demonstrate that spin-orbit torque can control the domain wall orientation, providing a practical means to manipulate these chiral magnons. Our findings open pathways for novel magnonic nanocircuitry based on altermagnetic domain walls.</description>

      <title>Generating unconventional spin-orbit torques with patterned phase gradients in tungsten thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key aim in spintronics is to achieve current-induced magnetization switching via spin-orbit torques without external magnetic fields. For this, the focus of recent work has been on introducing controlled lateral gradients across ferromagnet/heavy-metal devices, giving variations in thickness, composition, or interface quality. However, the small gradients achievable with common growth techniques limit both the impact of this approach and understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Here, spin-orbit torques are patterned on a mesoscopic length scale in tungsten thin films using direct-write laser annealing. Through transmission electron microscopy, resistivity, and second harmonic measurements, the continuous transformation of the crystalline phase of W films from the highly spin-orbit coupled, high resistivity $\beta$ phase to the minimally spin-orbit coupled, low resistivity $\alpha$ phase is tracked with increasing laser fluence. Gradients with different steepness are patterned in the tungsten phase to create spin-orbit torque channels and, when interfaced with CoFeB, tungsten wires with a sufficiently strong gradient can switch the magnetization without an applied magnetic field. Therefore, exploiting the unique microstructure of mixed-phase W allows precise control of the local electronic current density and direction, as well as local spin-orbit torque efficiency, providing a new avenue for the design of efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Band-Edge Carrier Trapping Limits Light Emission in WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit bright photoluminescence, a desirable property for light-emitting diodes and single-photon emitters. Because the emission intensity is heavily influenced by factors such as defect density and oxidation, it is critical to understand how they affect photoluminescence efficiency. However, due to the time-consuming process of identifying individual monolayers, studies of high-quality exfoliated TMDs have been limited to only a few samples. Here, we present an investigation of excited-state lifetimes and spectra for over 200 WSe$_2$ exfoliated monolayers at room temperature. We find a linear correlation between photoluminescence lifetime and intensity across hundreds of monolayers and within individual monolayers. Results from intentional photooxidation experiments indicate that this correlation is due to photoinduced band-edge carrier traps, which introduce a nonradiative decay pathway that competes with exciton emission. Our work highlights the importance of controlling such traps, as they are the primary limitation of bright photoluminescence.</description>

      <title>A Universal Model for the Resting Potential in Nanofluidic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Anomalous Transport via Crystal Symmetry in 2D Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous transports, including the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), are typical manifestations of time-reversal-symmetry-breaking responses in materials. In general, the two Hall states with opposite Hall conductivities can be regarded as time-reversal pairs coupled to magnetic order, and switching between them relies on reversing the magnetization via an external magnetic field or electric current. Here, we introduce a approach for manipulating anomalous transport through crystal symmetry engineering in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems. Based on symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that 2D altermagnets (AM) with out-of-plane N\'eel vectors will not host any anomalous Hall transport. Remarkably, breaking the symmetry connecting the two magnetic sublattices, an anomalous Hall response can emerge immediately, and the signs of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities can be flexibly controlled by the symmetry-breaking term, thereby realizing tunable sign-reversible anomalous transport. Furthermore, the feasibility of the theoretical scheme is further verified by explicit lattice-model construction. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the realization of crystal symmetry-controlled anomalous transport in a 2D AM material Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$. The results indicate that Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$ with out-of-plane N\'eel vectors can sequentially exhibit the AHE and quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) under continuous uniaxial strain. Interestingly, the sign reversal between these two effects can be achieved by simply rotating the strain direction by C$_{4z}$ symmetry. The corresponding ANE and its sign reversal are also revealed. Our findings provide a new strategy to manipulate anomalous transport, and should have significant potential applications.</description>

      <title>Probing the dynamics and configurations of single molecule junctions via Seebeck coefficient spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single molecule junctions exhibit dynamic structural configurations that strongly influence their electronic and thermoelectric properties. Here, we combine conductance (G) and Seebeck coefficient (S) measurements using the novel AC based scanning tunnelling microscope break junction technique to probe the real-time evolution of oligo(phenylene ethynylene) molecular junctions. We show that most junctions undergo configuration changes that lead to notable changes in S while G remains nearly constant. Density functional theory and quantum transport simulations link these observations to variations in contact geometry and charge transfer at the molecule electrode interface. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous G and S measurements enable direct access to the dynamic reconfiguration of single molecule junctions and offer design insights for thermoelectric molecular devices and new routes for increasing single molecule junction stability.</description>

      <title>Two-Qubit Module Based on Phonon-Coupled Ge Hole-Spin Qubits: Design, Fabrication, and Readout at 1-4 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a device-level design for a two-qubit module based on phonon-coupled germanium (Ge) hole-spin qubits operating at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Building on prior work on phonon-engineered Ge qubits and phononic-crystal (PnC) cavities, we specify a lithography-ready layout that integrates two gate-defined hole-spin qubits in a strained Ge quantum well with a GHz PnC defect mode that mediates a coherent phonon-based interaction. We detail the SiGe/Ge heterostructure, PnC cavity design, and a compatible nanofabrication process flow, including the gate stack, membrane patterning and release, and RF/DC wiring. We further develop a readout architecture combining spin-to-charge conversion with RF reflectometry on a proximal charge sensor, supported by a cryogenic RF chain optimized for operation at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Finally, we outline the cryogenic measurement environment, tuning procedures, and a stepwise benchmarking program targeting single-qubit control, phonon-bandgap suppression of relaxation channels, and resolvable phonon-mediated two-qubit coupling. The resulting module provides a scalable template for medium-range coupling of Ge hole-spin qubits and connects materials and phonon engineering with circuit-level readout, enabling future experimental demonstrations of entangling gates, Bell-state generation, and phonon-enabled quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>AI-enhanced tuning of quantum dot Hamiltonians toward Majorana modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a neural network-based model capable of learning the broad landscape of working regimes in quantum dot simulators, and using this knowledge to autotune these devices - based on transport measurements - toward obtaining Majorana modes in the structure. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on synthetic data in the form of conductance maps, using a physics-informed loss that incorporates key properties of Majorana zero modes. We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase. Starting from a broad range of initial detunings in parameter space, a single update step is sufficient to generate nontrivial zero modes. Moreover, by enabling an iterative tuning procedure - where the system acquires updated conductance maps at each step - we demonstrate that the method can address a much larger region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Topological Magnons and Giant Orbital Nernst Effect in a Zigzag Kitaev Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of topological and transport properties of collinear antiferromagnets and the role of Kitaev interactions in realising topological states therein have rarely been systematically addressed in literature. In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transport properties. The hybridization between the up- and down-spin sectors carries evidences of opening bulk gaps in the magnon band structure, giving rise to nontrivial topological phases characterized by finite Chern numbers, chiral edge modes, and a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity. Furthermore, generally speaking, a finite magnon orbital moment can exist and contribute to the Nernst response even when the net spin moment vanishes owing to the fundamental independence of the spin and orbital magnetizations. This motivates us to investigate the magnon orbital moment, orbital Berry curvature, and the resulting orbital Nernst conductivity associated with the magnon bands. We find that a giant orbital Nernst conductivity emerges even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the distinction between different topological phases is more lucidly manifested via the orbital Nernst conductivity, thereby highlighting an enhanced sensitivity of the orbital transport to the underlying band topology. For completeness, we briefly discuss the scenario corresponding to a N\'eel-ordered spin alignment, which leads to a vanishing Chern number and consequently suppressed thermal Hall and orbital Nernst conductivities compared to the zigzag-ordered case, even in the presence of DMI and Kitaev interactions.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics of a finite-thickness conducting cylindrical shell: coupled elliptic-kernel integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an exact electrostatic formulation for a finite-length conducting cylindrical shell of finite thickness separating two dielectric media with arbitrary permittivity contrast. The boundary-value problem is reduced to a coupled system of singular integral equations with elliptic kernels governing the induced surface-charge densities on the inner and outer faces. High-accuracy numerical solutions are combined with a systematic asymptotic analysis that elucidates the interplay between geometry, thickness, and dielectric contrast. All classical limiting regimes are recovered, including the slender-body limit, the short-cylinder (ring-like) asymptote, and the thick-shell regime dominated by the outer surface. We demonstrate that the logarithmic short-cylinder behavior of zero-thickness models is a singular feature, which is regularized for any finite thickness, giving rise instead to a finite capacitance plateau. The asymptotic structure of the coupled equations explains both the electrostatic decoupling of the inner cavity in the thick-shell limit and the redistribution of charge between the two surfaces. The results provide exact benchmarks for finite cylindrical conductors, bridging classical analytical treatments and modern numerical approaches, and furnish a high-accuracy reference solution for the validation of axisymmetric electrostatic solvers.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Sound Excitations in Nematic Aerogel in superfluid 3He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nematic aerogel (nAG) supports so-called polar phase in liquid 3He. The experiments by [Dmitriev et al, JETP Lett. 112, 780 (2020)] showed that the onset of polar phase inside the nAG is accompanied by emergence of a sound wave with frequency quickly growing with cooling down from transition temperature and reaching a plateau. To describe this behavior, we start by calculating the elastic properties of the dry nematic AG that appear to depend only on Young's modulus of the parent material (e.g. mullite), the volume fraction of the solid phase and the aspect ratio of the representative volume of nAG. The elastic constants are then used to solve elasto-hydrodynamic equations for various sound vibrations of nAG filled with 3He. The (isotropic) first sound and anisotropic second sound in the polar phase are strongly hybridized with fourth sound and standard elastic modes in nAG. The hybrid second and the transverse fourth sound start with zero velocity at the transition, similar to pure 3He, and quickly grow with lowering temperature until they hit the sample finite size cutoff.</description>

      <title>Interference-Controlled Radiative Heat Transport in Time-Modulated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate programmable photonic control of radiative heat transport in nanoscale networks through phase-controlled interference between elastic and inelastic Floquet scattering channels induced by temporal permittivity modulation. Relative modulation phases select constructive or destructive interference, enabling directional thermal-photon currents and heat splitting even at thermal equilibrium. Modulation amplitude and frequency further tune the enhancement, suppression and redistribution of energy flow. This interference-based mechanism enables thermal routing and logic operations and provides a general platform for reconfigurable photonic heat management at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals CrSBr alloys with tunable magnetic and optical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are attracting a lot of attention for their potential integration in spintronic and magnonic technologies. CrSBr is an A-type antiferromagnet that shows a coupling between its electronic band structure and magnetic properties. This property is appealing for applications and it also offers the possibility to investigate magnetic ground states and GHz magnons using visible optics techniques. Using Raman scattering and (magneto)-optical experiments, we describe the magnetic and optical properties of alloys of CrSBr$_{(1-x)}$Cl$_x$ with $x&lt;0.46$. Similar to CrSBr, these alloys are direct band gap semiconductors with a coupling of their electronic and magnetic properties. Exciton energies evolve weakly with composition and we describe the large changes in the saturation magnetic fields and their implications on the magnetic properties. We show that both the interlayer magnetic exchange and electronic interactions are modified by the halogen mixing, offering the possibility to tune magnon energies with alloy composition.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode effect in fractal superconductors: fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau theory for Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for nonreciprocal superconducting transport in Josephson junctions formed by fractal superconductors or superconducting media with nonlocal correlations, separated by a noncentrosymmetric normal layer. We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the low-energy electronic structure of the triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ through quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification, control and theoretical modelling of spin-triplet superconductors (STC) remain a central theme in quantum materials research. Intrinsic STC are rare but offer rich condensate properties and unique surface properties allowing insights into the nature of the spin-triplet order, and promising applications in quantum technologies. Owing to interactions, the order parameter in STCs can often be intertwined with other symmetry breaking orders like charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) or pair density waves (PDW) complicating their phase diagrams. UTe2 stands out as the only known odd-parity, STC that harbors such intertwined orders on the surface and possible topological surface states composed of Majorana fermions. While the (0-11) facet is the most heavily studied, the fermiology of this surface that gives rise to such exotic phenomena is still lacking and continues to be an area of active interest. Here, we employ low-temperature spectroscopic imaging to reveal the Fermi surface of UTe2 through quasiparticle interference. We find scattering originating from the uranium-derived bands that play a major role in the formation of the CDW and the PDW phases. Tunneling spectroscopy further reveals spectral signatures of the CDW gap, corroborating its onset temperature. Suppressing the CDW with a magnetic field, highlights the presence of small, circular Fermi pockets that disperse strongly near the Fermi energy. We discuss the nature of the interference patterns and the origin of the small Fermi pockets in the context of the calculated band structure and the unconventional CDW phase.</description>

      <title>Demagnetization in micromagnetics: magnetostatic self-interactions of bulk chiral magnetic skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical and numerical framework for three-dimensional bulk chiral magnets that includes the full magnetostatic dipole-dipole interaction and its back-reaction on the magnetization. Assuming translational invariance along one spatial direction, we analyze the effect of dipolar interactions on three Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI) terms -- Dresselhaus, Rashba, and Heusler -- corresponding to Bloch, N\'eel, and antiskyrmion textures. In the absence of the dipolar interaction, these three DMI terms are gauge-equivalent and yield degenerate skyrmion energies. Incorporating the non-local dipole-dipole interaction breaks this degeneracy: Bloch skyrmions remain unaffected, N\'eel skyrmions shrink slightly, and Heusler antiskyrmions lose axial symmetry and stabilize into square-lattice crystals. The system is solved using a non-local numerical relaxation method that self-consistently computes the magnetostatic potential from Poisson's equation. Our results show that long-range dipolar interactions can stabilize bulk antiskyrmion crystals in translationally invariant three-dimensional chiral magnets.</description>

Abstract: Hole spin qubits in Ge/GeSi heterostructures benefit from the clean environment of epitaxial interfaces and from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling that enables efficient electrical control, which makes them promising candidates for quantum computation. However, spin-orbit coupling also enhances the sensitivity to electrical disorder, potentially increasing variability. In this work, we perform numerical simulations in a realistic device geometry to quantify the variability of the charge and spin properties of Ge qubits induced by charge traps at the SiGe/oxide interfaces. We show that while the variability of charge properties remains moderate, spin properties (g-factors and Rabi frequencies) show significant dispersion. We explore the implications of this variability for large-scale architectures, and provide guidelines to minimize variability both in terms of interface quality requirements and optimal operation strategies.</description>

      <title>Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Spin currents can carry either spin angular momentum or its associated magnetic moment, which are no longer strictly proportional in multiband systems. Using a multiband $k \cdot p$ model, we compute the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity tensors of elemental Bi. The magnetic-moment tensor emerges about two orders of magnitude larger and far less anisotropic than the angular-momentum tensor, while quasiparticle damping activates otherwise longitudinal components. The magnetic-moment spin Hall angle exceeds unity, demonstrating that a clear distinction between the two currents is indispensable for multiband systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure membranes with a metasurface made up of a grating of two-dimensional electron system (2DES) strips. Experiments have revealed a strong plasma resonance in the transmission of the metasurface. We have found that a collective effect from the superlattice, along with lateral screening between the strips, leads to the emergence of a new plasmon mode in the metasurface under study. Furthermore, we develop an analytical approach that accurately describes the behavior of the discovered superlattice plasmon mode, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of plasmonic metasurface systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC) due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges that hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric switching, direct, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the simulated TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high current density and a remarkable on-off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC applications.</description>

Abstract: A topological insulator is regarded as an ideal candidate for information storage and high-speed lossless electrical transmission devices due to robust topological protected boundary modes. Previous studies revealed that symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders of its boundary modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of a topological insulator. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this symmetry-imposed constraint on a topological insulator. By applying periodic driving on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order boundary modes are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological insulators with coexisting first-order helical boundary modes and second-order corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single gap are generated easily by periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an avenue for the creation of exotic topological insulators without altering symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: We formulate gradient flow dynamics generated by two natural actions of the quantum metric for an isolated set of Bloch bands. Specializing to two spatial dimensions, we derive Bogomolny-type lower bounds that relate these actions to the Chern number and show that the bounds are saturated by (anti-)holomorphic projector configurations. Along the flows, the actions decrease monotonically while the Chern number is conserved, giving a constructive route to simplify models within a fixed topological phase toward canonical, low-complexity representatives.</description>

      <title>Linear magnetoresistance of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear magnetoresistance is a hallmark of 3D Weyl metals in the quantum limit. Recently, a pronounced linear magnetoresistance has also been observed in 2D graphene [Xin et al., Nature 616, 270 (2023)]. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive. By employing the self-consistent Born approximation, we derive the analytical expressions for the magnetoresistivity of 2D massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit. Notably, our result recovers the minimum conductivity in the clean limit and reveals a linear dependence of resistivity on the magnetic field for Gaussian impurity potentials, in quantitative agreement with experiments. These findings shed light on the magnetoresistance behavior of 2D Dirac fermions under ultra-high magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the reduction of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) size under an external magnetic field within a classical nucleation theory framework combined with a sphere-packing description of atomic assembly. The model incorporates magnetic free-energy contributions arising from the coupling between the applied field and the magnetic susceptibility of the nucleating material, yielding a closed-form relation between nanoparticle radius and field strength. Our approach reproduces the experimentally observed decrease in the most-probable particle radius from approximately 170 nm at 49.27 mT when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the stirring plane, and to 155 nm at 180.78 mT in the perpendicular configuration. Across the investigated field range, the theoretical predictions remain consistent with experimental measurements obtained under continuous mechanical stirring, supporting the interpretation that the observed size reduction originates from a magnetic-field-induced modification of the nucleation free-energy landscape. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the results provide a physically transparent and computationally efficient framework for understanding magnetic-field-controlled nanoparticle size selection.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric tensors from sub-bundle geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states are crucial for understanding many physical phenomena in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and optics. The central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor, which unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use the differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the properties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum geometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on a general connection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum state transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which constrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle geometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is described by generalized Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This leads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor that contains an additional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the sub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields propagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with its additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete example, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and demonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry. This work sets the stage for further exploration of quantum systems in curved geometries, with applications in both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems.</description>

Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system operates as a quantum heat engine across the range of parameters considered. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent Transport Studies of Fe/Mo$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$S$_2$/Fe Magnetic Tunnel Junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, spin dependent electron transport in Fe/Mo$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$S$_2$/Fe magnetic tunnel junction is studied. Spin transport for different thicknesses (1, 3, 5, and 7 layers) of the spacer MoS2 and for two different surface orientations of the Fe electrode, the Fe(001) and Fe(111) surface and with substitutional doping of 3d transition metal Cr at Mo site in MoS2 is investigated. The electronic structure of the heterostructure shows the presence of metal-induced states in the semiconducting MoS2 at the Fe/MoS2/Fe interface. The I-V characteristics of the junctions for the monolayer and three layer MoS2 spacer show linear behaviour due to the metallic nature of the junction. The tunnelling nature of the junction is observed for the thicker junctions with five-layer and seven layer spacers. With the introduction of magnetic impurity Cr, the tunnelling magnetoresistance for 7-layer junction is reduced. The Cr-defect states are observed below the conduction band, and the Cr-doped devices are stable up to a bias of 0.5V. Spin-transport through close-packed Fe(111) surface as electrode show low GMR value.</description>

      <title>Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.</description>
