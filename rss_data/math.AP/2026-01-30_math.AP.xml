      <title>Global oscillatory solutions for the Yang-Mills heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics for the global solution of the $SO(4)$-equivariant Yang-Mills heat flow (YMHF) with structure group $SU(2)$ in space dimension $4$. For a class of initial data with specific decay at spatial infinity, we prove that the long-time dynamics of YMHF can be described by the initial data in a unified manner. As a consequence, the global solutions can exhibit blow-up, blow-down, and more exotically, {\it oscillatory} asymptotic behavior at time infinity. This seems to be the first example of Yang-Mills heat flows with oscillatory behavior as $t\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Classical solutions to the Boltzmann equations for gas mixture with unequal molecular masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation is essential for gas thermodynamics,as it models how the molecular density distribution $F(t,x,v)$ changes over time. However, existing research primarily focuses on the single species Boltzmann equation, while investigations into gas mixtures with unequal molecular masses remain relatively limited. Notably, mixed gas studies have broader applications exemplified by Earth's atmosphere, composed of 78\% nitrogen, 21\% oxygen, and 1\% trace gases, where the $N_2$ to $O_2$ molecular mass ratio is 28:32 (simplified as 7:8). This work addresses the Boltzmann equations for such mixtures with unequal molecular masses $(m^A\neq m^B)$, establishing the global in time existence of classical solutions near Maxwellians for soft potentials ($-3&lt;\gamma&lt;0$) in a periodic spatial domain. Our analysis encompasses arbitrary molecular mass ratios. Our analysis encompasses arbitrary molecular mass ratios. The main contribution of this paper lies in the detailed characterization of the linear collision operator's structure and establishing estimates for the nonlinear terms under unequal mass conditions. Consequently, these results may help advance spectral analysis for soft potentials as well as $L^2,L^{\infty}$ frameworks in future studies of multi-component Boltzmann equations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit of the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system for gas mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic limit of the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system for a gas mixture in the whole space $(x \in \mathbb{R}^3)$ with the potential range of $\gamma \in\left(-3, 1\right]$. Using the method of Hilbert expansion, we first derive a bi-Maxwellian determined by the Euler-Poisson system of two fluids. To justify the convergence of the solution rigorously as the Knudsen number tends to zero, we sequentially calculate the first $2k-1$ terms of the expansion series $(k \geq 6)$, and then truncate it, and express the solution as the sum of these first $2k-1$ terms and a remainder term. Within the framework of the $L_{x,v}^2-W_{x,v}^{1,\infty}$ interplay established by Guo and Jang \cite{[ininp]Guo2010CMP}, we construct a new weight function to estimate the remainder term in four different cases regarding the potential $\gamma$. Here, the particle masses $m^A, m^B &gt; 0$ and their charges $e^A, e^B$ can be given arbitrarily. This causes the collision operator to exhibit asymmetric effects ($m^A \neq m^B$), rendering the system of equations impossible to decouple. So, it adds difficulties to both $L^2$, $L^{\infty}$ estimates for the remainder. Therefore, we adopt the framework of vector-valued functions and analyze the velocity decay rate of the operator $K_{M,2,w}^{\alpha,c}$ to eliminate the singularity induced by small parameters in characteristic line iterations. Our results show that the validity time of the solution is $O(\varepsilon^{-y})$, where $y$ is $-\frac{2k-3}{2(2k-1)}$ when $-1 \leq \gamma \leq 1$, and it becomes $-\frac{2k-3}{(1-\gamma)(2k-1)}$, when $-3 &lt; \gamma &lt; -1$. These results possess strong physical realism and can be applied to analyze gas flow dynamics in the daytime ionosphere at high altitudes above the Earth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem of the Geng-Xue system with cubic nonlinearity. Firstly, we prove a blow-up criteria in the low besov space. Secondly, we prove the blow-up phenomenon by using the method which does not require any conservation law. Finally, we extend our results to the b-family of two-component system with cubic nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness and dynamics of two types of reaction--nonlocal diffusion systems under the inhomogeneous spectral fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactio-nonlocal diffusion equations model nonlocal transport and anomalous diffusion by replacing the Laplacian with a fractional power, capturing diffusion mechanisms beyond Brownian motion. We primarily study the semilinear problem \[ \partial_t u + \epsilon^2(-\Delta)_g^\alpha u = \mathcal{N}(u) \] allowing constant inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition $u|_{\partial\Omega}=g$. To handle the boundary constraint, we use a harmonic lifting to reformulate the problem as an equivalent homogeneous system with a shifted nonlinearity. Working in \(C_0(\Omega)\), analytic contraction semigroup theory yields the Duhamel formula and quantitative smoothing, implying local wellposedness for locally Lipschitz reactions and a blow-up alternative. The semigroup viewpoint also provides $L^\infty$-contractivity and positivity preservation, which drive pointwise maximum principles and stability bounds. Furthermore, we analyze two prototypes. For the bistable RNDE, we derive an energy dissipation identity and, using a fractional weak maximum principle, obtain an invariant-range property that confines solutions between the two stable steady states. For the nonlocal Gray-Scott system with possibly different fractional diffusion orders, we prove that solutions preserve positivity. Moreover, we identify an explicit \(L^\infty\) invariant set ensuring global boundedness, and derive an eigenfunction-weighted interior \(L^2\) bound. Finally, we perform numerical simulations using a sine pseudospectral discretization and ETDRK4 time-stepping, which the impact of fractional orders on pattern formation, consistent with our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Multistatic anisotropic travel-time as a tensor tomography problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Travel-time imaging problems seek to reconstruct an image of reflectivity of a scene by measuring travel time (and amplitude, phase) of electromagnetic or acoustic signals, such as radar and sonar. Multistatic, in this context, means that the transmitters and receivers need not be co-located. The reflectivity is anisotropic if it depends on direction, and in the multistatic case this means incoming and outgoing direction. Travel-time problems can be formulated as generalized Radon transforms of integrals over isochrones, in the planar case ellipses with transmitter and receivers at foci. In a simplified case where transmitters and receivers are distant from the scene, isochrones can be approximated by straight lines. We relate this to tensor ray transforms, specifically the longitudinal ray transform of Sharafutdinov, and discuss the implication of its known null-space. In the volumetric case isochrones are spheroids and we relate the problem to the normal Radon transform of tensor fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the regime-switching diffusion process with and without advection term we propose an integro-differential equation describing the densities of states continuously distributed over a segment. We demonstrate that there exists a constructive algorithm for solving the Cauchy problem. We then show that for some initial distributions of states, the solution can be found explicitly. We also discuss how a model with a discrete number of hidden states can be approximated by a model with continuously distributed states.</description>

      <title>Nonhomogeneous boundary condition for spectral non-local operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semilinear non-local elliptic problems driven by spectral-type operators of the form $\psi(-L_{|D})$ in a bounded $C^{1,1}$ domain $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with a nonhomogeneous boundary condition. Here $\psi$ is a Bernstein function satisfying a weak scaling condition at infinity, and $L_{|D}$ is the generator of a killed L\'evy process. This general framework covers and extends the theory of the interpolated fractional Laplacian. A key novelty in this setting is the analysis of the nonhomogeneous boundary condition formulated in terms of the Poisson potential with respect to the $d-1$ Hausdorff measure on $\partial D$. We establish sharp boundary estimates for Green and Poisson potentials, introduce a weak $L^1$ trace-like boundary operator, and provide existence results for solutions under quite general nonlinearities, including sign-changing and non-monotone cases. The methodology combines stochastic process techniques, potential theory, and spectral analysis, and expresses the boundary behavior of the solution in terms of the renewal function and the distance to the boundary, suggesting a possible unified treatment of semilinear boundary problems in non-local settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the past nonlinear stability of the sub-critical Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations on a truncated cone domain in spacetime dimensions $n\geq4$. Our analysis demonstrates that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete in the contracting direction and terminate at quiescent and crushing singularities characterized by the blow-up of curvature invariants. This work generalizes the result of Beyer-Oliynyk-Zheng in [arXiv:2502.09210v2] to all higher dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Unique Continuation Property for Stochastic Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental and surprising phenomenon in the theory of stochastic wave equations: the restoration of the unique continuation property (UCP) across characteristic hypersurfaces, a property that is known to fail generically in the deterministic setting. We prove that if a solution to a linear stochastic wave equation vanishes on one side of a characteristic surface $\Gamma$, then it must vanish in a full neighborhood of any point on $\Gamma$, provided the stochastic diffusion coefficient is non-degenerate. This result stands in sharp contrast to the classical H\"ormander-type counterexamples for deterministic waves.
  Furthermore, we extend the UCP to equations with non-homogeneous stochastic sources and establish a global unique continuation result from the interior of an arbitrarily narrow characteristic cone. Our proofs rely on a novel stochastic Carleman estimate, where the It\^o diffusion term introduces a crucial positive energy contribution that is absent in deterministic models.
  These findings demonstrate a qualitative difference between deterministic and stochastic hyperbolic dynamics and open new avenues for control theory and inverse problems in stochastic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of probabilistically strong, measure-valued solutions for the stochastic incompressible Navier--Stokes equations and prove their convergence, in the vanishing viscosity limit, to probabilistically strong solutions for the stochastic incompressible Euler equations. In particular, this solves the open problem of constructing probabilistically strong solutions for the stochastic Euler equations that satisfy the energy inequality for general $L^2$ initial data. We introduce the concept of energy-variational solutions in the stochastic context in order to treat the nonlinearities without changing the probability space. Furthermore, we extend these results to fluids driven by transport noise.</description>

      <title>On Global Weak Solutions for the Magnetic Two-Component Hunter-Saxton System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS), which was recently derived in \cite{M24} as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional configuration space. While the geometric framework and the global weak flow were outlined there, the present paper provides the analytical foundations of this construction from the PDE perspective.
  First, we derive an explicit solution formula in Lagrangian variables via a Riccati reduction, yielding an alternative proof of the blow-up criterion together with an explicit expression for the blow-up time. Second, we rigorously construct global conservative weak solutions by developing the analytic theory of the relaxed configuration space and the associated weak magnetic geodesic flow, thereby realizing the geometric program proposed in \cite{M24}.</description>

      <title>Microlocal maximal hypoellipticity from the geometric viewpoint: I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given some vector fields on a smooth manifold satisfying H\"ormander's condition, we define a bi-graded pseudo-differential calculus which contains the classical pseudo-differential calculus and a pseudo-differential calculus adapted to the sub-Riemannian structure induced by the vector fields.
  Our approach is based on geometric constructions (resolution of singularities) together with methods from operators algebras. We develop this calculus in full generality, including Sobolev spaces, the wavefront set, and the principal symbol, etc.
  In particular, using this calculus, we prove that invertibility of the principal symbol implies microlocal maximal hypoellipticity. This allows us to resolve affirmatively the microlocal version of a conjecture of Helffer and Nourrigat.</description>

      <title>PILD: Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools for modeling complex data distributions, yet their purely data-driven nature limits applicability in practical engineering and scientific problems where physical laws need to be followed. This paper proposes Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion (PILD), a framework that unifies diffusion modeling and first-principles physical constraints by introducing a virtual residual observation sampled from a Laplace distribution to supervise generation during training. To further integrate physical laws, a conditional embedding module is incorporated to inject physical information into the denoising network at multiple layers, ensuring consistent guidance throughout the diffusion process. The proposed PILD framework is concise, modular, and broadly applicable to problems governed by ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, as well as algebraic equations or inequality constraints. Extensive experiments across engineering and scientific tasks including estimating vehicle trajectories, tire forces, Darcy flow and plasma dynamics, demonstrate that our PILD substantially improves accuracy, stability, and generalization over existing physics-informed and diffusion-based baselines.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral analysis of operators in heterogeneous and aging media typically requires a functional framework that extends beyond the standard Hilbertian setting. In this paper, we establish a rigorous distributional theory for a class of non-local operators, termed Weighted Weyl-Sonine operators, by employing a structure-preserving transmutation method. We construct the Weighted Schwartz Space $\mathcal{S}_{\psi,\omega}$ and its topological dual, the space of Weighted Tempered Distributions $\mathcal{S}'_{\psi,\omega}$, ensuring that the underlying Fr\'echet topology is consistent with the infinitesimal generator of the aging dynamics. This topological foundation allows us to: (i) extend the Weighted Fourier Transform to generalized functions as a unitary isomorphism; (ii) provide an explicit spectral characterization of the weighted Dirac delta $\delta_{\psi,\omega}$ and its scaling laws under geometric dilations; and (iii) introduce a scale of Weighted Sobolev Spaces $H^{s}_{\psi,\omega}$ defined via spectral multipliers. A central result is the derivation of a sharp embedding theorem, $|u(t)| \le C \omega(t)^{-1} \|u\|_{H^s_{\psi,\omega}}$, which rigorously connects abstract spectral energy to the pointwise decay induced by the weight $\omega$. This framework provides a unified geometric characterization of several fractional regimes, including the Hadamard and Riemann-Liouville cases, within a single operator-theoretic architecture.</description>

      <title>Navier-Stokes with a fractional transport noise as a limit of multi-scale dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a bona fide rough path solution for the Navier-Stokes equation with an additional rough transport term, and show that the SPDE on the three-dimensional torus driven by a fractional Brownian motion on $H^\sigma$ has solutions characterised as the effective limits of a slow/fast system. We further show that this rough path solution is equivalent to the widely used incremental notion of solution (the unbounded rough driver formulation), demonstrating broader applicability to other nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Scattering laws for interfaces in self-gravitating matter flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of self-gravitating matter fields that may undergo phase transitions, and we connect ideas from phase transition dynamics with concepts from bouncing cosmology. Our framework introduces scattering maps prescribed on two classes of hypersurfaces: a gravitational singularity hypersurface and a fluid-discontinuity hypersurface. By analyzing the causal structures induced by the light cone and the acoustic cone, we formulate a local evolution problem for the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of such interfaces. We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G. Veneziano for quiescent (velocity-dominated) singularities in solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field, where the passage across the singular hypersurface is encoded by a singularity scattering map. The guiding question is to identify junction prescriptions that are compatible with the Einstein and Euler equations, in particular with the propagation of constraints. The outcome is a rigid set of universal relations, together with a family of model-dependent parameters. Under physically motivated requirements (general covariance, causality, constraint compatibility, and ultra-locality), we aim to classify admissible scattering relations arising from microscopic physics and characterizing, at the macroscopic level, the dynamics of a fluid coupled to Einstein gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ergodic behaviour of the McKean-Vlasov equations driven by common, divergence-free transport noise. In particular, we show that in dimension $d\geq 2$, if the noise is mixing and sufficiently strong it can enforce the uniqueness of invariant probability measures, even if the deterministic part of equation has multiple steady states.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion and anomalous regularization in self-similar random incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of a particle in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \geq 2$, subject to molecular diffusion and advection by a random incompressible flow. The velocity field is the divergence of a stationary random stream matrix $\mathbf{k} $ with positive Hurst exponent $\gamma &gt; 0$, so the resulting random environment is multiscale and self-similar. In the perturbative regime $\gamma \ll 1$, we prove quenched power-law superdiffusion: for a typical realization of the environment, the displacement variance at time $t$ grows like $t^{2/(2-\gamma)}$, the scaling predicted by renormalization group heuristics. We also identify the leading prefactor up to a random (quenched) relative error of order $\gamma^{\frac12}\left| \log \gamma \right|^3$. The proof implements a Wilsonian renormalization group scheme at the level of the infinitesimal generator $\nabla \cdot (\nu I_d + \mathbf{k} ) \nabla$, based on a self-similar induction across scales. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained generator is well-approximated, at each scale $r$, by a constant-coefficient Laplacian with effective diffusivity growing like $r^\gamma$. This approximation is inherently scale-local: reflecting the multifractal nature of the environment, the relative error does not decay with the scale, but remains of order $\gamma^{\frac12}\left| \log \gamma \right|^2$. We also prove anomalous regularization under the quenched law: for almost every realization of the drift, solutions of the associated elliptic equation are H\"older continuous with exponent $1 - C\gamma^{\frac12}$ and satisfy estimates which are uniform in the molecular diffusivity $\nu$ and the scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1811.05136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem of the quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} iu_t=\Delta u+2uh'(|u|^2)\Delta h(|u|^2)+F(|u|^2)u \quad {\rm for} \ x\in \mathbb{R}^N, \ t&gt;0\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x),\quad x\in \mathbb{R}^N. \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} Here $h(s)$ and $F(s)$ are some real-valued functions, with various choices for models from mathematical physics. We examine the interplay between the quasilinear effect of $h$ and nonlinear effect of $F$ for the global existence and blowup phenomena. We provide sufficient conditions on the blowup in finite time and global existence of the solution. In some cases, we can deduce the watershed from these conditions. In the focusing case, we construct the sharp threshold for the blowup in finite time and global existence of the solution and lower bound for blowup rate of the blowup solution.</description>

      <title>Global Existence for the unstable Cahn-Hilliard equation in 2D with a Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.05299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the advective unstable Cahn-Hilliard equation in 2D with shear flow: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} u_t+Av_1(y) \partial_x u+\varepsilon \Delta^2 u= \Delta(a u^3+ b u^2) \quad &amp; \quad \textrm{on} \quad \mathbb T^2; \\ \\ u \ \textrm{periodic} \quad &amp; \quad \textrm{on} \quad \partial \mathbb T^2, \end{cases} \end{equation*} with an initial data $u_0 \in H_0^2(\mathbb T^2)$, where $\mathbb T^2$ is the two-dimensional torus, $A, \varepsilon&gt;0$, $a&lt;0$, $b \in \mathbb R$. Under the assumption that the shear has a finite number of critical points and there are linearly growing modes only in the direction of the shear, we show the $L^2$-energy of the solutions to such problems converges expotentially to zero, if in addition, both $|a|$ and $\left\| \int_{\mathbb T} u_0(x, \cdot ) dx \right\|_{L_y^2}$ are sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>Global weak solution of 3-D focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the existence of global weak solutions to the three-dimensional focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation in the non-radial case. Furthermore, we prove the weak-strong uniqueness for some class of initial data. The main ingredient of our new approach is to use solutions of an energy-critical Ginzburg-Landau equation as approximations for the corresponding nonlinear Sch\"ordinger equation.
  In our proofs, we first show the dichotomy of global well-posedness versus finite time blow-up of energy-critical Ginzburg-Landau equation in $\dot{H}^1( \mathbb{R}^d)$ for $d = 3,4 $ when the energy is less than the energy of the stationary solution $W$. We follow the strategy of C. E. Kenig and F. Merle [25,26], using a concentration-compactness/rigidity argument to reduce the global well-posedness to the exclusion of a critical element. The critical element is ruled out by dissipation of the Ginzburg-Landau equation, including local smoothness, backwards uniqueness and unique continuation. The existence of global weak solution of the three dimensional focusing energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the non-radial case then follows from the global well-posedness of the energy-critical Ginzburg-Landau equation via a limitation argument. We also adapt the arguments of M. Struwe [37,38] to prove the weak-strong uniqueness when the $\dot{H}^1$-norm of the initial data is bounded by a constant depending on the stationary solution $W$.</description>

Abstract: We show an example of a sequence of elliptic operators in the unit ball with drifts that diverge as the inverse distance to the boundary, for which we do not get uniform upper estimates for the Green's function with the pole at the origin. Such drifts have been considered in the literature in the study of the $L^{p}$ Dirichlet problem for both the parabolic and elliptic operators. Our construction provides a counterexample to an earlier claim of Hofmann and Lewis.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy Problem For Quasi-Linear Parabolic Systems Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of parabolic quasilinear systems, in which the diffusion matrix is not uniformly elliptic, but satisfies a Petrovskii condition of positivity of the real part of the eigenvalues. Local well-posedness is known since the work of Amann in the 90s, by a semi-group method. We first revisit these results in the context of Sobolev spaces modelled on $L^2$ and then explore the endpoint Besov case $B_{p,1}^{d/p}$. We also exemplify our method on the SKT system, showing the existence of local, non-negative, strong solutions.</description>

      <title>A note for double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof for the interior double H\"{o}lder regularity of the hydrodynamic pressure for weak solutions of the Euler Equations in a bounded $C^2$-domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$; $d\geq 3$. That is, for velocity $u \in C^{0,\gamma}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^d)$ with some $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1/2$, we show that the pressure $p \in C^{0,2\gamma}_{\rm int}(\Omega)$. This is motivated by the studies of turbulence and anomalous dissipation in mathematical hydrodynamics and, recently, has been established in [L. De Rosa, M. Latocca, and G. Stefani, Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024.3 (2024), 2511--2560] over $C^{2,1}$-domains by means of pseudodifferential calculus. Our approach involves only standard elliptic PDE techniques, and relies on a variant of the modified pressure introduced in [C. W. Bardos, D. W. Boutros, and E. S. Titi, H\"{o}lder regularity of the pressure for weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations in bounded domains, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 249 (2025), 28] and the potential estimates in [L. Silvestre, unpublished notes]. The key novel ingredient of our proof is the introduction of two cutoff functions whose localisation parameters are carefully chosen as a power of the distance to $\partial\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation in a moving domain under a Neumann type boundary condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation with $p&gt;2$ in a moving domain under a Neumann type boundary condition corresponding to the total mass conservation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution by the Galerkin method in evolving Bochner spaces and a monotonicity argument. The main difficulty is in characterizing the weak limit of the nonlinear gradient term, where we need to deal with a term which comes from the boundary condition and cannot be absorbed into a monotone operator. To overcome this difficulty, we prove a uniform-in-time Friedrichs type inequality on a moving domain with time-dependent basis functions and make use of it to get the strong convergence of approximate solutions. We also show that the time derivative exists in the $L^2$ sense when given data have a better regularity, and discuss extension of the existence and uniqueness results to a Leray-Lions type operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a kinetic model that couples the movement of a population of individuals with the dynamics of a pathogen in the same population. We consider that transmission occurs when a susceptible and an infectious individual are sufficiently close for a sufficiently long time. We show that the model is formally compatible with the well-known SIRS model in mathematical epidemiology. Namely, after identifying an appropriate dimensionless variable and considering the limit when that variable is small, we introduce a partial differential equation model of advection-drift-diffusion type (mesoscopic model), which for spatially homogeneous solutions reduces to the SIRS model. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions in appropriate spaces for particular instances of the model. We finish with some examples and discuss possible applications and generalisation of this modelling approach, linking kinetic models, evolutionary game theory, and mathematical epidemiology.</description>

Abstract: We study a fluid-structure interaction problem between a viscous incompressible fluid and an elastic beam with fixed endpoints in a static setting. The 3D fluid domain is bounded, nonsmooth and non simply connected, the fluid is modeled by the stationary Navier-Stokes equations subject to inflow/outflow conditions. The structure is modeled by a stationary 1D beam equation with a load density involving the force exerted by the fluid and, thereby, may vary its position. In a smallness regime, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the PDE-ODE coupled system.</description>

Abstract: We consider Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators with general degenerate coefficients. We prove semiclassical hypocoercivity estimates for a large class of such operators. Then, we manage to prove Eyring-Kramers formulas for the bottom of the spectrum of some particular degenerate operators in the semiclassical regime, and quantify the spectral gap separating these eigenvalues from the rest of the spectrum. The main ingredient is the construction of sharp Gaussian quasimodes through an adaptation of the WKB method.</description>

      <title>A sharp criterion and complete classification of global-in-time solutions and finite time blow-up of solutions to a chemotaxis system in supercritical dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in the whole space, \begin{equation}\label{abst:p}\tag{$\star$} \begin{cases} u_t = \Delta u - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v),\\ 0 = \Delta v + w,\\ w_t = \Delta w + u \end{cases} \end{equation} with emphasis on supercritical dimensions. In contrast to the classical parabolic-elliptic Keller--Segel system, where the analysis can be reduced to a single equation, the above system is essentially parabolic-parabolic and does not admit such a reduction. In this paper, we establish a sharp threshold phenomenon separating global-in-time existence from finite time blow-up in terms of scaling-critical Morrey norms of the initial data. In particular, we prove the existence of singular stationary solutions and show that their Morrey norm values serve as the critical thresholds determining the long-time behavior of solutions. Consequently, we identify new critical exponents at which the long-time behavior of solutions changes. This yields a complete classification of the long-time behavior of solutions, providing the first such results for the essentially parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system \eqref{abst:p} in supercritical dimensions.</description>
