      <title>Crisis in time-dependent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems operate in a fluctuating environment. However, even in low-dimensional setups, transitions and bifurcations have not yet been fully understood. In this Letter we focus on crises, a sudden flooding of the phase space due to the crossing of the boundary of the basin of attraction. We find that crises occur also in non-autonomous systems although the underlying mechanism is more complex. We show that in the vicinity of the transition, the escape probability scales as $\exp[-\alpha (\ln \delta)^2]$, where $\delta$ is the distance from the critical point, while $\alpha$ is a model-dependent parameter. This prediction is tested and verified in a few different systems, including the Kuramoto model with inertia, where the crisis controls the loss of stability of a chimera state.</description>

      <title>Echo state property and memory capacity of artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing by using artificial spin ice (ASI) has been proposed on the basis of both numerical and experimental analyses. ASI is a many-body system consisting of ferromagnets with various interactions. Recently, fabricating magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as ferromagnets in an ASI was achieved in the experiment, which enables an electrical detection of magnetic state of each MTJ independently. However, performing a recognition task of time-dependent signal by such an MTJ-based ASI has not been reported yet. In this work, we examine numerical simulation of a recognition task of time-dependent input and evaluate short-term memory and parity-check capacities. These capacities change significantly when the magnitude of the input magnetic field is comparable to a value around which the magnetization alignment is greatly affected by the dipole interaction. It implies that the presence of the dipole interaction results in a loss of echo state property. This point was clarified by evaluating Lyapunov exponent and confirming that the drastic change of the memory capacities appears near the boundary between negative and zero exponents, which corresponds to the edge of echo state property.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via nonlocal visual interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09917v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this paper, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</description>

      <title>Extreme events at the onset of epileptic-like intermittent activity of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators on small-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of coupling strength, network size, and randomness on the collective dynamics of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators on complex networks. Using Watts-Strogatz small-world network connectivities, we identify four distinct dynamical phases: chaotic, intermittent, partially synchronized, and fully synchronized. The intermittent phase is characterized by the coexistence of chaotic behavior and chimera states, reminiscent of epileptic-seizure-related (ESR) intermittency observed in the brain. We analyze the inter-spike intervals of the individual oscillators, and the existence, duration, and frequency of ESR events as a function of the system parameters. Furthermore, we study the transitions into and out of the intermittent phase and show that peaks in the probability of extreme events--short transients of anomalously high synchronization--precede the transitions from chaos to intermittency and from partial to full synchronization. These transitions are followed by significant changes in the maximum Lyapunov exponent and Kaplan-Yorke dimension. Finally, we discuss how the coupling strength and network properties can be leveraged to control the system's state and the potential applications of extreme event analysis in the study of neural data.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: Evolutionary Dynamics of Deception in a Sender-Receiver Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation poses a significant threat to societal well-being. We analyze this phenomenon using an evolutionary game theory model of the sender-receiver game, where senders aim to mislead receivers and receivers aim to discern the truth. Using a combination of replicator equations, finite-size scaling analysis, and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the long-term evolutionary dynamics of this game. Our central finding is a counterintuitive threshold phenomenon: the role (sender or receiver) with the larger difference in payoffs between successful and unsuccessful interactions is surprisingly more likely to lose in the long run. We show that this effect is robust across different parameter values and arises from the interplay between the relative speeds of evolution of the two roles and the ability of the slower evolving role to exploit the fixed strategy of the faster evolving role. Moreover, for finite populations we find that the initially less frequent strategy of the slower role is more likely to fixate in the population. The initially rarer strategy in the less-rewarded role is, paradoxically, more likely to prevail.</description>
