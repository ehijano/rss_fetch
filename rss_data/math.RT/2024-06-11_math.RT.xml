      <title>Classification of Non-Degenerate Symmetric Bilinear and Quadratic Forms in the Verlinde Category $\mathrm{Ver}_4^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Deligne's theorem classifies all symmetric tensor categories (STCs) with moderate growth over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero, the classification does not extend to positive characteristic. At the forefront of the study of STCs is the search for an analog to Deligne's theorem in positive characteristic, and it has become increasingly apparent that the Verlinde categories are to play a significant role. Moreover, these categories are largely unstudied, but have already shown very interesting phenomena as both a generalization of and a departure from superalgebra and supergeometry. In this paper, we study $\mathrm{Ver}_4^+$, the simplest non-trivial Verlinde category in characteristic $2$. In particular, we classify all isomorphism classes of non-degenerate symmetric bilinear forms and non-degenerate quadratic forms and study the associated Witt semi-ring that arises from the addition and multiplication operations on bilinear forms.</description>

      <title>Reality determining subgraphs and strongly real modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of pseudo q-factorization graphs was recently introduced by the last two authors as a combinatorial language which is suited for capturing certain properties of Drinfeld polynomials. Using certain known representation theoretic facts about tensor products of Kirillov Reshetikhin modules and qcharacters, combined with special topological/combinatorial properties of the underlying q-factorization graphs, the last two authors showed that, for algebras of type A, modules associated to totally ordered graphs are prime, while those associated to trees are real. In this paper, we extend the latter result. We introduce the notions of strongly real modules and that of trees of modules satisfying certain properties. In particular, we can consider snake trees, i.e., trees formed from snake modules. Among other results, we show that a certain class of such generalized trees, which properly contains the snake trees, give rise to strongly real modules.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give a new explicit construction of Lusztig's asymptotic algebra in affine type $\mathsf{A}$. To do so, we construct a balanced system of cell modules, prove an asymptotic version of the Plancherel Theorem and develop a relative version of the Satake Isomorphism for each two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cell.</description>

      <title>$\mathscr{D}$-modules on the basic affine space and large $\mathfrak{g}$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we treat $\mathscr{D}$-modules on the basic affine space $G/U$ and their global sections for a semisimple complex algebraic group $G$. Our aim is to prepare basic results about large non-irreducible modules for the branching problem and harmonic analysis of reductive Lie groups. A main tool is a formula given by Bezrukavnikov--Braverman--Positselskii. The formula is about a product of functions and their Fourier transforms on $G/U$ like Capelli's identity. Using the formula, we give a generalization of the Beilinson--Bernstein correspondence.
  We show that the global sections of holonomic $\mathscr{D}$-modules are also holonomic using the formula. As a consequence, we give a large algebra action on the $\mathfrak{u}$-cohomologies $H^i(\mathfrak{u}; V)$ of a $\mathfrak{g}$-module $V$ when $V$ is realized as a holonomic $\mathscr{D}$-module. We consider affinity of the supports of the $\mathfrak{t}$-modules $H^i(\mathfrak{u}; V)$.</description>

      <title>A Positivstellensatz on the Matrix Algebra of Finitely Generated Free Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positivstellens{\"a}tze are a group of theorems on the positivity of involution algebras over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. One of the most well-known Positivstellensatz is the solution to Hilbert's 17th problem given by E. Artin, which asserts that a real polynomial in $n$ commutative variables is nonnegative on real affine space if and only if it is a sum of fractional squares. Let $m$ and $n$ be two positive integers. For the free group $F_n$ generated by $n$ letters, and a symmetric polynomial $b$ with variables in $F_n$ and with $n$-by-$n$ complex matrices coefficients, we use real algebraic geometry to give a new proof showing that $b$ is a sum of Hermitian squares if and only if $b$ is mapped to a positive semidefinite matrix under any finitely dimensional unitary representation of $F_n$.</description>

      <title>Solving the index problem for (curved) Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the index theory of curved Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) sequences in parabolic geometry and their role in $K$-homology and noncommutative geometry. The BGG-sequences fit into $K$-homology, and we solve their index problem. We provide a condition for when the BGG-complex on the flat parabolic geometry $G/P$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$ fits into $G$-equivariant $K$-homology by means of Heisenberg calculus. For higher rank Lie groups, we prove a no-go theorem showing that the approach fails.</description>

      <title>Categories of Line Defects and Cohomological Hall Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any four-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory with eight supercharges can be associated to a monoidal category of BPS line defects. Any Coulomb vacuum of such a theory can be conjecturally associated to an "algebra of BPS particles'', exemplified by certain Cohomological Hall Algebras. We conjecture the existence of a monoidal functor from the category of line defects to a certain category of bimodules for the BPS Algebra in any Coulomb vacuum. We describe images of simple objects under the conjectural functor and study their monoidal structure in examples. As we vary the choice of vacuum, we expect the collection of functors associated to any given theory to capture the full information of the original monoidal category of lines.</description>

      <title>The geometry of polynomial representations in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $\mathbf{GL}$-variety is a (typically infinite dimensional) variety modeled on the polynomial representation theory of the general linear group. In previous work, we studied these varieties in characteristic 0. In this paper, we obtain results in positive characteristic: for example, we prove a version of Chevalley's theorem on constructible sets. We give an application of our theory to strength of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Geometric model for vector bundles via infinite marked strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometric model for the category of vector bundles over the weighted projective line of type (2,2,n). This model is based on the orbit space of an infinite marked strip under a specific group action. We establish a bijection between indecomposable bundles and orbits of line segments on the strip, which yields geometric interpretations for various aspects, including the Picard group action, vector bundle duality, dimension of extension group, projective cover and injective hull of extension bundle, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A higher Deligne-Lusztig representation is a virtual smooth representation of a parahoric subgroup in a $p$-adic group, which is constructed from the Deligne-Lusztig induction. In this note, under a mild condition on $p$ we provide a decomposition of higher Deligne-Lusztig representations, attached to an unramified elliptic maximal torus, into irreducible representations obtained in a similar way as those used in Yu's construction of supercuspidal representations of $p$-adic groups. As a consequence, we show that all the unramified supercuspidal representations are direct summands of inductions of higher Deligne-Lusztig representations.</description>

      <title>Quiver algebras and their representations for arbitrary quivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quiver Yangians were originally defined for the quiver and superpotential from string theory on general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and serve as BPS algebras of these systems. Their characters reproduce the unrefined BPS indices, which correspond to classical Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants. We generalize this construction in two directions. First, we show that this definition extends to arbitrary quivers with potentials. Second, we explain how to define the characters to incorporate the refined BPS indices, which correspond to motivic DT invariants. We focus on two main classes of quivers: the BPS quivers of 4D $N=2$ theories and the quivers from the knot-quiver correspondence. The entire construction allows for straightforward generalizations to trigonometric, elliptic, and generalized cohomologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Strichartz estimates for the $(k,a)$-generalized Laguerre operators $a^{-1}(-|x|^{2-a}\Delta_k+|x|^a)$ which were introduced by Ben Sa\"{\i}d-Kobayashi-{\0}rsted, and for the operators $|x|^{2-a}\Delta_k$. Here $k$ denotes a non-negative multiplicity function for the Dunkl Laplacian $\Delta_k$ and $a$ denotes a positive real number satisfying certain conditions. The cases $a=1,2$ were studied previously. We consider more general cases here. The proof depends on symbol-type estimates of special functions and a discrete analog of the stationary phase theorem inspired by the work of Ionescu-Jerison.</description>

      <title>Macdonald identities, Weyl-Kac denominator formulas and affine Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the affine Weyl denominator formulas as signed $q$-series of ordinary Weyl characters running over the affine Grassmannian. Here the grading in $q$ coincides with the (dual) atomic length of the root system considered as introduced by Chapelier-Laget and Gerber. Next, we give simple expressions of the atomic lengths in terms of self-conjugate core partitions. This permits in particular to rederive, from the general theory of affine root systems, some results of the second author obtained by case-by-case computations on determinants and the use of particular families of self-conjugate or doubled distinct partitions. These families are proved to be in simple one-to-one correspondences with families of distinct partitions and thus with the previous core partition model and, through this correspondence, the atomic length on cores equates the rank of the strict partitions considered. Finally, we make explicit some interactions between the affine Grassmannian elements and the Nekrasov--Okounkov type formulas. For the affine Weyl group of type A, this connection permits to count the cardinalities of some refinements of the inversion sets by using the hook lengths of the corresponding cores.</description>
