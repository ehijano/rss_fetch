      <title>Adversarial Text Generation with Dynamic Contextual Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models expose vulnerabilities by introducing subtle perturbations to input text, often leading to misclassification while maintaining human readability. Existing methods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations, overlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically inconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme named Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates context-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents, ensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an adversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing model misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This comprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective adversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our experimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate the efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP systems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances the subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks. This study highlights the critical role of context in adversarial attacks and lays the groundwork for creating more robust NLP systems capable of withstanding sophisticated adversarial strategies.</description>

      <title>What is the Cost of Differential Privacy for Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Generation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models. (2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN - affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees. In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained use cases.</description>

      <title>DAVSP: Safety Alignment for Large Vision-Language Models via Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress across various applications but remain vulnerable to malicious queries that exploit the visual modality. Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP), which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its overall effectiveness. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/DAVSP.</description>

      <title>ContextBuddy: AI-Enhanced Contextual Insights for Security Alert Investigation (Applied to Intrusion Detection)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Security Operations Centres (SOCs) integrate diverse tools, such as SIEM, IDS, and XDR systems, offering rich contextual data, including alert enrichments, flow features, and similar case histories. Yet, analysts must still manually determine which of these contextual cues are most relevant when validating specific alerts. We introduce ContextBuddy, an AI assistant that learns from analysts' prior investigations to help them identify the most relevant context for new alerts. Rather than providing enrichments, ContextBuddy models how analysts have previously selected context and suggests tailored cues based on the characteristics of each alert. We formulate context selection as a sequential decision-making problem and apply imitation learning (IL) to capture analysts' strategies, evaluating multiple IL approaches. Through staged evaluation, we validate ContextBuddy using two intrusion detection datasets (HIKARI-2021, UNSW-NB15). In simulation-based experiments, ContextBuddy helped simulated reinforcement learning analysts improve classification accuracy (p &lt; 0.001) (increasing F1 by 2.5% for HIKARI and 9% for UNSW), reducing false negatives (1.5% for HIKARI and 10% for UNSW), and keeping false positives below 1%. Decision confidence among agents also improved by 2-3% (p &lt; 0.001). In a within-subject user study (N=13; power = 0.8), non-experts using ContextBuddy improved classification accuracy by 21.1% (p = 0.008) and reduced alert validation time by 24% (p = 0.01). These results demonstrate that by learning context-selection patterns from analysts, ContextBuddy can yield notable improvements in investigation effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Epass: Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Asynchronous Payment on Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) is a rapidly proliferating e-commerce model, offering consumers to get the product immediately and defer payments. Meanwhile, emerging blockchain technologies endow BNPL platforms with digital currency transactions, allowing BNPL platforms to integrate with digital wallets. However, the transparency of transactions causes critical privacy concerns because malicious participants may derive consumers' financial statuses from on-chain asynchronous payments. Furthermore, the newly created transactions for deferred payments introduce additional time overheads, which weaken the scalability of BNPL services. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving blockchain-based asynchronous payment scheme (Epass), which has promising scalability while protecting the privacy of on-chain consumer transactions. Specifically, Epass leverages locally verifiable signatures to guarantee the privacy of consumer transactions against malicious acts. Then, a privacy-preserving asynchronous payment scheme can be further constructed by leveraging time-release encryption to control trapdoors of redactable blockchain, reducing time overheads by modifying transactions for deferred payment. We give formal definitions and security models, generic structures, and formal proofs for Epass. Extensive comparisons and experimental analysis show that \textsf{Epass} achieves KB-level communication costs, and reduces time overhead by more than four times in comparisons with locally verifiable signatures and Go-Ethereum private test networks.</description>

      <title>Securing Open RAN: A Survey of Cryptographic Challenges and Emerging Solutions for 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) introduces modularity and flexibility into 5G deployments but also surfaces novel security challenges across disaggregated interfaces. This literature review synthesizes recent research across thirteen academic and industry sources, examining vulnerabilities such as cipher bidding-down attacks, partial encryption exposure on control/user planes, and performance trade-offs in securing O-RAN interfaces like E2 and O1. The paper surveys key cryptographic tools -- SNOW-V, AES-256, and ZUC-256 -- evaluating their throughput, side-channel resilience, and adaptability to heterogeneous slices (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC). Emphasis is placed on emerging testbeds and AI-driven controllers that facilitate dynamic orchestration, anomaly detection, and secure configuration. We conclude by outlining future research directions, including hardware offloading, cross-layer cipher adaptation, and alignment with 3GPP TS 33.501 and O-RAN Alliance security mandates, all of which point toward the need for integrated, zero-trust architectures in 6G.</description>

      <title>LLMs Cannot Reliably Judge (Yet?): A Comprehensive Assessment on the Robustness of LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable intelligence across various tasks, which has inspired the development and widespread adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge systems for automated model testing, such as red teaming and benchmarking. However, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that can manipulate evaluation outcomes, raising concerns about their robustness and, consequently, their trustworthiness. Existing evaluation methods adopted by LLM-based judges are often piecemeal and lack a unified framework for comprehensive assessment. Furthermore, prompt template and model selections for improving judge robustness have been rarely explored, and their performance in real-world settings remains largely unverified. To address these gaps, we introduce RobustJudge, a fully automated and scalable framework designed to systematically evaluate the robustness of LLM-as-a-Judge systems. RobustJudge investigates the impact of attack methods and defense strategies (RQ1), explores the influence of prompt template and model selection (RQ2), and assesses the robustness of real-world LLM-as-a-Judge applications (RQ3).Our main findings are: (1) LLM-as-a-Judge systems are still vulnerable to a range of adversarial attacks, including Combined Attack and PAIR, while defense mechanisms such as Re-tokenization and LLM-based Detectors offer improved protection; (2) Robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of prompt template and judge models. Our proposed prompt template optimization method can improve robustness, and JudgeLM-13B demonstrates strong performance as a robust open-source judge; (3) Applying RobustJudge to Alibaba's PAI platform reveals previously unreported vulnerabilities. The source code of RobustJudge is provided at https://github.com/S3IC-Lab/RobustJudge.</description>

      <title>Efficient Modular Multiplier over GF (2^m) for ECPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has emerged as the dominant public-key protocol, with NIST standardizing parameters for binary field GF(2^m) ECC systems. This work presents a hardware implementation of a Hybrid Multiplication technique for modular multiplication over binary field GF(2m), targeting NIST B-163, 233, 283, and 571 parameters. The design optimizes the combination of conventional multiplication (CM) and Karatsuba multiplication (KM) to enhance elliptic curve point multiplication (ECPM). The key innovation uses CM for smaller operands (up to 41 bits for m=163) and KM for larger ones, reducing computational complexity and enhancing efficiency. The design is evaluated in three areas: Resource Utilization For m=163, the hybrid design uses 6,812 LUTs, a 39.82% reduction compared to conventional methods. For m=233, LUT usage reduces by 45.53% and 70.70% compared to overlap-free and bit-parallel implementations. Delay Performance For m=163, achieves 13.31ns delay, improving by 37.60% over bit-parallel implementations. For m=233, maintains 13.39ns delay. Area-Delay Product For m=163, achieves ADP of 90,860, outperforming bit-parallel (75,337) and digit-serial (43,179) implementations. For m=233, demonstrates 16.86% improvement over overlap-free and 96.10% over bit-parallel designs. Results show the hybrid technique significantly improves speed, hardware efficiency, and resource utilization for ECC cryptographic systems.</description>

      <title>The Secure Overview and Analysis OF 3GPP MAC CE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To more effectively control and allocate network resources, MAC CE has been introduced into the network protocol, which is a type of control signaling located in the MAC layer. Since MAC CE lacks encryption and integrity protection mechanisms provided by PDCP, the control signaling carried by MAC CE is vulnerable to interception or tampering by attackers during resource scheduling and allocation. Currently, the 3GPP has analyzed the security risks of Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM), where handover signaling sent to the UE via MAC CE by the network can lead to privacy leaks and network attacks. However, in addition to LTM, there may be other potential security vulnerabilities in other protocol procedures. Therefore, this paper explores the security threats to MAC CE and the corresponding protection mechanisms. The research is expected to support the 3GPP's study of MAC CE and be integrated with the security research of lower-layer protocols, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of the entire communication system.</description>

      <title>Beyond Personalization: Federated Recommendation with Calibration via Low-rank Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated recommendation (FR) is a promising paradigm to protect user privacy in recommender systems. Distinct from general federated scenarios, FR inherently needs to preserve client-specific parameters, i.e., user embeddings, for privacy and personalization. However, we empirically find that globally aggregated item embeddings can induce skew in user embeddings, resulting in suboptimal performance. To this end, we theoretically analyze the user embedding skew issue and propose Personalized Federated recommendation with Calibration via Low-Rank decomposition (PFedCLR). Specifically, PFedCLR introduces an integrated dual-function mechanism, implemented with a buffer matrix, to jointly calibrate local user embedding and personalize global item embeddings. To ensure efficiency, we employ a low-rank decomposition of the buffer matrix to reduce the model overhead. Furthermore, for privacy, we train and upload the local model before personalization, preventing the server from accessing sensitive information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PFedCLR effectively mitigates user embedding skew and achieves a desirable trade-off among performance, efficiency, and privacy, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computing continuum introduces new challenges for access control due to its dynamic, distributed, and heterogeneous nature. In this paper, we propose a Zero-Trust (ZT) access control solution that leverages decentralized identification and authentication mechanisms based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Additionally, we employ Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) to define policies that capture the evolving trust relationships inherent in the continuum. Through a proof-of-concept implementation, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our solution, highlighting its potential to enhance security and trust in decentralized environments.</description>

      <title>TooBadRL: Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of sequential decision-making domains, including robotics, healthcare, smart grids, and finance. Recent research demonstrates that attackers can efficiently exploit system vulnerabilities during the training phase to execute backdoor attacks, producing malicious actions when specific trigger patterns are present in the state observations. However, most existing backdoor attacks rely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking the potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we introduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor Attacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor triggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude. Specifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing mechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a cooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most influential state variable for the injection dimension. Furthermore, we propose a gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude under environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms and nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack success rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance. These results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of principled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks. The source code of TooBadRL can be found at https://github.com/S3IC-Lab/TooBadRL.</description>

Abstract: We extend Rabin's cryptosystem to general number fields. We show that decryption of a random plaintext is as hard as the integer factorisation problem, provided the modulus in our scheme has been chosen carefully. We investigate the performance of our new cryptosystem in comparison with the classical Rabin scheme and a more recent version over the Gaussian integers.</description>

      <title>The Everyday Security of Living with Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When `cyber' is used as a prefix, attention is typically drawn to the technological and spectacular aspects of war and conflict -- and, by extension, security. We offer a different approach to engaging with and understanding security in such contexts, by foregrounding the everyday -- mundane -- experiences of security within communities living with and fleeing from war. We do so through three vignettes from our field research in Colombia, Lebanon and Sweden, respectively, and by highlighting the significance of ethnography for security research with communities living in regions afflicted by war. We conclude by setting out a call to action for security researchers and practitioners to consider such lived experiences in the design of security technology that aims to cater to the needs of communities in `global conflict and disaster regions'.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantification of Spurious Correlations in Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end deep learning exhibits unmatched performance for detecting malware, but such an achievement is reached by exploiting spurious correlations -- features with high relevance at inference time, but known to be useless through domain knowledge. While previous work highlighted that deep networks mainly focus on metadata, none investigated the phenomenon further, without quantifying their impact on the decision. In this work, we deepen our understanding of how spurious correlation affects deep learning for malware detection by highlighting how much models rely on empty spaces left by the compiler, which diminishes the relevance of the compiled code. Through our seminal analysis on a small-scale balanced dataset, we introduce a ranking of two end-to-end models to better understand which is more suitable to be put in production.</description>

      <title>On the Virtues of Information Security in the UK Climate Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an ethnographic study with members of the climate movement in the United Kingdom (UK). We conducted participant observation and interviews at protests and in various activist settings. Reporting on the findings as they relate to information security, we show that members of the UK climate movement wrestled with (i) a fundamental tension between openness and secrecy; (ii) tensions between autonomy and collective interdependence in information-security decision-making; (iii) conflicting activist ideals that shape security discourses; and (iv) pressures from different social gazes -- from each other, from people outside the movement and from their adversaries. Overall, our findings shed light on the social complexities of information-security research in activist settings and provoke methodological questions about programmes that aim to design for activists.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer-Based Device Fingerprinting for Wireless Security: From Theory to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of the devices from which a message is received is part of security mechanisms to ensure authentication in wireless communications. Conventional authentication approaches are cryptography-based, which, however, are usually computationally expensive and not adequate in the Internet of Things (IoT), where devices tend to be low-cost and with limited resources. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of physical layer-based device fingerprinting, which is an emerging device authentication for wireless security. In particular, this article focuses on hardware impairment-based identity authentication and channel features-based authentication. They are passive techniques that are readily applicable to legacy IoT devices. Their intrinsic hardware and channel features, algorithm design methodologies, application scenarios, and key research questions are extensively reviewed here. The remaining research challenges are discussed, and future work is suggested that can further enhance the physical layer-based device fingerprinting.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher. In this paper, we present a new implementation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We further introduce the notion of an "oracle function" as a general predictive tool for deciding whether the evaluation of a new variable is necessary to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function. Finally, we apply the multistep solving strategy to the cryptanalysis of the low-latency block cipher Aradi, recently introduced by the NSA. We present the first full round algebraic attack, raising concerns about the cipher's actual security with respect to its key length.</description>

      <title>LLMail-Inject: A Dataset from a Realistic Adaptive Prompt Injection Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect Prompt Injection attacks exploit the inherent limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) to distinguish between instructions and data in their inputs. Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against adaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have wide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based applications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a public challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants adaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to trigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge spanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval configurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions from 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of submissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new insights into the instruction-data separation problem. We hope this will serve as a foundation for future research towards practical structural solutions to prompt injection.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable N-gram Perplexity Threat Model for Large Language Model Jailbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16222v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this, we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and, for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.</description>

      <title>SoK: Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical topic in machine learning, aiming to eliminate the influence of specific training data or knowledge without retraining the model from scratch. A variety of techniques have been proposed, including Gradient Ascent, model editing, and re-steering hidden representations. While existing surveys often organize these methods by their technical characteristics, such classifications tend to overlook a more fundamental dimension: the underlying intention of unlearning--whether it seeks to truly remove internal knowledge or merely suppress its behavioral effects. In this SoK paper, we propose a new taxonomy based on this intention-oriented perspective. Building on this taxonomy, we make three key contributions. First, we revisit recent findings suggesting that many removal methods may functionally behave like suppression, and explore whether true removal is necessary or achievable. Second, we survey existing evaluation strategies, identify limitations in current metrics and benchmarks, and suggest directions for developing more reliable and intention-aligned evaluations. Third, we highlight practical challenges--such as scalability and support for sequential unlearning--that currently hinder the broader deployment of unlearning methods. In summary, this work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and advancing unlearning in generative AI, aiming to support future research and guide policy decisions around data removal and privacy.</description>

      <title>SAGE: Exploring the Boundaries of Unsafe Concept Domain with Semantic-Augment Erasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it, trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs. The code and weights will be open-sourced at https://github.com/KevinLight831/SAGE.</description>

      <title>Learning Obfuscations Of LLM Embedding Sequences: Stained Glass Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned, stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM performance benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Covert Entanglement Generation over Bosonic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore covert entanglement generation over the lossy thermal-noise bosonic channel, which is a quantum-mechanical model of many practical settings, including optical, microwave, and radio-frequency (RF) channels. Covert communication ensures that an adversary is unable to detect the presence of transmissions, which are concealed in channel noise. We show that a $\textit{square root law}$ (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method. We additionally analyze the performance of covert entanglement generation using single- and dual-rail photonic qubits, which may be more practical for physical implementation.</description>

      <title>Effective Red-Teaming of Policy-Adherent Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies, appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger, research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial attacks</description>

      <title>BF-Max: an Efficient Bit Flipping Decoder with Predictable Decoding Failure Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bit-Flipping (BF) decoder, thanks to its very low computational complexity, is widely employed in post-quantum cryptographic schemes based on Moderate Density Parity Check codes in which, ultimately, decryption boils down to syndrome decoding. In such a setting, for security concerns, one must guarantee that the Decoding Failure Rate (DFR) is negligible. Such a condition, however, is very difficult to guarantee, because simulations are of little help and the decoder performance is difficult to model theoretically. In this paper, we introduce a new version of the BF decoder, that we call BF-Max, characterized by the fact that in each iteration only one bit (the least reliable) is flipped. When the number of iterations is equal to the number of errors to be corrected, we are able to develop a theoretical characterization of the DFR that tightly matches with numerical simulations. We also show how BF-Max can be implemented efficiently, achieving low complexity and making it inherently constant time. With our modeling, we are able to accurately predict values of DFR that are remarkably lower than those estimated by applying other approaches.</description>

      <title>Mapping NVD Records to Their VFCs: How Hard is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping National Vulnerability Database (NVD) records to vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) is crucial for vulnerability analysis but challenging due to sparse explicit links in NVD references.This study explores this mapping's feasibility through an empirical approach. Manual analysis of NVD references showed Git references enable over 86% success, while non-Git references achieve under 14%. Using these findings, we built an automated pipeline extracting 31,942 VFCs from 20,360 NVD records (8.7% of 235,341) with 87% precision, mainly from Git references. To fill gaps, we mined six external security databases, yielding 29,254 VFCs for 18,985 records (8.1%) at 88.4% precision, and GitHub repositories, adding 3,686 VFCs for 2,795 records (1.2%) at 73% precision. Combining these, we mapped 26,710 unique records (11.3% coverage) from 7,634 projects, with overlap between NVD and external databases, plus unique GitHub contributions. Despite success with Git references, 88.7% of records remain unmapped, highlighting the difficulty without Git links. This study offers insights for enhancing vulnerability datasets and guiding future automated security research.</description>

      <title>Devil's Hand: Data Poisoning Attacks to Locally Private Graph Learning Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in graph representation learning and have been applied to various domains. However, many real-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness highlights the need for more robust defenses.</description>

      <title>On the Impossibility of a Perfect Hypervisor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a fundamental impossibility result for a `perfect hypervisor', one that (1) preserves every observable behavior of any program exactly as on bare metal and (2) adds zero timing or resource overhead.
  Within this model we prove two theorems. (1) Indetectability Theorem. If such a hypervisor existed, no guest-level program, measurement, or timing test could distinguish it from native execution; all traces, outputs, and timings would be identical.
  (2) Impossibility Theorem. Despite that theoretical indetectability, a perfect hypervisor cannot exist on any machine with finite computational resources.
  These results are architecture-agnostic and extend beyond hypervisors to any virtualization layer emulators, sandboxes, containers, or runtime-instrumentation frameworks. Together they provide a formal foundation for future work on the principles and limits of virtualization.</description>

      <title>FastLloyd: Federated, Accurate, Secure, and Tunable $k$-Means Clustering with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of privacy-preserving $k$-means clustering in the horizontally federated setting. Existing federated approaches using secure computation suffer from substantial overheads and do not offer output privacy. At the same time, differentially private (DP) $k$-means algorithms either assume a trusted central curator or significantly degrade utility by adding noise in the local DP model. Naively combining the secure and central DP solutions results in a protocol with impractical overhead. Instead, our work provides enhancements to both the DP and secure computation components, resulting in a design that is faster, more private, and more accurate than previous work. By utilizing the computational DP model, we design a lightweight, secure aggregation-based approach that achieves five orders of magnitude speed-up over state-of-the-art related work. Furthermore, we not only maintain the utility of the state-of-the-art in the central model of DP, but we improve the utility further by designing a new DP clustering mechanism.</description>

      <title>ProxyGPT: Enabling User Anonymity in LLM Chatbots via (Un)Trustworthy Volunteer Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Popular large language model (LLM) chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude require users to create an account with an email or a phone number before allowing full access to their services. This practice ties users' personally identifiable information (PII) to their sensitive conversational data, thus posing significant privacy risks. Unfortunately, existing private LLM solutions based on cryptography or trusted execution environments (TEEs) remain unpopular due to their prohibitive computational expense and platform restrictions. To enable practical user anonymity in LLM chatbots, we propose ProxyGPT, a privacy-enhancing system that leverages browser interaction proxies to submit user queries on their behalf. Unlike traditional proxy systems, ProxyGPT operates at the "user" layer by proxying user interactions with the browser in identity-required environments, thus easily supporting a wide range of chatbot services. We prevent malicious proxies by performing regular integrity audits using modern web proof protocols for TLS data provenance. We further utilize state-of-the-art LLM prompt guards on the proxy's side to mitigate unwanted user requests. Additionally, we incorporate a give-and-take economy based on Chaum's blind-signature e-cash to incentivize ProxyGPT users to proxy for others. Our system evaluation and user study demonstrate the practicality of our approach, as each chat request only takes a few additional seconds on average to fully complete. To the best of our knowledge, ProxyGPT is the first comprehensive proxy-based solution for privacy-preserving AI chatbots.</description>

      <title>Code Vulnerability Repair with Large Language Model using Context-Aware Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant challenges in detecting and repairing vulnerable code, particularly when dealing with vulnerabilities involving multiple aspects, such as variables, code flows, and code structures. In this study, we utilize GitHub Copilot as the LLM and focus on buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Our experiments reveal a notable gap in Copilot's abilities when dealing with buffer overflow vulnerabilities, with a 76% vulnerability detection rate but only a 15% vulnerability repair rate. To address this issue, we propose context-aware prompt tuning techniques designed to enhance LLM performance in repairing buffer overflow. By injecting a sequence of domain knowledge about the vulnerability, including various security and code contexts, we demonstrate that Copilot's successful repair rate increases to 63%, representing more than four times the improvement compared to repairs without domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>PEFTGuard: Detecting Backdoor Attacks Against Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning is an essential process to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specific domains, with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) gaining popularity due to its capacity to reduce computational demands through the integration of low-rank adapters. These lightweight adapters, such as LoRA, can be shared and utilized on open-source platforms. However, adversaries could exploit this mechanism to inject backdoors into these adapters, resulting in malicious behaviors like incorrect or harmful outputs, which pose serious security risks to the community. Unfortunately, few current efforts concentrate on analyzing the backdoor patterns or detecting the backdoors in the adapters. To fill this gap, we first construct and release PADBench, a comprehensive benchmark that contains 13,300 benign and backdoored adapters fine-tuned with various datasets, attack strategies, PEFT methods, and LLMs. Moreover, we propose PEFTGuard, the first backdoor detection framework against PEFT-based adapters. Extensive evaluation upon PADBench shows that PEFTGuard outperforms existing detection methods, achieving nearly perfect detection accuracy (100%) in most cases. Notably, PEFTGuard exhibits zero-shot transferability on three aspects, including different attacks, PEFT methods, and adapter ranks. In addition, we consider various adaptive attacks to demonstrate the high robustness of PEFTGuard. We further explore several possible backdoor mitigation defenses, finding fine-mixing to be the most effective method. We envision that our benchmark and method can shed light on future LLM backdoor detection research.</description>

      <title>MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs. Code is available at https://github.com/kaijiezhu11/MELON.</description>

Abstract: The capabilities of artificial intelligence systems have been advancing to a great extent, but these systems still struggle with failure modes, vulnerabilities, and biases. In this paper, we study the current state of the field, and present promising insights and perspectives regarding concerns that challenge the trustworthiness of AI models. In particular, this paper investigates the issues regarding three thrusts: safety, privacy, and bias, which hurt models' trustworthiness. For safety, we discuss safety alignment in the context of large language models, preventing them from generating toxic or harmful content. For bias, we focus on spurious biases that can mislead a network. Lastly, for privacy, we cover membership inference attacks in deep neural networks. The discussions addressed in this paper reflect our own experiments and observations.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Measurement: A Survey of How the Blockchain Trilemma Can Be Analyzed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet non-functional requirements, practitioners must identify Pareto-optimal configurations of the degree of decentralization, scalability, and security of blockchain systems. Maximizing all of these subconcepts is, however, impossible due to the trade-offs highlighted by the blockchain trilemma. We reviewed analysis approaches to identify constructs and their operationalization through metrics for analyzing the blockchain trilemma subconcepts and to assess the applicability of the operationalized constructs to various blockchain systems. By clarifying these constructs and metrics, this work offers a theoretical foundation for more sophisticated investigations into how the blockchain trilemma manifests in blockchain systems, helping practitioners identify Pareto-optimal configurations.</description>

      <title>First-Spammed, First-Served: MEV Extraction on Fast-Finality Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research analyzes the economics of spam-based arbitrage strategies on fast-finality blockchains. We begin by theoretically demonstrating that, splitting a profitable MEV opportunity into multiple small transactions is the optimal strategy for CEX-DEX arbitrageurs. We then empirically validate these findings on major Ethereum rollups. To uncover the structure of reverted transactions, we construct execution graphs from transaction traces and systematically search them to identify DEX or router interactions and targeted liquidity pools. This analysis reveals that 80\% of reverted transactions are swaps with approximately 50\% targeting USDC-WETH pools on Uniswap v3/v4. These patterns intensified following the March 2024 Dencun upgrade, which lowered L2 gas costs and made spam-based arbitrage economically viable. Counterintuitively, we find that these reverted MEV transactions rarely engage with Priority Fee Auctions (PFAs), preferring to submit duplicate transactions rather than bid for inclusion. Moreover, reverted transactions cluster at the very top of blocks on fast rollups like Arbitrum and ZKsync, indicating an intense latency race and revealing the fragility of fee-based ordering under sub-second block times.</description>

      <title>Mono: Is Your "Clean" Vulnerability Dataset Really Solvable? Exposing and Trapping Undecidable Patches and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantity and quality of vulnerability datasets are essential for developing deep learning solutions to vulnerability-related tasks. Due to the limited availability of vulnerabilities, a common approach to building such datasets is analyzing security patches in source code. However, existing security patches often suffer from inaccurate labels, insufficient contextual information, and undecidable patches that fail to clearly represent the root causes of vulnerabilities or their fixes. These issues introduce noise into the dataset, which can mislead detection models and undermine their effectiveness. To address these issues, we present mono, a novel LLM-powered framework that simulates human experts' reasoning process to construct reliable vulnerability datasets. mono introduces three key components to improve security patch datasets: (i) semantic-aware patch classification for precise vulnerability labeling, (ii) iterative contextual analysis for comprehensive code understanding, and (iii) systematic root cause analysis to identify and filter undecidable patches. Our comprehensive evaluation on the MegaVul benchmark demonstrates that mono can correct 31.0% of labeling errors, recover 89% of inter-procedural vulnerabilities, and reveals that 16.7% of CVEs contain undecidable patches. Furthermore, mono's enriched context representation improves existing models' vulnerability detection accuracy by 15%. We open source the framework mono and the dataset MonoLens in https://github.com/vul337/mono.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Federated $k$-Means Clustering with Server-Side Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of data analysis that is particularly suited to identifying coherent subgroups or substructures in unlabeled data, as are generated continuously in large amounts these days. However, in many cases traditional clustering methods are not applicable, because data are increasingly being produced and stored in a distributed way, e.g. on edge devices, and privacy concerns prevent it from being transferred to a central server. To address this challenge, we present FedDP-KMeans, a new algorithm for $k$-means clustering that is fully-federated as well as differentially private. Our approach leverages (potentially small and out-of-distribution) server-side data to overcome the primary challenge of differentially private clustering methods: the need for a good initialization. Combining our initialization with a simple federated DP-Lloyds algorithm we obtain an algorithm that achieves excellent results on synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks. We also provide a theoretical analysis of our method that provides bounds on the convergence speed and cluster identification success.</description>

      <title>Auditing Black-Box LLM APIs with a Rank-Based Uniformity Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs), users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under constrained query budgets.</description>

      <title>Your Agent Can Defend Itself against Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model (LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance, ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor risks.</description>

      <title>Share Secrets for Privacy: Confidential Forecasting with Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising area for time series forecasting in many applications, such as healthcare and manufacturing. Critical challenges to address include data privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and inference. Additionally, such forecasting models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address these challenges and propose ``Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL'' (STV), a novel framework with the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically-partitioned data; ii) decentralised forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party computation; and iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and inverse operations for exact parameter optimization, giving strong convergence with minimal tuning complexity. We evaluate on six representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Results demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of centralized approaches. Our exact optimization outperforms centralized methods, including state-of-the-art diffusion models and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also evaluate scalability by examining the communication costs of exact and iterative optimization to navigate the choice between the two. STV's code and supplementary material is available online: https://github.com/adis98/STV.</description>

Abstract: Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) sometimes falsely refuse pseudo-harmful prompts, like "how to kill a mosquito," which are actually harmless. Frequent false refusals not only frustrate users but also provoke a public backlash against the very values alignment seeks to protect. In this paper, we propose the first method to auto-generate diverse, content-controlled, and model-dependent pseudo-harmful prompts. Using this method, we construct an evaluation dataset called PHTest, which is ten times larger than existing datasets, covers more false refusal patterns, and separately labels controversial prompts. We evaluate 20 LLMs on PHTest, uncovering new insights due to its scale and labeling. Our findings reveal a trade-off between minimizing false refusals and improving safety against jailbreak attacks. Moreover, we show that many jailbreak defenses significantly increase the false refusal rates, thereby undermining usability. Our method and dataset can help developers evaluate and fine-tune safer and more usable LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/umd-huang-lab/FalseRefusal</description>

      <title>Multimodal Pragmatic Jailbreak on Text-to-image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable advancements in terms of image quality and fidelity to textual prompts. Concurrently, the safety of such generative models has become an area of growing concern. This work introduces a novel type of jailbreak, which triggers T2I models to generate the image with visual text, where the image and the text, although considered to be safe in isolation, combine to form unsafe content. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we propose a dataset to evaluate the current diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models under such jailbreak. We benchmark nine representative T2I models, including two closed-source commercial models. Experimental results reveal a concerning tendency to produce unsafe content: all tested models suffer from such type of jailbreak, with rates of unsafe generation ranging from around 10\% to 70\% where DALLE 3 demonstrates almost the highest unsafety. In real-world scenarios, various filters such as keyword blocklists, customized prompt filters, and NSFW image filters, are commonly employed to mitigate these risks. We evaluate the effectiveness of such filters against our jailbreak and found that, while these filters may be effective for single modality detection, they fail to work against our jailbreak. We also investigate the underlying reason for such jailbreaks, from the perspective of text rendering capability and training data. Our work provides a foundation for further development towards more secure and reliable T2I models. Project page at https://multimodalpragmatic.github.io/.</description>

      <title>WaKA: Data Attribution using K-Nearest Neighbors and Membership Privacy Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce WaKA (Wasserstein K-nearest-neighbors Attribution), a novel attribution method that leverages principles from the LiRA (Likelihood Ratio Attack) framework and k-nearest neighbors classifiers (k-NN). WaKA efficiently measures the contribution of individual data points to the model's loss distribution, analyzing every possible k-NN that can be constructed using the training set, without requiring to sample subsets of the training set. WaKA is versatile and can be used a posteriori as a membership inference attack (MIA) to assess privacy risks or a priori for privacy influence measurement and data valuation. Thus, WaKA can be seen as bridging the gap between data attribution and membership inference attack (MIA) by providing a unified framework to distinguish between a data point's value and its privacy risk. For instance, we have shown that self-attribution values are more strongly correlated with the attack success rate than the contribution of a point to the model generalization. WaKA's different usage were also evaluated across diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating performance very close to LiRA when used as an MIA on k-NN classifiers, but with greater computational efficiency. Additionally, WaKA shows greater robustness than Shapley Values for data minimization tasks (removal or addition) on imbalanced datasets.</description>

      <title>Model Attribution and Detection of Synthetic Speech via Vocoder Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, so do the potential threats of misusing synthetic speech signals. This work tackles three tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting corresponding to the task of identifying whether synthetic speech signals originate from a specific vocoder (which requires only target vocoder data), (2) model attribution in a closed-world setting that corresponds to selecting the specific model that generated a sample from a given set of models, and (3) distinguishing synthetic from real speech. We show that standardized average residuals between audio signals and their low-pass or EnCodec filtered versions serve as powerful vocoder fingerprints that can be leveraged for all tasks achieving an average AUROC of over 99% on LJSpeech and JSUT in most settings. The accompanying robustness study shows that it is also resilient to noise levels up to a certain degree.</description>

      <title>PatchPilot: A Cost-Efficient Software Engineering Agent with Early Attempts on Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research builds various patching agents that combine large language models (LLMs) with non-ML tools and achieve promising results on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) software patching benchmark, SWE-bench. Based on how to determine the patching workflows, existing patching agents can be categorized as agent-based planning methods, which rely on LLMs for planning, and rule-based planning methods, which follow a pre-defined workflow. At a high level, agent-based planning methods achieve high patching performance but with a high cost and limited stability. Rule-based planning methods, on the other hand, are more stable and efficient but have key workflow limitations that compromise their patching performance. In this paper, we propose PatchPilot, an agentic patcher that strikes a balance between patching efficacy, stability, and cost-efficiency. PatchPilot proposes a novel rule-based planning workflow with five components: reproduction, localization, generation, validation, and refinement (where refinement is unique to PatchPilot). We introduce novel and customized designs to each component to optimize their effectiveness and efficiency. Through extensive experiments on the SWE-bench benchmarks, PatchPilot shows a superior performance than existing open-source methods while maintaining low cost (less than 1$ per instance) and ensuring higher stability. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/ucsb-mlsec/PatchPilot.</description>

      <title>The Popularity Hypothesis in Software Security: A Large-Scale Replication with PHP Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a long-standing hypothesis that a software's popularity is related to its security or insecurity in both research and popular discourse. There are also a few empirical studies that have examined the hypothesis, either explicitly or implicitly. The present work continues with and contributes to this research with a replication-motivated large-scale analysis of software written in the PHP programming language. The dataset examined contains nearly four hundred thousand open source software packages written in PHP. According to the results based on reported security vulnerabilities, the hypothesis does holds; packages having been affected by vulnerabilities over their release histories are generally more popular than packages without having been affected by a single vulnerability. With this replication results, the paper contributes to the efforts to strengthen the empirical knowledge base in cyber and software security.</description>

      <title>FC-Attack: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Auto-Generated Flowcharts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted in some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their vulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced to generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most MLLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, MLLMs can be induced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute the jailbreak attack on MLLMs. Our evaluations on Advbench show that FC-Attack attains an attack success rate of up to 96% via images and up to 78% via videos across multiple MLLMs. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. We also find that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Guided Spiking Neural Networks for Event-Based Human Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the promising interplay between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras for privacy-preserving human action recognition (HAR). The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.</description>

      <title>One Pic is All it Takes: Poisoning Visual Document Retrieval Augmented Generation with a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal retrieval augmented generation (M-RAG) is instrumental for inhibiting hallucinations in large multi-modal models (LMMs) through the use of a factual knowledge base (KB). However, M-RAG introduces new attack vectors for adversaries that aim to disrupt the system by injecting malicious entries into the KB. In this paper, we present the first poisoning attack against M-RAG targeting visual document retrieval applications where the KB contains images of document pages. We propose two attacks, each of which require injecting only a single adversarial image into the KB. Firstly, we propose a universal attack that, for any potential user query, influences the response to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) in the M-RAG system. Secondly, we present a targeted attack against one or a group of user queries, with the goal of spreading targeted misinformation. For both attacks, we use a multi-objective gradient-based adversarial approach to craft the injected image while optimizing for both retrieval and generation. We evaluate our attacks against several visual document retrieval datasets, a diverse set of state-of-the-art retrievers (embedding models) and generators (LMMs), demonstrating the attack effectiveness in both the universal and targeted settings. We additionally present results including commonly used defenses, various attack hyper-parameter settings, ablations, and attack transferability.</description>

      <title>Generate-then-Verify: Reconstructing Data from Limited Published Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing tabular data from aggregate statistics, in which the attacker aims to identify interesting claims about the sensitive data that can be verified with 100% certainty given the aggregates. Successful attempts in prior work have conducted studies in settings where the set of published statistics is rich enough that entire datasets can be reconstructed with certainty. In our work, we instead focus on the regime where many possible datasets match the published statistics, making it impossible to reconstruct the entire private dataset perfectly (i.e., when approaches in prior work fail). We propose the problem of partial data reconstruction, in which the goal of the adversary is to instead output a $\textit{subset}$ of rows and/or columns that are $\textit{guaranteed to be correct}$. We introduce a novel integer programming approach that first $\textbf{generates}$ a set of claims and then $\textbf{verifies}$ whether each claim holds for all possible datasets consistent with the published aggregates. We evaluate our approach on the housing-level microdata from the U.S. Decennial Census release, demonstrating that privacy violations can still persist even when information published about such data is relatively sparse.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Multi-Task Federated Foundation Models for Next-Generation Extended Reality Systems: Towards Privacy-Preserving Distributed Intelligence in AR/VR/MR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction. In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models (FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3) Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability, and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the next generation of XR systems.</description>

      <title>Certified Unlearning for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of machine unlearning, where the goal is to remove the influence of specific training data from a model upon request, motivated by privacy concerns and regulatory requirements such as the "right to be forgotten." Unfortunately, existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions or lack formal guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel method for certified machine unlearning, leveraging the connection between unlearning and privacy amplification by stochastic post-processing. Our method uses noisy fine-tuning on the retain data, i.e., data that does not need to be removed, to ensure provable unlearning guarantees. This approach requires no assumptions about the underlying loss function, making it broadly applicable across diverse settings. We analyze the theoretical trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy and demonstrate empirically that our method not only achieves formal unlearning guarantees but also performs effectively in practice, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/stair-lab/certified-unlearning-neural-networks-icml-2025</description>

      <title>Design Patterns for Securing LLM Agents against Prompt Injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.</description>
