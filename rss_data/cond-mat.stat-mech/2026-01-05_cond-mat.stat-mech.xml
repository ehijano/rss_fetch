      <title>Thermalization in a closed quantum system from randomized dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of statistical mechanics from quantum dynamics is a central problem in quantum many-body physics. Deriving observables aligned with the prediction of the canonical ensemble for a quantum system relies on the presence of a bath provided either as an external environment or as a larger part of a closed system. We demonstrate that thermal (canonical) observables for a whole closed quantum system of finite size can arise in the absence of a bath. These thermal observables stem from classical averaging over randomized unitary evolutions for a few-body system. The temperature in the canonical ensemble appears as a global constraint on the total energy of the system, determined by the choice of the initial state. From averaging randomized evolutions, we derive spin-spin correlation functions for a finite spin chain and show that they exhibit a temperature-dependent finite correlation length, in agreement with the prediction of the canonical ensemble. This establishes a method for computing thermal observables in a closed, finite-size system from real-time propagation without a bath. An implementation of this thermalization approach on a quantum computer can be utilized for thermal state preparation.</description>

      <title>Bridging Commutant and Polynomial Methods for Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum model exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) if its Hilbert space decomposes into exponentially many dynamically disconnected subspaces, known as Krylov subspaces. A model may however have different HSFs depending on the method for identifying them. Here we establish a connection between two vastly distinct methods recently proposed for identifying HSF: the commutant algebra (CA) method and integer characteristic polynomial factorization (ICPF) method. For a Hamiltonian consisting of operators admitting rational number matrix representations, we prove a theorem that, if its center of commutant algebra have all eigenvalues being rational, the HSF from the ICPF method must be equal to or finer than that from the CA method. We show that this condition is satisfied by most known models exhibiting HSF, for which we demonstrate the validity of our theorem. We further discuss representative models for which ICPF and CA methods yield different HSFs. Our results may facilitate the exploration of a unified definition of HSF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method to compute the reweighted path ensemble by combining transition interface sampling simulations conditioned on different collective variables. The approach is based on the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) methodology applied to entire trajectories. Illustrating the technique with simple 2D potential models and a more complex host-guest system, we show that the statistics can significantly improve compared to a straightforward combination.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description>

      <title>Modelling the movements of organisms by stochastic theory in a comoving frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine you walk in a plane. You move by making a step of a certain length per time interval in a chosen direction. Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones.</description>

      <title>Nanocrystal Geometry Governs Phase Transformation Pathways in Palladium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathways and structural dynamics of phase transformations impact performance of materials in energy and information storage technologies. Palladium hydride ($\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $\alpha$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected by the confined geometry of a nanocrystal. However, how nanocrystal geometry influences phase transformation pathways is largely unknown. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize hydrogenation in Pd nanocrystals with two geometries -- a nanocube and a hexagonal nanoplate. Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\{100\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces. Theoretical simulations show that geometry determines the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways as the system is driven far from equilibrium during hydrogenation. These findings identify geometry as a fundamental parameter for directing phase transformation pathways, offering design principles for accessing atypical configurations and improving properties of intercalation-based devices.</description>

      <title>Topological physics in quantum critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology forms a cornerstone in modern condensed matter and statistical physics, offering a new framework to classify the phases and phase transitions beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, it is widely believed that topological properties are destroyed when the bulk energy gap closes, making it highly nontrivial to consider topology in gapless quantum critical systems. To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems. Additionally, we discuss further generalizations and future directions, including higher dimensions, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and realizations in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>Anderson localisation in spatially structured random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Anderson localisation on high-dimensional graphs with spatial structure induced by long-ranged but distance-dependent hopping. To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs. We also observe distinct critical behaviour in average and typical correlation functions, reflecting the different scaling properties of generalised inverse participation ratios.</description>

      <title>Nature is stingy: Universality of Scrooge ensembles in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators allow direct experimental access to the ensemble of pure states generated by measuring part of an isolated quantum many-body system. These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Effective Graph Resistance as Cumulative Heat Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective graph resistance is a fundamental structural metric in network science, widely used to quantify global connectivity, compare network architectures, and assess robustness in flow-based systems. Despite its importance, current formulations rely mainly on spectral or pseudo-inverse Laplacian representations, offering limited physical insight into how structural features shape this quantity or how it can be efficiently optimized. Here, we establish an exact and physically transparent relationship between effective graph resistance and the cumulative heat dissipation generated by Laplacian diffusion dynamics. We show that the total heat dissipated during relaxation to equilibrium precisely equals the effective graph resistance. This dynamical viewpoint uncovers a natural multi-scale decomposition of the Laplacian spectrum: early-time dissipation is governed by degree-based local structure, intermediate times isolate eigenvalues below the spectral mean, and long times are dominated by the algebraic connectivity. These multi-scale properties yield continuous and interpretable strategies for modifying network structure and constructing optimized ensembles, enabling improvements that are otherwise NP-hard to achieve via combinatorial methods. Our results unify structural and dynamical perspectives on network connectivity and provide new tools for analyzing, comparing, and optimizing complex networks across domains.</description>

Abstract: We study the ergodic properties of a unitary Floquet dynamics arising from the repeated application of a translationally-invariant Clifford Quantum Cellular Automata to an infinite system of qubits in d dimensions. One expects that if the QCA does not exhibit any periodicity, a generic initial state of qubits will thermalize, that is, approach the infinite-temperature state. We show that this is true for many classes of states, both pure and mixed. In particular, this is true for all initial states that are short-range entangled and close to the equilibrium state. We also point out a subtle distinction between weak and strong thermalization.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Accelerated Sampling of Pauli Strings for Nonstabilizerness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum magic, quantified by nonstabilizerness, measures departures from stabilizer structure and underlies potential quantum speedups. We introduce an efficient classical algorithm that exactly computes stabilizer R\'enyi entropies and stabilizer nullity for generic many-body wavefunctions of $N$ qubits. The method combines the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform with an exact partition of Pauli operators. It achieves an exponential speedup over direct approaches, reducing the average cost per sampled Pauli string from $O(2^N)$ to $O(N)$. Building on this framework, we further develop a Monte-Carlo estimator for stabilizer R\'enyi entropies together with a Clifford-based variance-reduction scheme that suppresses sampling fluctuations. We benchmark the accuracy and efficiency on ensembles of random magic states, and apply the method to random Clifford circuits with doped $T$ gates, comparing different doping architectures. Our approach applies to arbitrary quantum states and provides quantitative access to magic resources both encoded in highly entangled states and generated by long-time nonequilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Investigating dynamics and asymptotic trend to equilibrium in a reactive BGK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate numerically a recent BGK-type model for a multi-component mixture of monatomic gases, undergoing a reversible bimolecular chemical reaction. The model replaces each collisional term of the Boltzmann equation with a relaxation term, thereby describing separately the effects of the mechanical processes and the chemical reaction. Additionally, the model exhibits consistency properties. The correct entropy production is ensured when auxiliary temperatures in the chemical contributions share a common value. We assume isotropic distributions and perform numerical simulations for the macroscopic fields to appraise how the dynamics push the mixture toward thermalization and chemical equilibrium. We show that the hypothesis on the equalization of fictitious species temperatures is justifiable to ensure the monotonicity of the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional. Simulations show that, when initial temperatures are far from equilibrium, the relaxation towards equilibrium occurs at a later stage and the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional is not monotone during the initial transient.</description>

      <title>A BGK-type model for multi-component gas mixtures undergoing a bimolecular chemical reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new kinetic BGK-type model for a mixture of four monatomic gases, undergoing a bimolecular and reversible chemical reaction. The elastic and reactive interactions are described separately by distinct relaxation terms and the mechanical operator is the sum of binary BGK contributions, one for each pair of interacting species. In this way, our model separately incorporates the effects of mechanical processes and chemical reactions. Additionally, it retains the effects of inter-species interactions which are proper of the mixture. The dependence of Maxwellian attractors on the main macroscopic fields is explicitly expressed by assuming that the exchange rates for momentum and energy of mechanical and chemical operators coincide with the ones of the corresponding Boltzmann terms. Under suitable hypotheses, the relaxation of the distribution functions to equilibrium is shown through entropy dissipation. Some numerical simulations are included to investigate the trend to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional lattice random walks in a Gaussian random potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random walks evolving in continuous time on a one-dimensional lattice where each site $x$ hosts a quenched random potential $U_x$. The potentials on different sites are independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables. We analyze three distinct models that specify how the transition rates depend on $U_x$: the random-force-like model, random walks with randomized stepping times, and the Gaussian trap model. Our analysis focuses on five key disorder-dependent quantities defined for a finite chain with $N$ sites: the probability current, its reciprocal (the resistance), the splitting probability, the mean first-passage time $T_N$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_N$ in a periodic chain. By determining the moments of these random variables, we demonstrate that the probability current, resistance, and splitting probability are not self-averaging, which leads to pronounced differences between their average and typical behaviors. In contrast, $T_N$ and $D_N$ become self-averaging when $N \to \infty$, though they exhibit strong sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Inspired Approach for Self-Avoiding Walk (SAWs): 2D lattice and 3D lattice SAWs for single chain enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the application of quantum computing algorithms to enhance the efficiency of enumerating self-avoiding walks (SAWs), utilizing quantum properties such as superposition and interference. A Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE)-based algorithm is developed to enumerate SAWs on both 2D and 3D lattices. In case of 2D square lattice, SAWs up to N=71 steps are successfully enumerated within 26.9 minutes - significantly improving upon the classical algorithm, which required approximately 231 hours(Jensen et al., 2012, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 45, 115202). The algorithm is further extended to 3D cubic lattices, where SAWs up to N=40 steps are enumerated in 13.06 minutes, compared to the classical result of N=36 in 250 hours (Schram et al., 2011, J. Stat. Mech. P06019). These results demonstrate a substantial reduction in computational time, highlighting the potential of quantum computing for combinatorial enumeration problems.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, boundary modes, and the necessity of unnecessary criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We link the presence of "unnecessary" quantum critical surfaces within a single gapped phase of matter to the non-trivial topology of families of gapped Hamiltonians that encircle the critical surface. We study a specific set of one-dimensional spin models where each such family forms a one-parameter loop in a two-dimensional phase diagram. Foliating the non-critical region by such loops identifies "radial" and "angular" coordinates in the phase diagram that respectively parametrize different families and different members of a single family. We show that each one-parameter family is a generalized Thouless charge pump, all with the same topological index, and hence the gapped phase undergoes one or more nontrivial boundary phase transitions as we vary the angular coordinate in a loop through members of one family. Tuning the radial coordinate generates loci of boundary critical points that terminate at endpoints of the bulk unnecessary critical line within the gapped phase. We discuss broader implications of our results and possible extensions to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Support Vector Machine Kernels as Quantum Propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting optimal kernels for regression in physical systems remains a challenge, often relying on trial-and-error with standard functions. In this work, we establish a mathematical correspondence between support vector machine kernels and quantum propagators, demonstrating that kernel efficacy is determined by its spectral alignment with the system's Green's function. Based on this isomorphism, we propose a unified, physics-informed framework for kernel selection and design. For systems with known propagator forms, we derive analytical selection rules that map standard kernels to physical operators. For complex systems where the Green's function is analytically intractable, we introduce a constructive numerical method using the Kernel Polynomial Method with Jackson smoothing to generate custom, physics-aligned kernels. Numerical experiments spanning electrical conductivity, electronic band structure, anharmonic oscillators, and photonic crystals demonstrate that this framework consistently performs well as long as there is an alignment with a Green's function.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in coupled viscoelastic media: A fractional Langevin equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion often arises in complex environments where viscoelastic or crowded conditions influence particle motion. In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a subdiffusive particle ($\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains its intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\alpha&lt;\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\alpha=\beta$) suppress recovery. Our theoretical predictions offer insight into experimentally observed transient anomalous diffusions, such as polymer--protein complexes and cross-linked cytoskeletal networks, highlighting the critical role of memory heterogeneity and mechanical interactions in biological anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Clifford Circuits Augmented Grassmann Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor-network (TN) methods have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can suppress substantial portions of the entanglement structure, effectively alleviating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, once the natural Grassmann-evenness requirement of the fermionic formulation is taken into account and Clifford gates with identical entanglement action are grouped together, the original set of 11520 two-qubit Clifford gates reduces to only 12 distinct gates. This strong reduction leads to a more efficient disentangling scheme within the fermionic framework. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Shaping chaos in bilayer graphene cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene cavities where electrons are confined within finite graphene flakes provide an alluring platform not only for the future nanoelectronic devices owing to the tunable energy gap but also for investigating the quantum nature of chaos due to the trigonal warping of their Fermi surface. Here we demonstrate that rotating the cavity boundary relative to the underlying lattice structure drives a quantum transition from nearly integrable dynamics to chaotic regime, observed as a concomitant crossover of eigenvalue statistics and eigenstate profiles. Complementing the full quantum treatment, we examine the classical backbone of this onset of chaos by employing semiclassical ray dynamics. Our results position bilayer graphene cavities as a promising venue for investigating and engineering quantum-chaotic behavior in graphene-based devices.</description>
