      <title>The ANTARESS workflow I. Optimal extraction of spatially resolved stellar spectra with high-resolution transit spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectrographs open a detailed window onto the atmospheres of stars and planets. As the number of systems observed with different instruments grows, it is crucial to develop a standard in analyzing spectral time series of exoplanet transits and occultations, for the benefit of reproducibility. Here, we introduce the ANTARESS workflow, a set of methods aimed at processing high-resolution spectroscopy datasets in a robust way and extracting accurate exoplanetary and stellar spectra. While a fast preliminary analysis can be run on order-merged 1D spectra and cross-correlation functions (CCFs), the workflow was optimally designed for extracted 2D echelle spectra to remain close to the original detector counts, limit the spectral resampling, and propagate the correlated noise. Input data from multiple instruments and epochs were corrected for relevant environmental and instrumental effects, processed homogeneously, and analyzed independently or jointly. In this first paper, we show how planet-occulted stellar spectra extracted along the transit chord and cleaned from planetary contamination provide a direct comparison with theoretical stellar models and enable a spectral and spatial mapping of the photosphere. We illustrate this application of the workflow to archival ESPRESSO data, using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect Revolutions (RMR) technique to confirm the spin-orbit alignment of HD\,209458b and unveil biases in WASP-76b's published orbital architecture. Because the workflow is modular and its concepts are general, it can support new methods and be extended to additional spectrographs to find a range of applications beyond the proposed scope. In a companion paper, we will present how planet-occulted spectra can be processed further to extract and analyze planetary spectra decontaminated from the star, providing clean and direct measurements of atmospheric properties.</description>

      <title>On the suppression of giant planet formation around low-mass stars in clustered environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Current exoplanet formation studies tend to overlook the birth environment of stars in clustered environments. The effect of this environment on the planet-formation process, however, is important, especially in the earliest stage. Aims: We investigate the differences in planet populations forming in star-cluster environments through pebble accretion and compare these results with the planet formation around isolated stars. We try to provide potential signatures on the young planetary systems to guide future observation. Methods: We design and present a new planet population synthesis code for clustered environments. The planet formation model is based on pebble accretion and includes migration in the circumstellar disk. The disk's gas and dust are evolved in 1D simulations considering the effects of photo-evaporation of the nearby stars. Results: Planetary systems in a clustered environment are different than those born in isolation; the environmental effects are important for a wide range of observable parameters and the eventual architecture of the planetary systems. Planetary systems born in a clustered environment lack cold Jupiters compared to isolated planetary systems. This effect is more pronounced for low-mass stars ($\lesssim$0.2 $M_\odot$). On the other hand, planetary systems born in clusters show an excess of cold Neptune around these low-mass stars. Conclusions: In future observations, finding an excess of cold Neptunes and a lack of cold Jupiters could be used to constrain the birth environments of these planetary systems. Exploring the dependence of cold Jupiter's intrinsic occurrence rate on stellar mass provides insights into the birth environment of their proto-embryos.</description>

      <title>Machine-assisted classification of potential biosignatures in earth-like exoplanets using low signal-to-noise ratio transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for atmospheric biosignatures in Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most pressing challenges in observational astrobiology. Detecting biogenic gases in terrestrial planets requires high resolution and long integration times. In this work, we developed and tested a machine-learning general methodology, intended to classify transmission spectra with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio according to their potential to contain biosignatures. For that purpose, we trained a set of models capable of classifying noisy transmission spectra, as having methane, ozone, and/or water (multilabel classification), or simply as being interesting for follow-up observations (binary classification). The models were trained with $\sim\, 10^6$ synthetic spectra of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1 e, which were generated with the package MultiREx, especially developed for this work. The trained algorithms correctly classified test planets with transmission spectra having SNR $&lt;$ 6 and containing methane and/or ozone at mixing ratios similar to those of modern and Proterozoic Earth. Tests on realistic synthetic spectra based on the current Earth\'s atmosphere show at least one of our models would classify as likely having biosignatures and using only one transit, most of the inhabited terrestrial planets observed with the JWST/NIRSpec PRISM around M-dwarfs located at distances similar or smaller than that of TRAPPIST-1 e. The implication of this result for the designing of observing programs and future surveys is enormous since machine-assisted strategies similar to those presented here could significantly optimize the usage of JWST resources for biosignature searching, while maximizing the chances of a real discovery after dedicated follow-up observations of promising candidates.</description>

      <title>A transiting multi-planet system in the 61 million year old association Theia 116</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing and characterizing young planetary systems can aid in unveiling the evolutionary mechanisms that sculpt the mature exoplanet population. As an all-sky survey, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has expanded the known young planet population as it has observed young comoving stellar populations. This work presents the discovery of a multiplanet system orbiting the 61 Myr old G4V star TIC 434398831 (M = 0.99 Msun, R = 0.91 Rsun, Teff = 5638 K, Tmag = 11.31) located in the Theia 116 comoving population. We estimate the population's age based on rotation periods measured from the TESS light curves, isochrone fitting, and measurements of lithium equivalent widths in the spectra of Theia 116 members. The TESS FFI light curves reveal a mini-Neptune (Rb = 3.51 Rearth, Pb = 3.69 days) and super-Neptune (Rc = 5.63 Rearth, Pc = 6.21 days) with an orbital period ratio slightly larger than 5:3. Follow-up observations from CHEOPS and ground-based telescopes confirm the transits of TIC 434398831 b and c, and constrain their transit times. We explore the potential mass-loss histories of the two planets in order to probe possible initial conditions of the planets immediately after formation.</description>

      <title>Diffraction modelling of a 2023 March 5 stellar occultation by subkilometer-sized asteroid (98943) 2001 CC21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of a stellar occultation event caused by a near-Earth asteroid (98943) 2001 CC21, an upcoming flyby target in the Hayabusa2 extended mission, on March 5, 2023. To accurately determine the asteroid's shape from diffraction-affected light curves, we developed a novel data reduction technique named the Diffracted Occultation's United Simulator for Highly Informative Transient Explorations (DOUSHITE). Using DOUSHITE-generated synthetic models, we derived constraints on (98943) 2001 CC21's shadow shape from the single-chord occultation data. Our results suggest a significant elongation of the shadow with an axis ratio of $b/a = 0.37\pm0.09$. This shape can be crucial for planning Hayabusa2's high-speed flyby to optimise the limited imaging opportunities.</description>

      <title>Disk and atmosphere composition of multi-planet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In protoplanetary disks, small mm-cm-sized pebbles drift inwards which can aid planetary growth and influence the chemical composition of their natal disks. Gaps in protoplanetary disks can hinder the effective inward transport of pebbles by trapping the material in pressure bumps. Here we explore how multiple planets change the vapour enrichment by gap opening. For this, we extend the chemcomp code to include multiple growing planets and investigate the effect of 1, 2 &amp; 3 planets on the water content and C/O ratio in the gas disk as well as the final composition of the planetary atmosphere. We follow planet migration over evaporation fronts and find that previously trapped pebbles evaporate relatively quickly and enrich the gas. We also find that in a multi-planet system, the atmosphere composition can be reduced in carbon and oxygen compared to the case without other planets, due to the blocking of volatile-rich pebbles by an outer planet. This effect is stronger for lower viscosities because planets migrate further at higher viscosities and eventually cross inner evaporation fronts, releasing the previously trapped pebbles. Interestingly, we find that nitrogen remains super-stellar regardless of the number of planets in the system such that super-stellar values in N/H of giant planet atmospheres may be a tracer for the importance of pebble drift and evaporation.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Spectral Model of Main Sequence Stars in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise spectroscopic classification of planet hosts is an important tool of exoplanet research at both the population and individual system level. In the era of large-scale surveys, data-driven methods offer an efficient approach to spectroscopic classification that leverages the fact that a subset of stars in any given survey has stellar properties that are known with high fidelity. Here, we use The Cannon, a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra, to train a generative model of spectra from the Gaia Data Release 3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer. Our model derives stellar labels with precisions of 72 K in Teff , 0.09 dex in log g, 0.06 dex in [Fe/H], 0.05 dex in [{\alpha}/Fe] and 1.9 km/s in vbroad for main-sequence stars observed by Gaia DR3 by transferring GALAH labels, and is publicly available at https://github.com/isabelangelo/gaiaspec. We validate our model performance on planet hosts with available Gaia RVS spectra at SNR&gt;50 by showing that our model is able to recover stellar parameters at {\geq}20% improved accuracy over the existing Gaia stellar parameter catalogs, measured by the agreement with high-fidelity labels from the Spectroscopic Observations of Cool Stars (SPOCS) survey. We also provide metrics to test for stellar activity, binarity, and reliability of our model outputs and provide instructions for interpreting these metrics. Finally, we publish updated stellar labels and metrics that flag suspected binaries and active stars for Kepler Input Catalog objects with published Gaia RVS spectra.</description>

      <title>Destruction of interstellar methyl cyanide (CH3CN) via collisions with He+ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methyl cyanide is one of the simplest interstellar complex organic molecules, widely detected in young solar analogues, shocked regions, protoplanetary disks and comets. CH3CN can be considered a key species to explore the chemical connections between planet forming disks and comets. For such comparison to be meaningful kinetics data for the reactions leading to CH3CN formation and destruction must be updated. We focus on the destruction of methyl cyanide through collisions with He+. A combined experimental and theoretical methodology is employed to obtain cross sections (CSs) and branching ratios (BRs) as a function of collision energy, from which reaction rate coefficients $k(T)$ are calculated in the temperature range from 10 to 300 K. CSs and BRs are measured using a guided ion beam set-up. A theoretical treatment based on an analytical formulation of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the charge exchange process is developed. The method employs a Landau Zener model to obtain reaction probabilities at crossings between the entrance and exit PESs, and an adiabatic centrifugal sudden approximation to calculate CSs and k(T). Rates and BRs differ from those predicted from widely-used capture models. In particular, the rate coefficient at 10 K is estimated to be almost one order of magnitude smaller than what reported in the KIDA database. As for BRs, the charge exchange is completely dissociative and the most abundant fragments are HCCN+/CCNH+, HCNH+ and CH2+. Our results, combined with a revised chemical network for formation of CH3CN, support the hypothesis that methyl cyanide in protoplanetary disks could be mostly the product of gas-phase processes rather than grain chemistry, as currently proposed. These findings are expected to have implications in the comparison of the abundance ratios of N-bearing molecules observed in disks with cometary abundance ratios</description>

      <title>An examination of 'Atri's Eclipse' as described in the Rig Veda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The earliest written reference in Indian astronomy to a total solar eclipse is in the Rig Veda where Rishi Atri is said to have demolished the asura Swarbhanu to liberate the Sun from a total solar eclipse. The Rig Veda describes the occurrence of the eclipse, how the Sun suddenly disappeared in the daytime under the spell of the Asura. The people and gods were scared but the Great Sage Atri saved the Sun and restored his full glory. While discussing the eclipse, Tilak refers to the eclipse as having occurred when the Vernal Equinox was in Orion and three days before the Autumnal Equinox. Based on these data, we identify Atris eclipse as the one that occurred on 22 October 4202 BC or on 19 October 3811 BC.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs: Magnesium and silicon abundances of K7-M5.5 stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the abundances of magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si) for 314 dwarf stars with spectral types in the interval K7.0-M5.5 (Teff range ~4200-3050 K) observed with the CARMENES high-resolution spectrograph at the 3.5 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. Our analysis employs the BT-Settl model atmospheres, the radiative transfer code Turbospectrum, and a state-of-the-art selection of atomic and molecular data. These Mg and Si abundances are critical for understanding both the chemical evolution and assembly of the Milky Way and the formation and composition of rocky planets. Our chemical abundances show a line-to-line scatter at the level of 0.1 dex for all studied spectral types. The typical error bar of our chemical abundance measurements is +- 0.11 dex (Mg) and +- 0.16 dex (Si) for all spectral types based on the comparison of the results obtained for stellar components of multiple systems. The derived abundances are consistent with the galactic evolution trends and observed chemical abundance distribution of earlier FGK-type stars in the solar neighbourhood. Besides, our analysis provides compatible abundances for stars in multiple systems. In addition, we studied the abundances of different galactic stellar populations. In this paper, we also explore the relation of the Mg and Si abundances of stars with and without known planets.</description>

      <title>JOYS+: link between ice and gas of complex organic molecules. Comparing JWST and ALMA data of two low-mass protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rich inventory of complex organic molecules (COMs) has been observed in high abundances in the gas phase toward Class 0 protostars. These molecules are suggested to be formed in ices and sublimate in the warm inner envelope close to the protostar. However, only the most abundant COM, methanol (CH3OH), has been firmly detected in ices before the era of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Now it is possible to detect the interstellar ices of other COMs and constrain their ice column densities quantitatively. We aim to determine the column densities of several oxygen-bearing COMs (O-COMs) in both gas and ice for two low-mass protostellar sources, NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and B1-c, as case studies in our JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program. By comparing the column density ratios w.r.t. CH3OH between both phases measured in the same sources, we can probe into the evolution of COMs from ice to gas in the early stages of star formation. We are able to fit the fingerprints range of COM ices between 6.8 and 8.8 um in the JWST/MIRI-MRS spectra of B1-c using similar components as recently used for IRAS 2A. We claim detection of CH4, OCN-, HCOO-, HCOOH, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, and CH3COCH3 in B1-c, and upper limits are estimated for SO2, CH3COOH, and CH3CN. The comparison of O-COM ratios w.r.t CH3OH between ice and gas shows two different cases. 1) the column density ratios of CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 match well between the two phases, which may be attributed to a direct inheritance from ice to gas or strong chemical links with CH3OH. 2) the ice ratios of CH3CHO and C2H5OH w.r.t. CH3OH are higher than the gas ratios by 1-2 orders of magnitudes. This difference can be explained by the gas-phase reprocessing following sublimation, or different spatial distributions of COMs in the envelope.</description>

      <title>FAUST. XVIII. Evidence for annular substructure in a very young Class 0 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the planet formation process begins in the disks surrounding young stars is still an open question. Annular substructures such as rings and gaps in disks are intertwined with planet formation, and thus their presence or absence is commonly used to investigate the onset of this process. Current observations show a limited number of disks surrounding protostars exhibiting annular substructures, all of them in the Class I stage. The lack of observed features in most of these sources may indicate a late emergence of substructures, but it could also be an artifact of these disks being optically thick. To mitigate the problem of optical depth, we investigate substructures within a very young Class 0 disk characterized by a low inclination using observations at longer wavelengths. We use 3 mm ALMA observations tracing dust emission at a resolution of 7 au to search for evidence of annular substructures in the disk around the deeply embedded Class 0 protostar Oph A SM1. The observations reveal a nearly face-on disk (i$\sim$16$^{\circ}$) extending up to 40 au. The radial intensity profile shows a clear deviation from a smooth profile near 30 au, which we interpret as the presence of either a gap at 28 au or a ring at 34 au with Gaussian widths of $\sigma=1.4^{+2.3}_{-1.2}$ au and $\sigma=3.9^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ au, respectively. The 3 mm emission at the location of the possible gap or ring is determined to be optically thin, precluding the possibility that this feature in the intensity profile is due to the emission being optically thick. Annular substructures resembling those in the more evolved Class I and II disks could indeed be present in the Class 0 stage, earlier than previous observations suggested. Similar observations of embedded disks in which the high optical depth problem can be mitigated are clearly needed to better constrain the onset of substructures in the embedded stages.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of stars with planets in the solar neighbourhood</title>

Abstract: - Aims: We intended to quantify the impact of stellar multiplicity on the presence and properties of exoplanets. - Methods: We investigated all exoplanet host stars at less than 100 pc using the latest astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and advanced statistical methodologies. We complemented our search for common proper motion and parallax companions with data from the Washington Double Star catalogue and the literature. After excluding a number of systems based on radial velocity data, and membership in clusters and open associations, or with resolved ultracool companions, we kept 215 exoplanet host stars in 212 multiple-star systems. - Results: We found 17 new companions in the systems of 15 known exoplanet host stars, measured precise angular and projected physical separations and position angles for 236 pairs of stars, compiled key parameters for 276 planets in multiple systems, and established a comparison sample comprising 687 single stars with exoplanets. With all of this, we statistically analysed a series of hypothesis regarding planets in multiple stellar systems. Although they are only statistically significant at a 2{\sigma} level, our analysis pointed to several interesting results on the comparison in the mean number of planets in multiple versus single stellar systems and the tendency of high mass planets to be located in closer orbits in multiple systems. We confirm that planets in multiple systems tend to have orbits with larger eccentricities than those in single systems. In particular, we found a significant (&gt; 4{\sigma}) preference for planets to exhibit high orbital eccentricities at small ratios between star-star projected physical separations and star-planet semi-major axes.</description>

      <title>Modeling the effectiveness of radiation shielding materials for astronaut protection on Mars</title>

Abstract: The surface of Mars is bombarded by energetic charged particles of solar and cosmic origin with little shielding compared to Earth. As space agencies are planning for crewed missions to the red planet, a major concern is the impact of ionizing radiation on astronaut health. Keeping exposure below acceptable radiation dose levels is crucial for the health of the crew. In this study, our goal is to understand the radiation environment of Mars and describe the main strategies to be adopted to protect astronauts from the harmful impacts of cosmic radiation. Specifically, we investigate the shielding properties of various materials in the Martian radiation field using the Geant4 numerical model, after validating its accuracy with in-situ instrument measurements by MSL RAD. Our results indicate that composite materials such as types of plastic, rubber or synthetic fibers, have a similar response against cosmic rays and are the best shields. Martian regolith has an intermediate behavior and therefore could be used as an additional practical option. We show that the most widely used aluminum could be helpful when combined with other low atomic number materials.</description>

      <title>Observations of Water Frost on Mars with THEMIS: Application to the Presence of Brines and the Stability of (Sub)Surface Water Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the exchange of water between the Martian atmosphere and the (sub)surface is a major challenge for understanding the mechanisms that regulate the water cycle. Here we present a new dataset of water ice detected on the Martian surface with the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS). The detection is based on the correlation between bright blue-white patterns in visible images and a temperature measured in the infrared that is too warm to beassociated with CO2 ice and interpreted instead as water ice. Using this method, we detect ice down to 21.4{\deg}S, 48.4{\deg}N, on the pole-facing slopes at mid-latitudes, and on any surface orientation poleward of 45{\deg} latitude. Water ice observed with THEMIS is most likely seasonal rather than diurnal. Our dataset is consistent with near-infrared spectroscopic data predictions by the Mars Planetary Climate Model. The water frost average temperature is 170 K, and the maximum temperature measured is 243 K, lower than the water ice melting point. We show that the melting of pure water ice on the surface is unlikely due to cooling by latent heat during its sublimation. However, 243 THEMIS images show frosts that are hot enough to form brines if salts are present on the surface. The water vapor pressure at the surface, calculated from the ice temperature, indicates a dry atmosphere in early spring, during the recession of the CO2 ice cap. When it sublimes, the frost acts as a vapor source that is wetter than the near-surface atmosphere, which stabilizes the subsurface ice.</description>

      <title>Diamond phase in space and the possibility of its spectroscopic detection</title>

Abstract: The eventual presence of the diamond carbon allotrope in space is discussed in numerous theoretical and experimental studies. The review summarizes the principal mechanisms of nanodiamond formation and experimental results of spectroscopic and structural investigations of nano- and microdiamonds from meteorites. The size dependence of diamond spectroscopic properties is discussed. Infrared spectroscopy allows detection of C-H bonds on surfaces of hot nanodiamond grains. Spectroscopic observation of nitrogen-related point defects in nanodiamonds is very challenging; moreover, such defects have never been observed in nanodiamonds from meteorites. At the same time, photoluminescence and, eventually, absorption of some impurity-related defects, in particular, of the silicon-vacancy (SiV) center, observed in real meteoritic nanodiamonds opens the possibility of diamond detection in astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Chemical mapping of temperate sub-Neptune atmospheres: Constraining the deep-interior H2O/H2 using the atmospheric CO2/CH4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the planetary envelope composition of sub-Neptune-type exoplanets is challenging due to the inherent degeneracy in their interior composition scenarios. Particularly, the planetary envelope's H2O/H2 ratio, which can also be expressed as the O/H ratio, provides crucial insights into its original location relative to the ice line during planetary formation. Using self-consistent radiative transfer modeling and a rate-based automatic chemical network generator combined with 1D photochemical kinetic-transport atmospheric modeling, we investigate various atmospheric scenarios of temperate sub-Neptunes, ranging from H2-dominated to H2O-dominated atmospheres with equilibrium temperatures (Teq) of 250-400 K. This study includes examples such as K2-18 b (Teq = 255 K), LP 791-18 c (Teq = 324 K), and TOI-270 d (Teq = 354 K). Our models indicate that the atmospheric CO2/CH4 ratio can be used to infer the deep-interior H2O/H2 ratio. Applying this method to recent JWST observations, our findings suggest K2-18 b likely has an interior that is 50% highly enriched in water, exceeding the water content in a 100xZ scenario and suggesting a planetary formation mechanism involving substantial accretion of ices. In contrast, our model suggests that approximately 25% of TOI-270 d's interior is composed of H2O, which aligns with the conventional metallicity framework with a metallicity higher than 100xZ. Furthermore, our models identify carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as strong indicators for temperate sub-Neptunes with at least 10% of their interior composed of water. These results provide a method to delineate the internal composition and formation mechanisms of temperate sub-Neptunes (Teq &lt; ~500 K) via atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of exocomet transits: Insights from \{beta} Pic and KIC 3542116</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the topic of existence and exploration of exocomets has been gaining increasing attention. The asymmetrical decrease in the stellar brightness due to the passage of a comet-like object in front of the star was successfully predicted. It was subsequently confirmed on the basis of the light curves of stars observed by Kepler and TESS orbital telescopes. Since then, there have been successful attempts to fit the asymmetrical dips observed in the stellar light curves utilizing a simple 1D model of an exponentially decaying optically thin dust tail. In this work, we propose fitting the photometric profiles of some known exocomet transits based on a Monte Carlo approach to build up the distribution of dust particles in a cometary tail. As the exocomet prototypes, we used the physical properties of certain Solar System comets belonging to the different dynamical groups and moving at heliocentric distances of 0.6 au, 1.0 au, 5.0 au, and 5.5 au. We obtained a good agreement between the observed and modeled transit light curves. We also show that the physical characteristics of dust particles, such as the particle size range, the power index of dust size distribution, the particle terminal velocity, and distance to the host star affect the shape of the transit light curve, while the dust productivity of the comet nucleus and the impact parameter influence its depth and duration. The estimated dust production rates of the transiting exocomets are at the level of the most active Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Grain Alignment by Magnetically Enhanced Radiative Torques from Multiwavelength Dust Polarization Modeling of HL Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00220v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized the field of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks across multiple wavelengths. Previous observations and empirical modeling suggested multiple mechanisms of dust polarization toward HL Tau, including grain alignment and dust scattering. However, a detailed modeling of dust polarization based on grain alignment physics is not yet available. Here, using our updated POLARIS code, we perform numerical modeling of dust polarization arising from both grain alignment by Magnetically Enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) mechanism and self-scattering to reproduce the HL Tau polarization observed at three wavelengths 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1$\,$mm. Our modeling results show that the observed multi-wavelength polarization could be reproduced only when large grains contain embedded iron inclusions and those with slow internal relaxation must have wrong internal alignment (i.e., the grain's major axis parallel to its angular momentum). The abundance of iron embedded inside grains in the form of clusters is constrained to be $\gtrsim 16$%, and the number of iron atoms per cluster is $N_{\rm cl} \sim 9\times10^2$. Maximum grain sizes probed at wavelengths $\lambda$ = 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1$\,$mm are constrained at $\sim$ 60, 80, and 90$\,\mu$m, respectively.</description>

      <title>Precise and Efficient Orbit Prediction in LEO with Machine Learning using Exogenous Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing volume of space objects in Earth's orbit presents a significant challenge for Space Situational Awareness (SSA). And in particular, accurate orbit prediction is crucial to anticipate the position and velocity of space objects, for collision avoidance and space debris mitigation. When performing Orbit Prediction (OP), it is necessary to consider the impact of non-conservative forces, such as atmospheric drag and gravitational perturbations, that contribute to uncertainty around the future position of spacecraft and space debris alike. Conventional propagator methods like the SGP4 inadequately account for these forces, while numerical propagators are able to model the forces at a high computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose an orbit prediction algorithm utilizing machine learning. This algorithm forecasts state vectors on a spacecraft using past positions and environmental variables like atmospheric density from external sources. The orbital data used in the paper is gathered from precision ephemeris data from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS), for the period of almost a year. We show how the use of machine learning and time-series techniques can produce low positioning errors at a very low computational cost, thus significantly improving SSA capabilities by providing faster and reliable orbit determination for an ever increasing number of space objects.</description>
