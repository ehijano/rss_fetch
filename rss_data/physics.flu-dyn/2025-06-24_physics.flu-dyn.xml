      <title>Relationship between unpredictability and intermittency in shell models of turbulence and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the predictability of turbulent velocity signals using probabilistic analog-forecasting. Here, predictability is defined by the accuracy of forecasts and the associated uncertainties. We study the Gledzer-Ohkitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model of turbulence as well as experimental measurements from a fully developed turbulent flow. In both cases, we identify the extreme values of velocity at small scales as localized unpredictable events that lead to a loss of predictability: worse predictions and increase of their uncertainties. The GOY model, with its explicit scale separation, allows to evaluate the prediction performance at individual scales, and so to better relate the intensity of extreme events and the loss of forecast performance. Results show that predictability decreases systematically from large to small scales. These findings establish a statistical connection between predictability loss across scales and intermittency in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Inferring viscoplastic models from velocity fields: a physics-informed neural network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid-like materials are ubiquitous, spanning from living biological tissues to geological formations, and across scales ranging from micrometers to kilometers. Inferring their rheological properties remains a major challenge, particularly when traditional rheometry fails to capture their complex, three-dimensional, and often heterogeneous behavior. This difficulty is exacerbated by system size, boundary conditions, and other material-specific physical, chemical, or thermal constraints. In this work, we explore whether rheological laws can be inferred directly from flow observations. We propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework designed to learn constitutive viscoplastic laws from velocity field data alone. Our method uses a neural network to interpolate the velocity field, enabling the computation of velocity gradients via automatic differentiation. These gradients are used to estimate the residuals of the governing conservation laws, which implicitly depend on the unknown rheology. We jointly optimize both the constitutive model and the velocity field representation by minimizing the physical residuals and discrepancies from observed data. We validate our approach on synthetic velocity fields generated from numerical simulations using Herschel-Bulkley, Carreau and Panastasiou models under various flow conditions. The algorithm reliably infers rheological parameters, even in the presence of significant noise. We analyze the dependence of inference performance on flow geometry and sampling, highlighting the importance of shear rate distribution in the dataset. Finally, we explore preliminary strategies for model-agnostic inference via embedded model selection, demonstrating the potential of PINNs for identifying the most suitable rheological law from candidate models.</description>

      <title>Growth rate and energy dissipation in wind-forced breaking waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the energy growth and dissipation of wind-forced breaking waves using direct numerical simulations of the coupled air-water Navier-Stokes equations. We vary the wind friction velocity over the wave speed $u_\ast/c$ up to 1. A turbulent wind boundary layer drives the growth of a pre-existing narrowband wave field until it breaks and transfers energy into the water column. Under sustained wind forcing, the wave field then resumes growth. We separately analyze energy transfers during wave growth and breaking-induced dissipation. Energy transfers are dominated by pressure input during growth and turbulent dissipation during breaking. The wave growth rate scales with $(u_\ast/c)^2$, modulated by the wave steepness due to sheltering. The energy dissipation follows the inertial scaling with wave slope at breaking, confirming the universality of the process. Following breaking, near-surface vertical turbulence dissipation profiles scale as $z^{-1}$, with its magnitude controlled by the breaking-induced dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-element software library, IRENE, for numerically solving the steady state and dynamics of a two-dimensional viscous fluid layer embedded in three-dimensional space, on multiple physical scales. The library is designed to handle a wide range of physical regimes -- both low-Reynolds-number and turbulent ones -- and geometries, capturing the coupling between in-plane flows, out-of-plane deformations, surface tension, and elastic response. In addition, the software can treat complex geometries, including those with intra-layer obstacles or arbitrary layer boundaries. We validate IRENE against known analytical and numerical results and demonstrate its capabilities through examples relevant to biological membranes and macroscopic air flows.</description>

      <title>The dominant role of jetting in micron- and sub-micron sea spray produced by bubble bursting: a revised model and comparison with measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary physical mechanism governing the production of sub-micron sea spray aerosols (SSA) -- specifically the competition between film and jet droplets from bubble bursting -- has remained a subject of intense debate. This work presents a revised, first-principles model that establishes the overwhelming dominance of jetting for producing micron and sub-micron aerosols. Our approach first rules out the film droplet mechanism as a primary contributor for this size range by demonstrating through physical scaling and numerical simulations that the final average ejected volume of sub-micron droplets is much smaller than that from jetting. A comprehensive global probability distribution function (PDF) for SSA is constructed by rigorously modeling its fundamental components in sequence: (i) refining the sub-surface bubble size distribution with a simpler and better experimentally supported exponential law, and (ii) deriving consistent number and size distribution models of droplets per bursting event from an ample set of high-resolution numerical simulations. The droplet size PDF from a single bubble follows a highly-skewed distribution -- optimally modeled by a Generalized Inverse Gaussian distribution -- revealing the production of nanometric droplets previously unaccounted for by simpler models. When integrated, these components yield a final predictive model for the global SSA size distribution, with parameters derived directly from physical principles and simulations rather than empirical fitting. The model demonstrates extraordinary predictive accuracy, aligning almost perfectly with experimental data from both laboratory and oceanic measurements, in particular across the critical 25 nm to 2.5 $\mu$m range. This research significantly enhances the fundamental understanding of marine aerosol generation and provides a more accurate foundation for climate and atmospheric chemistry models.</description>

      <title>Basal layer of granular flow down smooth and rough inclines: kinematics, slip laws and rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular flow down an inclined plane is ubiquitous in geophysical and industrial applications. On rough inclines, the flow exhibits Bagnold's velocity profile and follows the so-called $\mu(I)$ local rheology. On insufficiently rough or smooth inclines, however, velocity slip occurs at the bottom and a basal layer with strong agitation emerges below the bulk, which is not predicted by the local rheology. Here, we use discrete element method simulations to study detailed dynamics of the basal layer in granular flows down both smooth and rough inclines. We control the roughness via a dimensionless parameter, $R_a$, varied systematically from 0 (flat, frictional plane) to near 1 (very rough plane). Three flow regimes are identified: a slip regime ($R_a \lesssim 0.45$) where a dilated basal layer appears, a no-slip regime ($R_a \gtrsim 0.6$) and an intermediate transition regime. In the slip regime, the kinematics profiles (velocity, shear rate and granular temperature) of the basal layer strongly deviate from Bagnold's profiles. General basal slip laws are developed which express the slip velocity as a function of the local shear rate (or granular temperature), base roughness and slope angle. Moreover, the basal layer thickness is insensitive to flow conditions but depends somewhat on the inter-particle coefficient of restitution. Finally, we show that the rheological properties of the basal layer do not follow the $\mu(I)$ rheology, but are captured by Bagnold's stress scaling and an extended kinetic theory for granular flows. Our findings can help develop more predictive granular flow models in the future.</description>

      <title>Size distribution of decaying foam bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most studies on the stability of foam bubbles investigated the mechanical stability of thin films between bubbles due to the drainage by gravity. In the current work, we take an alternative approach by assuming the rupture of bubbles as a series of random events and by investigating the time evolution of the size distribution of foam bubbles over a long time up to several hours. For this purpose, we first prepared layers of bubbles on Petri dishes by shaking soap solutions of a few different concentrations, and then we monitored the Petri dishes by using a time-lapse video imaging technique. We analyzed the captured images by custom software to count the bubble size distribution with respect to the initial concentration and elapsed time. From the statistics on our data, we find that the total bubble volume decreases exponentially in time, and the exponent, i.e. the mean lifetime, is a function of the bubble size. The mean lifetimes of larger bubbles are observed to be shorter than those of smaller bubbles, by approximately a factor of 2.</description>

      <title>The mechanism of tornadogenesis from the perspective of vortex tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new theory on tornadogenesis from the perspective of vortex tubes based on Kelvin-Helmholtz Theorems. When the pressure difference between the lowest pressure line from the wall cloud down to the ground and its surroundings is large enough, the increase of vorticity inside the squeezed vortex tube can reach the tornado level, and thus a tornado is born. When the pressure difference increases, the tornado strength increases. When the pressure difference decreases, the tornado strength decreases. The decay of tornadoes is caused by the decreasing pressure difference. This is our theory of the entire tornado lifespan.</description>

      <title>Vortex ring induced by a disk translating toward or away from a wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the time evolution of vortex rings generated by the normal translation of a disk either toward or away from a wall. We systematically vary the control parameters, including the disk size, stroke length, travel time, and distance from the wall, to analyze their influence on vortex dynamics. Experiments are conducted with Particle Image Velocimetry, while numerical simulations are performed using the flow solver Basilisk. The circulation and core radius are used as primary metrics to describe the properties of the vortex ring. A quantitative agreement is observed between the experimental and the numerical results. Both approaches reveal that the vortex circulation increases for disk motions in either direction, toward or away from the wall. However, the effect of the bottom wall on the vortex core radius differs depending on the motion of the disk. The presence of the wall increases the core radius only when the disk moves toward the wall, while no significant effect is observed for a translation away from the wall. Furthermore, we establish scaling laws to describe the maximum circulation and core size of the vortex ring as a function of the control parameters: the disk diameter, the typical time and stroke length of its motion, and the minimal distance from the wall. These scalings, which differ from the unbounded case, contribute to a deeper understanding of vortex dynamics in the vicinity of solid boundaries.</description>

      <title>The Full Nonlinear Vortex Tube-Vorton Method: the post-stall condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original concepts behind The Full Nonlinear Vortex Tube-Vorton Method (FTVM) have been applied to the study of massively separated fluid flow past a thin body. In the pre-stall condition, the Kutta-Zhukovski (KJ) force calculation was successfully implemented. However, for the post-stall condition, this approach is not capable of capturing the form drag component. Thus, an alternative force calculation method is implemented. The results obtained demonstrate that the fluid motion involving complex wake dynamics can be accurately approximated by a low-order, low-discretization numerical method based purely on vorticity and velocity concepts. This method avoids the need to discuss and speculate about the role of pressure on fluid motion, even in the turbulent regime. Consequently, it simplifies the understanding of complex low-speed aerodynamics by returning to the first principles.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Bernoulli-Trial Collisions Families in Treating Rarefied Micro Flows and Hypersonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collision process is essential to the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, as it incorporates the fundamental principles of the Boltzmann and Kac stochastic equations. A series of collision algorithms, known as the Bernoulli-trials (BT) family schemes, have been proposed based on the Kac stochastic equation. The impetus of this paper is to present a comprehensive evaluation of different BT-based collision partner selection schemes, including the simplified Bernoulli-trials (SBT), generalized Bernoulli-trials (GBT), symmetrized and simplified Bernoulli-trials (SSBT), and newly proposed symmetrized and generalized Bernoulli-trials (SGBT), in treating some standard rarefied gas dynamics problems. In these algorithms, the first particle is chosen in a specific order from the list of particles in the cell. For the SBT and GBT, the second particle is chosen from the remaining particles in the list placed after the first particle; however, for SSBT and SGBT, the second particle is chosen from all particles in the list. This means that the SBT and GBT select pairs from the upper triangle of the collision probability matrix, while symmetrized algorithms such as SSBT and SGBT utilize the entire matrix. The results show that the BT-based collision algorithms, compared to the standard "No Time Counter (NTC)" and "Nearest Neighbor (NN)", successfully maintain the collision frequency as the number of particles per cell decreases. Simulation of the Bobylev-Krook-Wu (BKW) exact solution of the Boltzmann equation indicates that, like the GBT, the SGBT algorithm produces the same results as the theory for the average of the 4th moment of the velocity distribution function (VDF).</description>

      <title>JAX-LaB: A High-Performance, Differentiable, Lattice Boltzmann Library for Modeling Multiphase Fluid Dynamics in Geosciences and Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JAX-LaB, a differentiable, Python-based Lattice Boltzmann library for simulating multiphase and multiphysics flows in hydrologic, geologic, and engineered porous media. Built as an extension of the XLB library, JAX-LaB utilizes JAX for computations and offers a performant, hardware-agnostic implementation that integrates seamlessly with machine learning workflows and scales efficiently across CPUs, GPUs, and distributed systems. Multiphase interactions are modeled using the Shan-Chen pseudopotential method, which is coupled with an equation of state and an improved forcing scheme to obtain liquid-vapor densities that are consistent with Maxwell's construction, enabling simulations of systems with very large density ratios while maintaining minimal spurious currents. Wetting is handled using the "improved" virtual density scheme, which allows precise control of contact angles and eliminates non-physical films seen in other Shan-Chen wetting methods. We validate the library through several analytical benchmarks, such as Laplace's law, capillary rise, and cocurrent multicomponent flow, and demonstrate some exemplary use cases for the library. We also report single- and multi-GPU performance scaling of the library. The library is open-source under the Apache license and available at https://github.com/piyush-ppradhan/JAX-LaB.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-free boundary conditions for the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical analysis of the `diffusion-free' boundary conditions recently introduced by Lin and Kerswell for the numerical treatment of inertial waves in a fluid contained in a rotating sphere. We consider here the full setting of the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equation in a general bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2$ or $3$. We show that diffusion-free boundary conditions $$ \Delta u \cdot \tau \vert_{\partial \Omega} = 0, \quad u \cdot n\vert_{\partial \Omega} = 0 \quad \text{ when } d=2, $$ $$ \Delta u \times n\vert_{\partial \Omega} = 0, \quad u \cdot n\vert_{\partial \Omega} = 0 \quad \text{ when } d=3, $$
  allow for a satisfactory well-posedness theory of the full Navier-Stokes equations (global in time for $d=2$, local for $d=3$). Moreover, we perform a boundary layer analysis in the limit of vanishing viscosity $\nu \rightarrow 0$. We establish that the amplitude of the boundary layer flow is in this case of order $\nu$, i.e. much lower than in the case of standard Dirichlet or even stress-free conditions. This confirms analytically that this choice of boundary conditions may be used to reduce diffusive effects in numerical studies relying on the Navier-Stokes equation to approach nearly inviscid solutions.</description>

      <title>Pattern-Based Phase-Separation of Tracer and Dispersed Phase Particles in Two-Phase Defocusing Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the feasibility of a post-processing-based approach for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry for dispersed two-phase flows. The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase, using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV, particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble correlation-based methods are impractical.</description>

      <title>On the Particle Image Overlap in Single Camera Defocusing Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle image (PI) overlap presents a significant challenge in single-camera particle tracking and sizing techniques such as Defocusing Particle Tracking Velocimetry (DPTV) and Interferometric Particle Imaging (IPI). In DPTV, overlap obscures PI boundaries, complicating the detection and accurate estimation of PI diameter and center position, which increases uncertainty in the reconstructed particle positions. In IPI, overlap reduces the usable area of the interference pattern, limiting the accuracy of particle size determination. This study introduces a statistical model to quantify PI overlap independently from the optical setup, source density, or PI size. The model assumes uniformly distributed, uniformly sized circular PIs and is validated against experimental data featuring non-uniform sizes and mild astigmatism (up to aspect ratios of 1.66), demonstrating strong agreement. The present study reveals that the seeding density $\mathcal{S}$ serves as a strong universal scaling parameter for PI overlap. Key overlap metrics, including the number of overlaps per PI, the fraction of overlap-free PIs, and the usable PI area are analyzed as functions of the seeding density $\mathcal{S}$. The results reveal a critical threshold at $\mathcal{S} = 0.25$, where each PI experiences, on average, one overlap. The study provides practical guidance for experimental design by linking overlap metrics to controllable parameters such as source density, defocus length, and aperture diameter. The presented models serve as lookup tools to help experimenters maintain PI overlap within acceptable limits, enabling more reliable and quantitatively robust measurements in DPTV and IPI applications.</description>

      <title>Flux-driven turbulent transport using penalisation in the Hasegawa-Wakatani system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First numerical results from the newly-developed pseudo-spectral code P-FLARE (Penalised FLux-driven Algorithm for REduced models) are presented. This flux-driven turbulence/transport code uses a pseudo-spectral formulation with the penalisation method in order to impose radial boundary conditions. Its concise, flexible structure allows implementing various two dimensional reduced fluid models in flux-driven formulation. Here, results from simulations of the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system are discussed, where particle transport and zonal flow formation, together with profile relaxation, are studied. It is shown that coupled spreading/profile relaxation that one obtains for this system is consistent with a simple one dimensional model of coupled spreading/transport equations. Then, the effect of a source of density is investigated, which results in the observation of sandpile-like critical behaviour. The model displays profile stiffness for certain parameters, with very different input fluxes resulting in very similar mean density gradients. This is due to different zonal flow levels around the critical value for the control parameter (i.e. the ratio of the adiabaticity parameter to the mean gradient) and the existence for this system of a hysteresis loop for the transition from 2D turbulence to a zonal flow dominated state.</description>

      <title>CFD Modelling and Sensitivity-Guided Design of Silicon Filament CVD Reactors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filament-based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for silicon (Si) coatings is often treated as a straightforward adaptation of planar deposition, just with a cylindrical substrate. But this overlooks a fundamental shift in how transport phenomena and reaction kinetics interact. In filament CVD, the filament is not just a substrate; it is the dominant heat source and flow disruptor all in one. In this work, we ask: What really governs Si film growth on filaments? Using a validated three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, we show that filament geometry, thermal gradients, and flow-induced buoyancy do not merely affect uniformity -- they define the very regimes (reaction-limited, transition, diffusion-limited) in which deposition occurs. Our model, validated against three independent experimental studies (R-squared = 0.969), reveals how temperature, flow rate, and reactor layout fundamentally shift the growth dynamics. We show that reducing filament diameter from 2 mm to 500 microns does not just increase local surface area -- it can triple growth rates (up to approximately 39 microns per minute), but only in carefully tuned high-temperature regimes. Similarly, multi-filament setups do not simply scale deposition, they reshape flow fields and compound thermal asymmetries, sometimes improving uniformity, other times worsening it. These effects are not evident without modeling the interplay between transport and kinetics, something experiments alone cannot resolve. To bridge physical understanding with design actionability, we apply global sensitivity analysis via Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Sobol indices. These reveal how in reaction-limited regimes, temperature dominates; in diffusion-limited regimes, reactant transport takes over.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Equations for Well-Conditioned Direct Numerical Simulations of Rapidly Rotating Convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convection is a ubiquitous process driving geophysical/astrophysical fluid flows, which are typically strongly constrained by planetary rotation on large scales. A celebrated model of such flows, rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, has been extensively studied in direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments, but the parameter values attainable by state-of-the-art methods are limited to moderately rapid rotation (Ekman numbers $Ek\gtrsim10^{-8}$), while realistic geophysical/astrophysical $Ek$ are significantly smaller. Asymptotically reduced equations of motion, the nonhydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations (NHQGE), describing the flow evolution in the limit $Ek\to 0$, do not apply at finite rotation rates. The geophysical/astrophysical regime of small but finite $Ek$ therefore remains currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce a new, numerically advantageous formulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to0$, the \textit{Rescaled Rapidly Rotating incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations} (RRRiNSE). We solve the RRRiNSE using a spectral quasi-inverse method resulting in a sparse, fast algorithm to perform efficient DNS in this previously unattainable parameter regime. We validate our results against the literature across a range of $Ek$ and demonstrate that the algorithmic approaches taken remain accurate and numerically stable at $Ek$ as low as $10^{-15}$. Like the NHQGE, the RRRiNSE derive their efficiency from adequate conditioning, eliminating spurious growing modes that otherwise induce numerical instabilities at small $Ek$. We show that the time derivative of the mean temperature is inconsequential for accurately determining the Nusselt number in the stationary state, significantly reducing the required simulation time, and demonstrate that full DNS using RRRiNSE agree with the NHQGE at very small $Ek$.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytical theory is presented for linear, local, short-wavelength instabilities in swirling flows, in which axial shear, differential rotation, radial thermal stratification, viscosity, and thermal diffusivity are all taken into account. A geometrical optics approach is applied to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation, leading to a set of amplitude transport equations. From these, a dispersion relation is derived, capturing two distinct types of instability: a stationary centrifugal instability and an oscillatory, visco-diffusive McIntyre instability. Instability regions corresponding to different axial or azimuthal wavenumbers are found to possess envelopes in the plane of physical parameters, which are explicitly determined using the discriminants of polynomials. As these envelopes are shown to bound the union of instability regions associated with particular wavenumbers, it is concluded that the envelopes correspond to curves of critical values of physical parameters, thereby providing compact, closed-form criteria for the onset of instability. The derived analytical criteria are validated for swirling flows modelled by a cylindrical, differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria unify and extend, to viscous and thermodiffusive differentially heated swirling flows, the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling, differentially heated, visco-diffusive flows, thereby generalising the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed KAN PointNet: Deep learning for simultaneous solutions to inverse problems in incompressible flow on numerous irregular geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have gained attention as an alternative to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for deep learning applications in computational physics, particularly for solving inverse problems with sparse data, as exemplified by the physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (PIKAN). However, the capability of KANs to simultaneously solve inverse problems over multiple irregular geometries within a single training run remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (PI-KAN-PointNet), in which shared KANs are integrated into the PointNet architecture to capture the geometric features of computational domains. The loss function comprises the squared residuals of the governing equations, computed via automatic differentiation, along with sparse observations and partially known boundary conditions. We construct shared KANs using Jacobi polynomials and investigate their performance by considering Jacobi polynomials of different degrees and types in terms of both computational cost and prediction accuracy. As a benchmark test case, we consider natural convection in a square enclosure with a cylinder, where the cylinder's shape varies across a dataset of 135 geometries. PI-KAN-PointNet offers two main advantages. First, it overcomes the limitation of current PIKANs, which are restricted to solving only a single computational domain per training run, thereby reducing computational costs. Second, when comparing the performance of PI-KAN-PointNet with that of the physics-informed PointNet using MLPs, we observe that, with approximately the same number of trainable parameters and comparable computational cost in terms of the number of epochs, training time per epoch, and memory usage, PI-KAN-PointNet yields more accurate predictions, particularly for values on unknown boundary conditions involving nonsmooth geometries.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field amplification during a turbulent collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of whether a dynamo can be triggered by gravitational collapse is of great interest, especially for the early Universe. Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of vorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of the Lorentz force. During a limited time interval, an exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time is interpreted as clear evidence of dynamo action.</description>
