      <title>Chaoticus: a parallel approach to the computation of chaos indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present Chaoticus, a Python-based package for the GPU-accelerated integration of ODE systems and the computation of chaos indicators, including SALI, GALI, Lagrangian Descriptors based indicators and the Lyapunov exponent spectrum. By leveraging GPU parallelization, our package significantly reduces the computation times by several orders of magnitude compared to CPU-based approaches. This significant reduction in computing time facilitates the generation of extensive datasets, crucial for the in-depth analysis of complex dynamics in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven guessing and gluing of unstable periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) are believed to be the underlying dynamical structures of spatio-temporal chaos and turbulence. Finding these UPOs is however notoriously difficult. Matrix-free loop convergence algorithms deform entire space-time fields (loops) until they satisfy the evolution equations. Initial guesses for these robust variational convergence algorithms are thus periodic space-time fields in a high-dimensional state space, rendering their generation highly challenging. Usually guesses are generated with recurrency methods, which are most suited to shorter and more stable periodic orbits. Here we propose an alternative, data-driven method for generating initial guesses, enabled by the periodic nature of the guesses for loop convergence algorithms: while the dimension of the space used to discretize fluid flows is prohibitively large to construct suitable initial guesses, the dissipative dynamics will collapse onto a chaotic attractor of far lower dimension. We use an autoencoder to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the discretized physical space for the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinksy equation, in chaotic and hyperchaotic regimes. In this low-dimensional latent space, we construct loops based on the latent POD modes with random periodic coefficients, which are then decoded to physical space and used as initial guesses. These loops are found to be realistic initial guesses and, together with variational convergence algorithms, these guesses help us to quickly converge to UPOs. We further attempt to `glue' known UPOs in the latent space to create guesses for longer ones. This gluing procedure is successful and points towards a hierarchy of UPOs where longer UPOs shadow sequences of shorter ones.</description>

      <title>On Chaos in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we explore the chaotic behavior of non-integrable QFTs and compare them to integrable ones. We choose as prototypes the double sine-Gordon and the sine-Gordon models. We analyze their discrete spectrum determined by a truncation method. We examine the map of the corresponding energy eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the random matrix theory (RMT) Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). This is done by computing the following properties: (a) The distribution of the adjacent spacings and their ratios (b) Higher order spacings and ratios (c) Pair correlations (d) Spectral form factors and (e) Spectral rigidity. For these properties we determine the differences between the integrable and non-integrable theories and verify that the former admits a Poisson behavior and the latter GOE (apart from the spectral rigidity).</description>
