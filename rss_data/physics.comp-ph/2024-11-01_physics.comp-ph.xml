      <title>Machine learning models with different cheminformatics data sets to forecast the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) regression models along with three cheminformatics data sets (RDkit, Mordred, Morgan) have been used to predict the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). The data consists of cheinformatics descriptors of the electron donor used in 433 OSCs for which the experimental PCE (target variable) is reported in the literature. The donor is either a polymer or a small organic molecule, and the acceptor the fullerene derivatives PCBM or PC71BM. Unlike previous methods, our ML approach considers the type of donor and the acceptor by adding four extra donor's features using the one-hot encoder tool. It is demonstrated that this additional information improves the prediction performance up to 34%. We have also exploited this feature to theoretically forecast the PCE of new OSCs by evaluating the ML model for a different acceptor. It is predicted that more than 50% of the OCSs obtained by exchanging the acceptor would have higher experimental PCE. The prediction accuracy of a given ML approach is analyzed for different PCE intervals. RF using RDkit descriptors resulted in the best ML approach with a Pearson's correlation coefficient for the training and testing sets equal to 0.96 and 0.62, respectively.</description>

      <title>Volumetric lattice Boltzmann method for thermal particulate flows with conjugate heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A volumetric lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is developed for the particle-resolved direct numerical simulation of thermal particulate flows with conjugate heat transfer. This method is devised as a single-domain approach by applying the volumetric interpretation of the LB equation and introducing a solid fraction field to represent the particle. The volumetric LB scheme is employed to enforce the nonslip velocity condition in the solid domain, and a specialized momentum exchange scheme is proposed to calculate the hydrodynamic force and torque acting on the particle. To uniformly solve the temperature field over the entire domain with high numerical fidelity, an energy conservation equation is first derived by reformulating the convection term into a source term. A corresponding LB equation is then devised to automatically achieve the conjugate heat transfer condition and correctly handle the differences in thermophysical properties. Theoretical analysis of this LB equation is also performed to derive the constraints to preserve the numerical fidelity even near the solid-fluid interface. Numerical tests are first performed to validate the present volumetric LB method in various aspects. Then, the sedimentation of a cold particle with conjugate heat transfer in a long channel is investigated. It is found that the sedimentation process can be divided into the accelerating, decelerating, and equilibrium stages. As a further application to dense particulate flows, the sedimentation of 2048 cold particles with conjugate heat transfer in a square cavity is simulated. The particulate Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection is successfully captured in this particle-resolved simulation.</description>

      <title>On Heterogeneous Ising Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines are effective solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems. The idea is mapping the optimal solution(s) to a combinatorial optimization problem to the minimum energy state(s) of a physical system, which naturally converges to and stabilizes at a minimum energy state upon perturbance. The underlying mathematical abstraction, the Ising model, was originally developed to explain dynamic behavior of ferromagnetic materials and was shown to generalize to numerous other physical systems. In a generic optimization problem, each variable can interact with another in different ways. At the same time, problem sizes of practical importance are growing very fast. Unfortunately, both the number and connectivity of spins in hardware are subject to fundamental physical limits. Different problems feature different interaction patterns between variables which may not always directly match the network topology supported by a specific Ising machine. In the presence of a mismatch, emulating generic interactions using the machine topology is usually possible, however, comes at the cost of additional physical spins to facilitate the mapping. Furthermore, mismatches in the problem vs. hardware connectivity render even more physical spins necessary. Combinatorial optimization problems of practical importance come with diverse connectivity patterns, which a rigid network topology in hardware cannot efficiently cover. To bridge the gap between application demand and hardware resources, in analogy to classical heterogeneous chip multiprocessors, in this paper we make the case for heterogeneous Ising multiprocessors, where each Ising core features a different connectivity. We provide a detailed design space exploration and quantify the efficiency of different design options in terms of time or energy to solution along with solution accuracy compared to homogeneous alternatives.</description>

      <title>Enhancing light-matter coupling with electric fields in polar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can enhance light-matter coupling in quantum wells through the quantum-confined Stark effect, by enabling a reduction in well width without shifting the emission to shorter wavelengths. We illustrate this with the paradigmatic example of red-emitting (644 nm-698 nm) AlInGaN heterostructures, which are essential for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels. By systematically exploring their design space with machine learning, we uncover that the globally optimal designs feature extreme internal electric fields exceeding 8 MV/cm. Structural and compositional engineering of electric fields not only offers precise control over the emission wavelength but also boosts the light-emission probability by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structure factors of Warm Dense Matter from Time-Dependent Orbital-Free and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculations of the inelastic part of the dynamical structure factor (DSF) for warm dense matter (WDM) using Time-Dependent Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (TD-OF-DFT) and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic (mixed) Kohn Sham TD-DFT (KS TD-DFT). WDM is an intermediate phase of matter found in planetary cores and laser-driven experiments, where the accurate calculation of the DSF is critical for interpreting X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements. Traditional TD-DFT methods, while highly accurate, are computationally expensive, motivating the exploration of TD-OF-DFT and mixed TD-KS-DFT as more efficient alternatives. We applied these methods to experimentally measured WDM systems, including solid-density aluminum and beryllium, compressed beryllium, and carbon-hydrogen mixtures. Our results show that TD-OF-DFT requires a dynamical kinetic energy potential in order to qualitatively capture the plasmon response. Additionally, it struggles with capturing bound electron contributions and accurately modeling plasmon dynamics without the inclusion of a dynamic kinetic energy potential. In contrast, mixed TD-KS-DFT offers greater accuracy in distinguishing bound and free electron effects, aligning well with experimental data, though at a higher computational cost. This study highlights the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that TD-OF-DFT remains a valuable tool for rapid scans of parameter space, while mixed TD-KS-DFT should be preferred for high-fidelity simulations. Our findings provide insight into the future development of DFT methods for WDM and suggest potential improvements for TD-OF-DFT.</description>

      <title>Projected Neural Differential Equations for Learning Constrained Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural differential equations offer a powerful approach for learning dynamics from data. However, they do not impose known constraints that should be obeyed by the learned model. It is well-known that enforcing constraints in surrogate models can enhance their generalizability and numerical stability. In this paper, we introduce projected neural differential equations (PNDEs), a new method for constraining neural differential equations based on projection of the learned vector field to the tangent space of the constraint manifold. In tests on several challenging examples, including chaotic dynamical systems and state-of-the-art power grid models, PNDEs outperform existing methods while requiring fewer hyperparameters. The proposed approach demonstrates significant potential for enhancing the modeling of constrained dynamical systems, particularly in complex domains where accuracy and reliability are essential.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Ridership Weighting on Targeting and Recovery Strategies for Urban Rail Rapid Transit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resilience of urban rapid transit systems (URTs) to a rapidly evolving threat space is of much concern. Extreme rainfall events are both intensifying and growing more frequent under continuing climate change, exposing transit systems to flooding, while cyber threats and emerging technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles are exposing such systems to targeted disruptions. An imperative has emerged to model how networked infrastructure systems fail and devise strategies to efficiently recover from disruptions. Passenger flow approaches can quantify more dimensions of resilience than network science-based approaches, but the former typically requires granular data from automatic fare collection and suffers from large runtime complexities. Some attempts have been made to include accessible low-resolution ridership data in topological frameworks. However, there is yet to be a systematic investigation of the effects of incorporating low-dimensional, coarsely-averaged ridership volume into topological network science methodologies. We simulate targeted attack and recovery sequences using station-level ridership, four centrality measures, and weighted combinations thereof. Resilience is quantified using two topological measures of performance: the node count of a network's giant connected component (GCC), and a new measure termed the "highest ridership connected component" (HRCC). Three transit systems are used as case studies: the subways of Boston, New York, and Osaka. Results show that centrality-based strategies are most effective when measuring performance via GCC, while centrality-ridership hybrid strategies perform strongest by HRCC. We show that the most effective strategies vary by network characteristics and the mission goals of emergency managers, highlighting the need to plan for strategic adversaries and rapid recovery according to each city's unique needs.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Macroscopic Dynamics from Partial Microscopic Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic observables of a system are of keen interest in real applications such as the design of novel materials. Current methods rely on microscopic trajectory simulations, where the forces on all microscopic coordinates need to be computed or measured. However, this can be computationally prohibitive for realistic systems. In this paper, we propose a method to learn macroscopic dynamics requiring only force computations on a subset of the microscopic coordinates. Our method relies on a sparsity assumption: the force on each microscopic coordinate relies only on a small number of other coordinates. The main idea of our approach is to map the training procedure on the macroscopic coordinates back to the microscopic coordinates, on which partial force computations can be used as stochastic estimation to update model parameters. We provide a theoretical justification of this under suitable conditions. We demonstrate the accuracy, force computation efficiency, and robustness of our method on learning macroscopic closure models from a variety of microscopic systems, including those modeled by partial differential equations or molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Field-Aligned Finite Element Method for Multi-Mode Nonlinear Particle Simulations in tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for simulating plasma instabilities in tokamak plasmas using the piecewise field-aligned finite element method in combination with the particle-in-cell method. Our method traditionally aligns the computational grid but defines the basis functions in piecewise field-aligned coordinates to avoid grid deformation while naturally representing the field-aligned mode structures. This scheme is formulated and implemented numerically. It also applied to the unstructured triangular meshes in principle. We have conducted linear benchmark tests, which agree well with previous results and traditional schemes. Furthermore, multiple-$n$ simulations are also carried out as a proof of principle, demonstrating the efficiency of this scheme in nonlinear turbulence simulations within the framework of the finite element method.</description>

      <title>gSeaGen code by KM3NeT: an efficient tool to propagate muons simulated with CORSIKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration has tackled a common challenge faced by the astroparticle physics community, namely adapting the experiment-specific simulation software to work with the CORSIKA air shower simulation output. The proposed solution is an extension of the open-source code gSeaGen, allowing for the transport of muons generated by CORSIKA to a detector of any size at an arbitrary depth. The gSeaGen code was not only extended in terms of functionalities but also underwent a thorough redesign of the muon propagation routine, resulting in a more accurate and efficient simulation. This paper presents the capabilities of the new gSeaGen code as well as prospects for further developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\textit{invrs-gym}$ is a toolkit for research in nanophotonic inverse design, topology optimization, and AI-guided design. It includes a diverse set of challenges--representing a wide range of photonic design problems--with a common software interface that allows multiple problems to be addressed with a single code. The gym includes lightweight challenges enabling fast iteration as well as challenges involving design of realistic 3D structures, the solutions of which are suitable for fabrication. The gym is designed to be modular, enabling research in areas such as objective functions, design parameterizations, and optimization algorithms, and includes baselines against which new results can be compared. The aim is to accelerate the development and adoption of powerful methods for photonic design.</description>

      <title>Energy-Specific Bethe-Salpeter Equation Implementation for Efficient Optical Spectrum Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an energy-specific Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) implementation for efficient core and valence optical spectrum calculations. In energy-specific BSE, high-lying excitation energies are obtained by constructing trial vectors and expanding the subspace targeting excitation energies above the predefined energy threshold in the Davidson algorithm. To calculate optical spectra over a wide energy range, energy-specific BSE can be applied to multiple consecutive small energy windows, where trial vectors for each subsequent energy window are made orthogonal to the subspace of preceding windows to accelerate the convergence of the Davidson algorithm. For seven small molecules, energy-specific BSE combined with $G_0W_0$ provides small errors around 0.8 eV for absolute and relative $K$-edge excitation energies when starting from a hybrid PBEh solution with 45\% exact exchange. We further showcase the computational efficiency of this approach by simulating the N $1s$ $K$-edge excitation spectrum of the porphine molecule and the valence optical spectrum of silicon nanoclusters involving 5,000 excited states using $G_0W_0$-BSE. This work expands the applicability of the $GW$-BSE formalism for investigating high-energy excited states of large systems.</description>

      <title>FireBench: A High-fidelity Ensemble Simulation Framework for Exploring Wildfire Behavior and Data-driven Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background. Wildfire research uses ensemble methods to analyze fire behaviors and assess uncertainties. Nonetheless, current research methods are either confined to simple models or complex simulations with limits. Modern computing tools could allow for efficient, high-fidelity ensemble simulations. Aims. This study proposes a high-fidelity ensemble wildfire simulation framework for studying wildfire behavior, ML tasks, fire-risk assessment, and uncertainty analysis. Methods. In this research, we present a simulation framework that integrates the Swirl-Fire large-eddy simulation tool for wildfire predictions with the Vizier optimization platform for automated run-time management of ensemble simulations and large-scale batch processing. All simulations are executed on tensor-processing units to enhance computational efficiency. Key results. A dataset of 117 simulations is created, each with 1.35 billion mesh points. The simulations are compared to existing experimental data and show good agreement in terms of fire rate of spread. Computations are done for fire acceleration, mean rate of spread, and fireline intensity. Conclusions. Strong coupling between these 2 parameters are observed for the fire spread and intermittency. A critical Froude number that delineates fires from plume-driven to convection-driven is identified and confirmed with literature observations. Implications. The ensemble simulation framework is efficient in facilitating parametric wildfire studies.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Structure Solutions from Nanocrystalline Powder Diffraction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in materials science is the determination of the structure of nanometer sized objects. Here we present a novel approach that uses a generative machine learning model based on diffusion processes that is trained on 45,229 known structures. The model factors both the measured diffraction pattern as well as relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic cluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the information-scarce finite-size broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find that our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve simulated nanocrystals as small as 10 angstroms across 200 materials of varying symmetry and complexity, including structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can successfully and verifiably determine structural candidates four out of five times, with average error among these candidates being only 7% (as measured by post-Rietveld refinement R-factor). Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving structures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments. We suggest that data driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical simulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of previously unsolved nano-materials.</description>

      <title>Univariate Conditional Variational Autoencoder for Morphogenic Patterns Design in Frontal Polymerization-Based Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under some initial and boundary conditions, the rapid reaction-thermal diffusion process taking place during frontal polymerization (FP) destabilizes the planar mode of front propagation, leading to spatially varying, complex hierarchical patterns in thermoset polymeric materials. Although modern reaction-diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP, the inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions that produce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the non-unique and non-intuitive mapping between process conditions and manufactured patterns. In this work, we propose a probabilistic generative model named univariate conditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design of hierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing. Unlike the cVAE, which encodes both the design space and the design target, the UcVAE encodes only the design space. In the encoder of the UcVAE, the number of training parameters is significantly reduced compared to the cVAE, resulting in a shorter training time while maintaining comparable performance. Given desired pattern images, the trained UcVAE can generate multiple process condition solutions that produce high-fidelity hierarchical patterns.</description>

      <title>Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty of DFT calculated mechanical and structural properties of solids due to incompatibility of pseudopotentials and exchange-correlation functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for pseudopotentials constructed for a given exchange-correlation (XC) functional far exceeds the supply, necessitating the use of those commonly available. The number of XC functionals currently available is in the hundreds, if not thousands, and the majority of pseudopotentials have been generated for the LDA and PBE. The objective of this study is to identify the error in the determination of the mechanical and structural properties (lattice constant, cohesive energy, surface energy, elastic constants, and bulk modulus) of crystals calculated by DFT with such inconsistency. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the performance of popular XC functionals (LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN) for these calculations in a consistent manner.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Finite-Size Scaling of the Four-Dimensional Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-theoretical calculations predict that, at the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$, the finite-size scaling (FSS) behaviors of the Ising model would be modified by multiplicative logarithmic corrections with thermal and magnetic correction exponents $(\hat{y}_t, \hat{y}_h)=(1/6,1/4)$. Using high-efficient cluster algorithms and the lifted worm algorithm, we present a systematic study of the FSS of the four-dimensional Ising model in the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) bond and loop representations. Our numerical results reveal the FSS behaviors of various geometric and physical quantities in the three representations, offering robust evidence for the logarithmic correction form conjectured by the field theory. In particular, clear evidence is obtained for the existence of $\hat{y}_t=1/6$ in the loop representation, while it is difficult to extract in the spin representations, because of mixing with the Gaussian-fixed-point asymptotics. In the FK-bond representation, the multiplicative logarithmic correction for the second-largest cluster is also numerically observed to be governed by an exponent $\hat{y}_{h2} = -1/4$ with its exact value unknown yet.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpolation-Based Method for Solving the One-Dimensional Wave Equation on a Domain with a Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16483v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a domain with moving boundary. In J. Math. Phys. 11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.</description>

      <title>Simulating real-time molecular electron dynamics efficiently using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared to ground state electronic structure optimizations, accurate simulations of molecular real-time electron dynamics are usually much more difficult to perform. To simulate electron dynamics, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) has been shown to offer an attractive compromise between accuracy and cost. However, many simulation parameters significantly affect the quality and efficiency of a TDDMRG simulation. So far, it is unclear whether common wisdom from ground state DMRG carries over to the TDDMRG, and a guideline on how to choose these parameters is missing. Here, in order to establish such a guideline, we investigate the convergence behavior of the main TDDMRG simulation parameters, such as time integrator, the choice of orbitals, and the choice of MPS representation for complex-valued non-singlet states. In addition, we propose a method to select orbitals that are tailored to optimize the dynamics. Lastly, we showcase the TDDMRG by applying it to charge migration ionization dynamics in furfural, where we reveal a rapid conversion from an ionized state with a $\sigma$ character to one with a $\pi$ character within less than a femtosecond.</description>
