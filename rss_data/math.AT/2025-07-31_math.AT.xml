      <title>Finite abelian group actions on weakly Lefschetz cohomologically symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite abelian group actions on weakly Lefschetz cohomologically symplectic (WLS) manifolds, a collection of manifolds that includes all compact connected Kaehler manifolds. We prove that for any WLS manifold $X$ there exists a number $C$ such that, for any integer $m\geq C$, if $({\mathbf Z}/m)^k$ acts freely on $X$, then $\sum_j b_j(X;{\mathbf Q})\geq 2^k$.
  We also prove a structure theorem for effective actions on WLS manifolds of $({\mathbf Z}/p)^r$, where $p$ is a big enough prime, analogous to some results for tori of Lupton and Oprea, and we find bounds on the discrete degree of symmetry of WLS manifolds.
  Our technique, which may be of independent interest, is based on studying the cohomology of abelian covers of WLS manifolds $X$ associated to certain maps $\pi:X\to T^k$. We prove that, in the presence of actions of arbitrarily big finite abelian groups, some of these abelian covers have finitely generated cohomology, and the spectral sequence associated to $\pi$ degenerates at the second page over the rationals.</description>

      <title>Kan Approximations of the Persistent Homology Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent homology transform (PHT) of a subset $M \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a map $\text{PHT}(M):\mathbb{S}^{d-1} \to \mathbf{Dgm}$ from the unit sphere to the space of persistence diagrams. This map assigns to each direction $v\in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ the persistent homology of the filtration of $M$ in direction $v$. In practice, one can only sample the map $\text{PHT}(M)$ at a finite set of directions $A \subset \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. This suggests two natural questions: (1) Can we interpolate the PHT from this finite sample of directions to the entire sphere? If so, (2) can we prove that the resulting interpolation is close to the true PHT? In this paper we show that if we can sample the PHT at the module level, where we have information about how homology from each direction interacts, a ready-made interpolation theory due to Bubenik, de Silva, and Nanda using Kan extensions can answer both of these questions in the affirmative. A close inspection of those techniques shows that we can infer the PHT from a finite sample of heights from each direction as well. Our paper presents the first known results for approximating the PHT from finite directional and scalar data.</description>

      <title>Monomial polarization and depolarization of abstract simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We translate the operations of polarization and depolarization from monomial ideals in a polynomial ring to abstract simplicial complexes. As a result, we explicitly describe the relation between the Koszul simplicial complex of a monomial ideal and that of its polarization. Using the simplicial translation of depolarization we propose a way to reduce a simplicial complex to a smaller one with the same homology. This type of reduction, that can be interpreted as non-elementary collapse, can be used as a pre-process step for algorithms on simplicial complexes. We apply this methodology to the efficient computation of the Alexander dual of abstract simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Reflection Equivariance and the Heisenberg Picture for Spaces of Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monoidal product, braiding, balancing and weak duality are pieces of algebraic information that are well-known to have their origin in oriented genus zero surfaces and their mapping classes. More precisely, each of them correspond to operations of the cyclic framed $E_2$-operad. We extend this correspondence to include another algebraic piece of data, namely the modified trace, by showing that it amounts to a homotopy fixed point structure with respect to the homotopy involution that reverses the orientation of surfaces and dualizes the state spaces. We call such a homotopy fixed point structure reflection equivariance. As an application, we describe the effect of orientation reversal on spaces of conformal blocks and skein modules in the non-semisimple setting, throughout relying on their factorization homology description. This has important consequences: For a modular functor that is reflection equivariant relative to a rigid duality, i) the circle category is modular, and the resulting mapping class group representations are automatically the ones built by Lyubashenko, and ii) the resulting internal skein algebras have one simple representation, carrying a unique projective mapping class group representation making the action equivariant. While i) is a new topological characterization of not necessarily semisimple modular categories, ii) generalizes the implicit description of spaces of conformal blocks purely through the representation theory of moduli algebras given by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus from rational conformal field theories admitting a Hopf algebra description to finite rigid logarithmic conformal field theories. This also generalizes several results of Faitg from ribbon factorizable Hopf algebras to arbitrary modular categories.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Correlators in Finite Rigid Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a not necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of constructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The correlator construction given in this article generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of Fuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational special case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the extension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm principle. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a holographic description, with the main difference that the holographic principle is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description is used to prove that the coefficients of the torus partition function are non-negative integers. Moreover, we show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent system of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it is equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of pivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations formulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Cohomology ring of non-compact abelian arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a Orlik-Solomon type presentation for the cohomology ring of arrangements in a non-compact abelian Lie group. The new insight consists in comparing arrangements in different abelian groups. Our work is based on the Varchenko-Gelfand ring for real hyperplane arrangements and from that we deduce the cohomology rings of all other abelian arrangements. As by-product, we obtain a new proof of the Orlik-Solomon relations and De Concini-Procesi ones.</description>

      <title>Computing a Connection Matrix and Persistence Efficiently from a Morse Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Morse decompositions partition the flows in a vector field into equivalent structures. Given such a decomposition, one can define a further summary of its flow structure by what is called a connection matrix.These matrices, a generalization of Morse boundary operators from classical Morse theory, capture the connections made by the flows among the critical structures - such as attractors, repellers, and orbits - in a vector field. Recently, in the context of combinatorial dynamics, an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute connection matrices has been proposed in~\cite{DLMS24}. We show that, actually, the classical persistence algorithm with exhaustive reduction retrieves connection matrices, both simplifying the algorithm of~\cite{DLMS24} and bringing the theory of persistence closer to combinatorial dynamical systems. We supplement this main result with an observation: the concept of persistence as defined for scalar fields naturally adapts to Morse decompositions whose Morse sets are filtered with a Lyapunov function. We conclude by presenting preliminary experimental results.</description>

      <title>The Non-Orientable Four-Ball Genus of a New Infinite Family of Torus Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend previous work by using a combination of band surgeries and known bounds to compute $\gamma_4(T_{4n, (2n\pm1)^2 + 4n-2}) = 2n-1$ for all $n \geq 1$. We further generalize this result by showing that $\gamma_4(T_{4n + 2k, n(4n + 2k) - 1}) = \gamma_4(T_{4n + 2k, (n+2)(4n + 2k) - 1}) = 2n-1 + k$ for all $n \geq 1$ and $k \geq 0$. All knots in this family are counterexamples to Batson's conjecture.</description>
