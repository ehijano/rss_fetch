      <title>Platinum: Path-Adaptable LUT-Based Accelerator Tailored for Low-Bit Weight Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models demands more efficient hardware. Quantization offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and performance. With ultra-low-bit quantization, there are abundant opportunities for results reuse, and thus it can be boosted with lookup tables (LUTs) based acceleration. However, existing LUT-based methods suffer from computation and hardware overheads for LUT construction, and rely solely on bit-serial computation, which is suboptimal for ternary-weight networks. We propose Platinum, a lightweight ASIC accelerator for integer weight mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) using LUTs. Platinum reduces LUT construction overhead via offline-generated construction paths and supports both general bit-serial and optimized ternary-weight execution through adaptive path switching. On BitNet b1.58-3B, Platinum achieves up to 73.6x, 4.09x, and 2.15x speedups over SpikingEyeriss, Prosperity, and 16-thread T-MAC (CPU), respectively, along with energy reductions of 32.4x, 3.23x, and 20.9x, all within a 0.96mm2 chip area. This demonstrates the potential of LUT-based ASICs as efficient, scalable solutions for ultra-low-bit neural networks on edge platforms.</description>

      <title>CADC: Crossbar-Aware Dendritic Convolution for Efficient In-memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are computationally intensive and often accelerated using crossbar-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures. However, large convolutional layers must be partitioned across multiple crossbars, generating numerous partial sums (psums) that require additional buffer, transfer, and accumulation, thus introducing significant system-level overhead. Inspired by dendritic computing principles from neuroscience, we propose crossbar-aware dendritic convolution (CADC), a novel approach that dramatically increases sparsity in psums by embedding a nonlinear dendritic function (zeroing negative values) directly within crossbar computations. Experimental results demonstrate that CADC significantly reduces psums, eliminating 80% in LeNet-5 on MNIST, 54% in ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, 66% in VGG-16 on CIFAR-100, and up to 88% in spiking neural networks (SNN) on the DVS Gesture dataset. The induced sparsity from CADC provides two key benefits: (1) enabling zero-compression and zero-skipping, thus reducing buffer and transfer overhead by 29.3% and accumulation overhead by 47.9%; (2) minimizing ADC quantization noise accumulation, resulting in small accuracy degradation - only 0.01% for LeNet-5, 0.1% for ResNet-18, 0.5% for VGG-16, and 0.9% for SNN. Compared to vanilla convolution (vConv), CADC exhibits accuracy changes ranging from +0.11% to +0.19% for LeNet-5, -0.04% to -0.27% for ResNet-18, +0.99% to +1.60% for VGG-16, and -0.57% to +1.32% for SNN, across crossbar sizes from 64x64 to 256x256. Ultimately, a SRAM-based IMC implementation of CADC achieves 2.15 TOPS and 40.8 TOPS/W for ResNet-18 (4/2/4b), realizing an 11x-18x speedup and 1.9x-22.9x improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing IMC accelerators.</description>

      <title>Aquas: Enhancing Domain Specialization through Holistic Hardware-Software Co-Optimization based on MLIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application-Specific Instruction-Set Processors (ASIPs) built on the RISC-V architecture offer specialization opportunities for various applications. However, existing frameworks from the open-source RISC-V ecosystem suffer from limited performance due to restricted hardware synthesis and rigid compiler support. To address these challenges, we introduce Aquas, a holistic hardware-software co-design framework built upon MLIR. Aquas enhances ASIP synthesis with fast memory access capability via a burst DMA engine and advanced high-level synthesis (HLS) optimizations. On the compiler side, we propose an e-graph based retargetable approach with a novel matching engine for efficient instruction matching. Evaluation demonstrates up to 9.27x speedup on real-world workloads, including point cloud processing and LLM inference.</description>

      <title>FADiff: Fusion-Aware Differentiable Optimization for DNN Scheduling on Tensor Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), such as Large Language Models (LLMs), on tensor accelerators is essential for maximizing computational efficiency in modern AI systems. However, achieving this is challenging due to the enormous and complex design space created by the interaction of intra-layer mapping and inter-layer fusion. In this work, we present FADiff, a gradient-based optimization framework capable of automatically identifying high-quality intra-layer mapping and inter-layer fusion strategies to accelerate inference for DNN workloads. We first construct a unified and differentiable analytical cost model, which accurately predicts the energy and latency of both single-layer mappings and various layer fusion strategies. Then, by encoding discrete constraints into the loss function, we employ a gradient-based approach to efficiently explore the vast design space, determining the optimal joint strategy for mapping and fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FADiff, achieving better optimization in terms of energy and latency compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>3RSeT: Read Disturbance Rate Reduction in STT-MRAM Caches by Selective Tag Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent development in memory technologies has introduced Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) as the most promising replacement for SRAMs in on-chip cache memories. Besides its lower leakage power, higher density, immunity to radiation-induced particles, and non-volatility, an unintentional bit flip during read operation, referred to as read disturbance error, is a severe reliability challenge in STT-MRAM caches. One major source of read disturbance error in STT-MRAM caches is simultaneous accesses to all tags for parallel comparison operation in a cache set, which has not been addressed in previous work. This paper first demonstrates that high read accesses to tag array extremely increase the read disturbance rate and then proposes a low-cost scheme, so-called Read Disturbance Rate Reduction in STT-MRAM Caches by Selective Tag Comparison (3RSeT), to reduce the error rate by eliminating a significant portion of tag reads. 3RSeT proactively disables the tags that have no chance for hit, using low significant bits of the tags on each access request. Our evaluations using gem5 full-system cycle-accurate simulator show that 3RSeT reduces the read disturbance rate in the tag array by 71.8%, which results in 3.6x improvement in Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). In addition, the energy consumption is reduced by 62.1% without compromising performance and with less than 0.4% area overhead.</description>

      <title>The Immutable Tensor Architecture: A Pure Dataflow Approach for Secure, Energy-Efficient AI Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on consumer edge devices is throttled by the "Memory Wall" -- the prohibitive bandwidth and energy cost of fetching gigabytes of model weights from DRAM for every token generated. Current architectures (GPUs, NPUs) treat model weights as mutable software data, incurring massive energy penalties to maintain general-purpose programmability. We propose The Immutable Tensor Architecture (ITA), a paradigm shift that treats model weights not as data, but as physical circuit topology. By encoding parameters directly into the metal interconnects and logic of mature-node ASICs (28nm/40nm), ITA eliminates the memory hierarchy entirely. We present a "Split-Brain" system design where a host CPU manages dynamic KV-cache operations while the ITA ASIC acts as a stateless, ROM-embedded dataflow engine.</description>

      <title>Cohet: A CXL-Driven Coherent Heterogeneous Computing Framework with Hardware-Calibrated Full-System Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional heterogeneous computing systems built on PCIe interconnects suffer from inefficient fine-grained host-device interactions and complex programming models. In recent years, many proprietary and open cache-coherent interconnect standards have emerged, among which compute express link (CXL) prevails in the open-standard domain after acquiring several competing solutions. Although CXL-based coherent heterogeneous computing holds the potential to fundamentally transform the collaborative computing mode of CPUs and XPUs, research in this direction remains hampered by the scarcity of available CXL-supported platforms, immature software/hardware ecosystems, and unclear application prospects. This paper presents Cohet, the first CXL-driven coherent heterogeneous computing framework. Cohet decouples the compute and memory resources to form unbiased CPU and XPU pools which share a single unified and coherent memory pool. It exposes a standard malloc/mmap interface to both CPU and XPU compute threads, leaving the OS dealing with smart memory allocation and management of heterogeneous resources. To facilitate Cohet research, we also present a full-system cycle-level simulator named SimCXL, which is capable of modeling all CXL sub-protocols and device types. SimCXL has been rigorously calibrated against a real CXL testbed with various CXL memory and accelerators, showing an average simulation error of 3%. Our evaluation reveals that CXL.cache reduces latency by 68% and increases bandwidth by 14.4x compared to DMA transfers at cacheline granularity. Building upon these insights, we demonstrate the benefits of Cohet with two killer apps, which are remote atomic operation (RAO) and remote procedure call (RPC). Compared to PCIe-NIC design, CXL-NIC achieves a 5.5 to 40.2x speedup for RAO offloading and an average speedup of 1.86x for RPC (de)serialization offloading.</description>

      <title>GAVINA: flexible aggressive undervolting for bit-serial mixed-precision DNN acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voltage overscaling, or undervolting, is an enticing approximate technique in the context of energy-efficient Deep Neural Network (DNN) acceleration, given the quadratic relationship between power and voltage. Nevertheless, its very high error rate has thwarted its general adoption. Moreover, recent undervolting accelerators rely on 8-bit arithmetic and cannot compete with state-of-the-art low-precision (&lt;8b) architectures. To overcome these issues, we propose a new technique called Guarded Aggressive underVolting (GAV), which combines the ideas of undervolting and bit-serial computation to create a flexible approximation method based on aggressively lowering the supply voltage on a select number of least significant bit combinations. Based on this idea, we implement GAVINA (GAV mIxed-precisioN Accelerator), a novel architecture that supports arbitrary mixed precision and flexible undervolting, with an energy efficiency of up to 89 TOP/sW in its most aggressive configuration. By developing an error model of GAVINA, we show that GAV can achieve an energy efficiency boost of 20% via undervolting, with negligible accuracy degradation on ResNet-18.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Execution of Bayesian Neural Networks using a Single Probabilistic Forward Pass and Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models perform well across domains such as diagnostics, weather forecasting, NLP, and autonomous driving, but their limited uncertainty handling restricts use in safety-critical settings. Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Integer Representations in IEEE 754, Posit, and Takum Arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although not primarily designed for this purpose, floating-point numbers are often used to represent integral values, with some applications explicitly relying on this capability. However, the integral representation properties of IEEE 754 floating-point numbers have not yet been formally investigated. Recently, the bfloat16, posit and takum machine number formats have been proposed as alternatives to IEEE 754, while OCP 8-bit floating point (OFP8) types (E4M3 and E5M2) have been introduced as 8-bit extensions of IEEE 754, albeit with slight deviations from the standard. It is therefore timely to evaluate IEEE 754 and to assess how effectively the new formats fulfil this function in comparison with the standard they aim to replace.
  This paper presents the first rigorous derivations and proofs of the integral representation capabilities of IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, OFP8, bfloat16, posits, and takums. We examine both the exact number of bits required to represent a given integer and the largest consecutive integer representable with a specified bit width. The results show that OFP8 yields mixed outcomes, bfloat16 generally underperforms, and posits fail to scale effectively, whereas takums consistently match or outperform the other formats, maintaining backward compatibility with IEEE 754.</description>

      <title>Chiplet-Based RISC-V SoC with Modular AI Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18355v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining architectural flexibility is a critical challenge in the development and deployment of edge AI devices. Monolithic SoC designs struggle with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI acceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer: adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring streaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement, and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations. These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads. These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency, scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device applications.</description>

      <title>Splatonic: Architecture Support for 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM via Sparse Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising direction for SLAM due to its high-fidelity reconstruction and rapid convergence. However, 3DGS-SLAM algorithms remain impractical for mobile platforms due to their high computational cost, especially for their tracking process.
  This work introduces Splatonic, a sparse and efficient real-time 3DGS-SLAM algorithm-hardware co-design for resource-constrained devices. Inspired by classical SLAMs, we propose an adaptive sparse pixel sampling algorithm that reduces the number of rendered pixels by up to 256$\times$ while retaining accuracy. To unlock this performance potential on mobile GPUs, we design a novel pixel-based rendering pipeline that improves hardware utilization via Gaussian-parallel rendering and preemptive $\alpha$-checking. Together, these optimizations yield up to 121.7$\times$ speedup on the bottleneck stages and 14.6$\times$ end-to-end speedup on off-the-shelf GPUs. To further address new bottlenecks introduced by our rendering pipeline, we propose a pipelined architecture that simplifies the overall design while addressing newly emerged bottlenecks in projection and aggregation. Evaluated across four 3DGS-SLAM algorithms, Splatonic achieves up to 274.9$\times$ speedup and 4738.5$\times$ energy savings over mobile GPUs and up to 25.2$\times$ speedup and 241.1$\times$ energy savings over state-of-the-art accelerators, all with comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>PRO-V-R1: Reasoning Enhanced Programming Agent for RTL Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Register-Transfer Level (RTL) verification is a primary bottleneck consuming 60-70% of development time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for RTL automation, their performance and research focus have overwhelmingly centered on RTL generation rather than verification. Current methods for RTL verification rely on large scale proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate Python-based functional references, incurring a high cost and raising data-privacy risks. To date, an end-to-end open-source solution for autonomous verification remains absent.
  We introduce PRO-V-R1, the first trainable open-source agentic framework for autonomous RTL verification. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we design PRO-V sys, a modular agentic system that couples LLM-based reasoning with programmatic tool use for RTL verification; (2) we establish a data construction pipeline that leverages existing RTL datasets to build simulation-validated, expert-level trajectories tailored for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) RTL verification agents; and (3) we implement an efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses verification-specific rewards derived from program-tool feedback to optimize the end-to-end verification workflow. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates PRO-V-R1 achieves a 57.7% functional correctness rate and 34.0% in robust fault detection, significantly outperforming the base model's 25.7% and 21.8% (respectively) from the state-of-the-art (SOTA) automatic verification system. This configuration also outperforms large-scale proprietary LLMs in functional correctness and shows comparable robustness for fault detection.</description>
