      <title>Artificial Intelligence Generates Stereotypical Images of Scientists but Can Also Detect Them: A Pilot Study Using the Draw-A-Scientist Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How the general public perceives scientists has been of interest to science educators for decades. While there can be many factors of it, the impact of recent generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is noteworthy, as these are rapidly changing how people acquire information. This report presents the pilot study examining how modern generative AI represents images of scientist using the Draw-A-Scientist Test (DAST). As a data, 1,100 images of scientist were generated using Midjourney v 6.1. One hundred of these images were analyzed by a science education scholar using a DAST scoring rubric. Using the data, the researcher went through prompt engineering to instruct gpt-4.1-mini to automatically analyze the remaining 1,000 images. The results show that generative AI represents stereotypical images of scientists, such as lab coat (97%), eyeglasses (97%), male gender (81%), and Caucasian (85%) in the 100 images analyzed by the researcher. However, gpt-4.1-mini could also detect those stereotypes in the accuracy of 79% in the same 100 images. gpt-4.1-mini also analyzed the remaining 1,000 images and found stereotypical features in the images (lab coat: 97%, eyeglasses: 95%, male gender: 82%, Caucasian: 67%). Discussions on the biases residing in today's generative AI and their implications on science education were made. The researcher plans to conduct a more comprehensive future study with an expanded methodology.</description>

      <title>Smartphone-Based Undergraduate Physics Labs: A Comprehensive Review of Innovation, Accessibility, and Pedagogical Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smartphone-integrated physics laboratories (SmartIPLs) have emerged as scalable and cost-effective alternatives to traditional lab instruction, providing accessible, hands-on experiences for diverse learning environments. This review synthesizes over a decade of research, covering nearly 200 SmartIPLs across key physics domains such as mechanics, optics, acoustics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and modern physics. SmartIPLs are categorized into two primary types: sensor-based experiments using built-in smartphone tools and camera-based video/image analysis for motion and optical studies. Empirical studies show that SmartIPLs support equal or greater gains in conceptual understanding, science process skills, and student engagement, especially in remote and under-resourced settings. The review explores their theoretical foundations, compares them to traditional and virtual labs, and addresses challenges such as device variability and classroom integration. Future directions include broader curricular integration, AI-driven student feedback, expansion into underrepresented physics topics, interdisciplinary applications, and equity-focused instructional design. Open-access resources, such as the UGA SmartPhone Intro Physics Lab and Modern Optics YouTube channels and the SPIE book Use of Smartphones in Optical Experimentation, highlight community-driven efforts to expand and democratize physics education. As smartphone technology advances, SmartIPLs will offer a promising path toward adaptive, intelligent, and inclusive laboratory instruction for the 21st century.</description>

      <title>Simple and accurate nonlinear pendulum motion for the full range of amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple closed-form formula for the period of a pendulum with finite amplitude is proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the small and large amplitude limits, while in the mid-amplitude range maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications. Its unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss a finite amplitude pendulum. A simple and formally exact solution of angular displacement for the full range of amplitudes is illustrated.</description>
