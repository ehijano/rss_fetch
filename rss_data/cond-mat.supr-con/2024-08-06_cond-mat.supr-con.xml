      <title>YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ Josephson diode operating as a high-efficiency ratchet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a focused He$^+$ beam for nanopatterning and writing of Josephson barriers we fabricated specially shaped Josephson junctions of in-line geometry in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ thin film microbridges with an asymmetry ratio of critical currents of opposite polarities (non-reciprocity ratio) $\approx 7$ at optimum magnetic field. Those Josephson diodes were subsequently used as ratchets to rectify an applied ac current into a dc voltage. We also demonstrate the operation of such a ratchet in the loaded regime, where it produces a nonzero dc output power and yields a thermodynamic efficiency of up to $75\,\mathrm{\%}$. The ratchet shows record figures of merit: an output dc voltage of up to $212\,\mathrm{\mu V}$ and an output power of up to $0.2\,\mathrm{nW}$. The device has an essential area $\approx 1\,\mathrm{\mu m^2}$. For rectification of quasistatic Gaussian noise, the figures of merit are more modest, however the efficiency can be as high as for the deterministic ac drives within some regimes. Since the device is based on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$, it can operate at temperatures up to $\sim40\,\mathrm{K}$, where more noise is available for rectification.</description>

      <title>Contrasting electron-phonon interaction between electron- and hole-doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin- and charge-lattice interactions are potential key factors in the microscopic mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Although both interactions can dramatically shape the low-energy electronic structure, their phenomenological roles in superconductivity are usually investigated independently. Employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the spectroscopic fingerprint of short-range antiferromagnetic order in conjunction with enhanced electron-phonon interaction in the electron-doped cuprate superconductor $\mathrm{Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_4}$. The observed mode coupling exhibits a strong momentum dependence that is in striking contrast to the node-antinode dichotomy previously observed in the hole-doped cuprates. Our results reveal an intimate relationship between electron-phonon coupling and antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which collectively sets the stage for unconventional superconductivity in the electron-doped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Thouless energy in Josephson SN-N-NS bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the Thouless energy in Josephson superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SN-N-NS) bridges analytically and numerically, taking into account the influence of the sub-electrode regions. We have found a significant suppression of the Thouless energy with increasing interfacial resistance, in agreement with experimental results. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the critical current in Josephson junctions in comparison with the expressions for the Thouless energy may allow the determination of the interface parameters of S and N-layers.</description>

      <title>Field-free Josephson diode effect in altermagnet/normal metal/altermagnet junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field-free and highly efficient diodes with the nonreciprocity of supercurrent are believed to be the core block of the superconducting computing devices without dissipation. In this paper, we propose a Josephson diode based upon altermagnets with the vanishing net macroscopic magnetization. The nonreciprocity of supercurrent can be realized without applying any external magnetic field or ferromagnetic exchange field, which can avoid the magnetic cross-talk between the basic elements of the devices. The high efficiency exceeding $40\%$ can be obtained and the efficiency shows the high stability when the structure parameters are changed. The diode efficiency is antisymmetric about the relative orientation angle of the superconducting leads, so that its sign can easily be inverted by adjusting the relative orientation angle. The symmetries satisfied by the current-phase difference relations and the diode efficiency are analyzed by considering the transformations of the junctions under the time-reversal, the spin-rotation and the mirror reflection operations. The high efficiency and the high stability of the Josephson diode effect in our junctions provide the possibility for the design of the field-free dissipationless diode devices.</description>

      <title>Helical $f$-Wave Superconductivity in Cubic Rashba Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear-in-$k$ Rashba spin-orbit coupling is crucial for achieving topological superconductivity. The wave vector dependence of this spin-orbit coupling can vary across materials, exhibiting linear, cubic, or a combination of both forms. Notably, cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling induces a distinct triple spin winding on the Fermi surface, differentiating it from linear Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In this Letter, we investigate the potential for two-dimensional topological superconductivity in an interacting bilayer Rashba spin-orbit coupled system with local inversion symmetry breaking. We discover an intriguing interplay between the unique spin texture induced by cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling and odd-parity Cooper pairing mechanisms. This interplay leads to a mirror symmetry-protected topological crystalline superconductor hosting three pairs of Majorana edge modes associated with an effective helical $f$-wave Cooper pairing. The bulk topology of the helical $f$-wave superconductor is characterized by a mirror Chern number $n_M=3$, which remains stable even in the presence of coexisting linear and cubic Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our work not only proposes an approach to engineering topological mirror superconductors but also uncovers a pathway to realizing rare helical $f$-wave pairing.</description>

      <title>Parameters dependent superconducting transition temperature in high temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of the superconducting transition temperature in relation to doping and interaction strengths is one of the most challenging problems in high temperature superconductivity. By refining determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, we characterize the parameter dependence of the superconducting transition temperature within a bilayer Hubbard model, which is sign-problem-free at arbitrary filling. A striking feature of this model is its similarities to the bilayer nickelate-based superconductor $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$, where superconductivity emerge from the bilayer $\mathrm{Ni}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ planes. We find that interlayer spin-exchange $J$ is critical to interlayer pairing, ant that on-site interaction $U$ contributes negatively to superconductivity at low doping levels but positively to it at high doping levels. Our findings identify the key parameter dependent superconducting transition temperature in nickelate-based superconductors and provide a new understanding of the high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconducting thin films of (Cu,C)Ba$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{9+\delta}$ with zero resistance transition temperature close to 100 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High superconducting transition temperature is favorable for the applications of superconductors. Some cuprate superconductors have the transition temperatures above 100 K, such as the Hg- or Tl-based 1223 and 1234 phases, but many of them contain the toxic elements, like Hg and Tl. Meanwhile, the high anisotropy makes the vortices easy to move, thus the irreversibility magnetic field is very low in the liquid nitrogen temperature region. Here we report the successful synthesis of superconducting thin films (Cu,C)Ba$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_3$O$_{9+\delta}$ with the zero-resistance transition temperature reaching 99.7 K. The film shows a very good crystallinity with (00l) orientation. The superconducting transitions are rather sharp as revealed by both resistivity and magnetization measurements. Temperature dependent resistivity has been measured under different magnetic fields along c-axis and ab-plane, and the irreversibility lines have been achieved. The resistivity was also measured at different temperatures with the magnetic field rotated in the ac-plane, and the data can be nicely scaled by using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model, yielding a temperature dependent anisotropy which varies from 17 at 110 K to 4 at 77 K. We also measured the magnetization-hysteresis-loops and calculated the critical current density through the Bean critical state model. The critical current density at 77 K is about 6$\times$10$^5$ A/cm$^2$ (zero field), thus the film may be a good candidate for the applications of superconducting cables or the high frequency superconducting filters.</description>

      <title>Topological p-wave Superconductors with Disorder and Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). % This phase may be equally realized with two quantum Ising spin chains coupled through a spin interaction along $z$ direction. In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experiments in monolayer iron-based superconductors, we theoretically investigate properties of a two-dimensional multiband superconductor, focusing on two aspects. First, for vortex bound states, the spatial anisotropy and positions of electron density peaks are associated with interband couplings. Second, even with inversion symmetry, there allows a Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, leading to the enhanced in-plane upper critical field.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of Co-Doped CaKFe4As4 Investigated via Point-Contact Spectroscopy and London Penetration Depth Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iron-based superconductors (IBSs) of the recently discovered 1144 class, unlike many other IBSs, display superconductivity in their stoichiometric form and are intrinsically hole doped. The effects of chemical substitutions with electron donors are thus particularly interesting to investigate. Here, we study the effect of Co substitution in the Fe site of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ single crystals on the critical temperature, on the energy gaps, and on the superfluid density by using transport, point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy (PCARS), and London penetration depth measurements. The pristine compound (T$_\mathrm{c}\simeq$ 36 K) shows two isotropic gaps whose amplitudes ($\Delta_1$ = 1.4$-$3.9 meV and $\Delta_2$ = 5.2$-$8.5 meV) are perfectly compatible with those reported in the literature. Upon Co doping (up to $\approx$7% Co), T$_\mathrm{c}$ decreases down to $\simeq$ 20 K, the spin-vortex-crystal order appears, and the low-temperature superfluid density is gradually suppressed. PCARS and London penetration depth measurements perfectly agree in demonstrating that the nodeless multigap structure is robust upon Co doping, while the gap amplitudes decrease as a function of T$_\mathrm{c}$ in a linear way with almost constant values of the gap ratios 2$\Delta_i$/k$_\mathrm{B}$T$_\mathrm{c}$.</description>

      <title>Superradiant emission stimulated by vortex-antivortex pair production in layered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report numerical simulations of coupled sine-Gordon and heat diffusion equations describing dynamic states stimulated by a trapped vortex driven by dc current in a stack of up to $N=321$ Josephson junctions. It is shown that the Cherenkov wake behind the vortex shuttle trapped in the stack can trigger proliferation of counter-propagating vortices and antivortices which get synchronized and form large-amplitude standing electromagnetic waves. This happens if the dc current density $J$ exceeds a threshold value $J_s$ which can be well below the Josephson interlayer critical current density $J_c$ for underdamped junctions. The cavity modes stimulated by the vortex-antivortex pair production cause peaks in the radiated power $P_N(J)$ with a nearly monochromatic spectrum at discrete values of $J$ corresponding to the zero-field Fiske resonances. The power $P_N(J)$ was evaluated for small rectangular stacks in the magneto-dipole approximation and for large stacks in a single mode state. For small stacks, the highest peak in $P_N(J)$ increases rapidly, $P_N\propto N^6$, with the number of junctions at $N\leq 81$ and gradually slows down to $P_N\propto N^2$ at $161\leq N\leq 321$. For stacks larger than the radiated wavelength, we obtained $P_N\propto N^5$ at $N\lesssim 200-300$ and $P_N\propto N^2$ at larger $N$. For stacks with up to $321$ junctions and representative parameters of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, we observed moderate overheating and no hotspots. The vortex-antivortex pair production can amplify THz radiation from Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ mesas for which trapping Josephson vortices could be used to stimulate THz emission at subcritical currents and optimize the radiation output.</description>

      <title>Strong pairing and symmetric pseudogap metal in double Kondo lattice model: from nickelate superconductor to tetralayer optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and study a double Kondo lattice model which hosts robust superconductivity. The system consists of two identical Kondo lattice model, each with Kondo coupling $J_K$ within each layer, while the localized spin moments are coupled together via an inter-layer on-site antiferromagnetic spin coupling $J_\perp$. We consider the strong $J_\perp$ limit, wherein the local moments tend to form rung singlets and are thus gapped. However, the Kondo coupling $J_K$ transmits the inter-layer entanglement between the local moments to the itinerant electrons. Consequently, the itinerant electrons experience a strong inter-layer antiferromangetic spin coupling and form strong inter-layer pairing, which is confirmed through numerical simulation in one dimensional system. Experimentally, the $J_K \rightarrow -\infty$ limits of the model describes the recently found bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, while the $J_K&gt;0$ side can be realized in tetralayer optical lattice of cold atoms. Two extreme limits, $J_K \rightarrow -\infty$ and $J_K \rightarrow +\infty$ limit are shown to be simplified to a bilayer type II t-J model and a bilayer one-orbital t-J model, respectively. Thus, our double Kondo lattice model offers a unified framework for nickelate superconductor and tetralayer optical lattice quantum simulator upon changing the sign of $J_K$. We highlight both the qualitative similarity and the quantitative difference in the two sides of $J_K$. Finally, we discuss the possibility of a symmetric Kondo breakdown transition in the model with a symmetric pseudogap metal corresponding to the usual heavy Fermi liquid.</description>

Abstract: The recently discovered high-T$_C$ superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has sparked renewed interest in the unconventional superconductivity. Here we study superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model, using the renormalized mean-field theory. Our results reveal a robust $s^\pm-$wave pairing driven by the inter-layer $d_{z^2}$ magnetic coupling, which exhibits a transition temperature within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally observed $T_c \sim 80$ K. We establish a comprehensive superconducting phase diagram in the doping plane. Notably, the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure is found situated roughly in the optimal doping regime of the phase diagram. When the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital becomes close to half-filling, $d-$wave and $d+is$ pairing can emerge from the system. We discuss the interplay between Fermi surface topology and different pairing symmetries. The stability of the $s^\pm-$wave pairing against Hund's coupling and other magnetic exchange couplings is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate supercurrent nonreciprocal effects in a superconducting weak-link hosting distinct types of vortices. We demonstrate how the winding number of the vortex, its spatial configuration and the shape of the superconducting lead can steer the sign and amplitude of the supercurrent rectification. We find a general criterion for the vortex pattern to maximize the rectification amplitude of the supercurrent. The underlying strategy is the search of specific vortex core position yielding a vanishing amplitude of the supercurrent first harmonic. We also prove that supercurrent nonreciprocal effects can be used to diagnose high-winding vortex and to distinguish between different types of vorticity. Our results thus provide a toolkit to control the supercurrent rectification by means of vortex phase textures and nonreciprocal signatures to detect vortex states with nonstandard phase patterns.</description>

Abstract: Using a known distribution of the Meissner currents over the surface of an infinitely long superconducting slab with a rectangular cross section, we find an applied magnetic field at which vortices begin to penetrate into the superconductor. This vortex-penetration field is determined by an interplay of the geometrical and Bean-Livingston barriers. The obtained results enable one to find the lower critical field and the London penetration depth from measurements of the magnetic induction on the surface of the superconducting slab, using, e.g., the micro-Hall probes.</description>

      <title>Coherence Length of Electronic Nematicity in Iron-Based Superconductors</title>

Abstract: Recent developments in laser-excited photoemission electron microscopy (laser-PEEM) advance the visualization of electronic nematicity and nematic domain structures in iron-based superconductors. In FeSe and BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.87}$P$_{0.13}$)$_2$ superconductors, it has been reported that the thickness of the electronic nematic domain walls is unexpectedly long, leading to the formation of mesoscopic nematicity wave [T. Shimojima $\textit{et al.}$, Science $\textbf{373}$ (2021) 1122]. This finding demonstrates that the nematic coherence length $\xi_{\rm nem}$ can be decoupled from the lattice domain wall. Here, we report that the electronic domain wall thickness shows a distinct variation in related materials: it is similarly long in FeSe$_{0.9}$S$_{0.1}$ whereas it is much shorter in undoped BaFe$_2$As$_2$. We find a correlation between the thick domain walls and the non-Fermi liquid properties of normal-state resistivity above the nematic transition temperature. This suggests that the nematic coherence length can be enhanced by underlying spin-orbital fluctuations responsible for the anomalous transport properties.</description>

      <title>A simple electronic ladder model harboring $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions</title>

Abstract: Parafermions are anyons with the potential for realizing non-local qubits that are resilient to local perturbations. Compared to Majorana zero modes, braiding of parafermions implements an extended set of topologically protected quantum gates. This, however, comes at the price that parafermionic zero modes can not be realized in the absence of strong interactions whose theoretical description is challenging. In the present work, we construct a simple lattice model for interacting spinful electrons with parafermionic zero energy modes. The explicit microscopic nature of the considered model highlights new realization avenues for these exotic excitations in recently fabricated quantum dot arrays. By density matrix renormalization group calculations, we identify a broad range of parameters, with well-localized zero modes, whose parafermionic nature is substantiated by their unique $8\pi$ periodic Josephson spectrum.</description>

      <title>Efficient Cooper Pair Splitting Without Interactions</title>

Abstract: For the three-terminal NSN device with single-mode normal terminals and without Coulomb blockade, we propose the interpretation of charge transfer process which allows us to consistently characterize the device operation as that of a Cooper pair splitter in terms of scattering matrix elements as well as in terms of measurable quantities. The obtained explicit expression for the splitting probability notably contains the two-particle interference term not available from conductance measurements. We show that splitting doesn't necessarily rely on single-particle crossed Andreev reflection amplitude thus allowing for the unit efficiency at zero energy. Our results imply that the current cross-correlator generally doesn't provide definite measure of splitting.</description>

      <title>Modeling phonon-mediated quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting qubit arrays</title>

Abstract: Correlated errors caused by ionizing radiation impacting superconducting qubit chips are problematic for quantum error correction. Such impacts generate quasiparticle (QP) excitations in the qubit electrodes, which temporarily reduce qubit coherence significantly. The many energetic phonons produced by a particle impact travel efficiently throughout the device substrate and generate quasiparticles with high probability, thus causing errors on a large fraction of the qubits in an array simultaneously. We describe a comprehensive strategy for the numerical simulation of the phonon and quasiparticle dynamics in the aftermath of an impact. We compare the simulations with experimental measurements of phonon-mediated QP poisoning and demonstrate that our modeling captures the spatial and temporal footprint of the QP poisoning for various configurations of phonon downconversion structures. We thus present a path forward for the operation of superconducting quantum processors in the presence of ionizing radiation.</description>

Abstract: In metals, low-energy effective theories are characterized by a set of coupling functions. Among them, the angle-dependent Fermi momentum specifies the size and shape of Fermi surface. Since the Fermi momentum grows incessantly under the renormalization group flow, a metallic fixed point is defined only modulo a rescaling of Fermi momentum. In this paper, we discuss the physical consequences of this projective nature of fixed points for non-Fermi liquids with hot Fermi surfaces. The first is the absence of a unique dynamical critical exponent that dictates the relative scaling between energy and momentum. The second is mismatches between the scaling dimensions of couplings and their relevancy. Nonetheless, each projective fixed point is characterized by a few marginal and relevant coupling functions, and the notion of universality survives. We illustrate our findings by charting the space of projective fixed points and extracting their universal properties for the Ising-nematic quantum critical metal beyond the patch theory. To control the theory, we use the dimensional regularization scheme that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface. Near the upper critical dimension, two exactly marginal coupling functions span the space of stable projective fixed points: functions that specify the shape of the Fermi surface and the angle-dependent Fermi velocity. All other coupling functions, including the Landau functions and the universal pairing interaction, are fixed by those two marginal functions. With decreasing dimensions, the forward scattering remains irrelevant while the pairing interaction becomes relevant near two dimensions. In two dimensions, it is expected that the universal superconducting fluctuations lower the symmetry of the non-Fermi liquid realized above the superconducting transition temperatures from the loop U(1) group to a proper subgroup.</description>

      <title>Tying knots in particle physics</title>

Abstract: Lord Kelvin's pioneering hypothesis that the identity of atoms is knots of vortices of the aether had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics and physics despite being subsequently refuted by experiments. While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a "knot dominated era" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Only-phase Popov action: thermodynamic derivation and superconducting electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a thermodynamic derivation of the only-phase Popov action functional, which is often adopted to study the low-energy effective hydrodynamics of a generic nonrelativistic superfluid. It is shown that the crucial assumption is the use of the saddle point approximation after neglecting the quantum-pressure term. As an application, we analyze charged superfluid (superconductors) coupled to the electromagnetic field at zero temperature. Our only-phase and minimally-coupled theory predicts the decay of the electrostatic field inside a superconductor with a characteristic length much smaller than the London penetration depth of the static magnetic field. This result is confirmed also by a relativistic only-phase Popov action we obtain from the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian.</description>
