      <title>Power-law banded random matrix ensemble as a model for quantum many-body Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonians of one-dimensional, disordered single-particle systems with long-range hopping terms can naturally be modeled by power-law banded random matrices. In this picture, the phase diagram of a power-law banded random matrix ensemble show ergodic, weakly ergodic, multifractal, and localized phases. Motivated by recent developments on ergodicity breaking and localization in interacting quantum many-body systems, we explore many-body interpretations of the power-law banded random matrix ensemble. We discuss a number of ways to label the basis vectors with many-body configurations, and compare the physical properties of the resulting Hamiltonians. We characterize the scaling of the many-body eigenstate entanglement entropy with system size for the different labeling schemes and in each of the phases. Using a scaling analysis on the full sets of eigenstates, we subsequently provide a quantitative picture of the boundary between the different types of scaling behavior that we observe for the spectral-bulk and spectral-edge eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Graph-Dynamics correspondence in metallic glass-forming liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical challenges in understanding the nature of glass and the glass transition remain significant open questions in statistical and condensed matter physics. As a prototypical example of complex physical systems, glasses and the vitrification process have been central research topics, consistently attracting broad scientific interest. This focus has driven extensive studies on phenomena such as aging, non-exponential relaxation, dynamic anomalies, glass-forming ability, and the mechanical response of glasses under stress. Recent advances in computational and experimental techniques have enabled rigorous testing of theoretical models, shedding new light on glassy behavior. However, the intrinsic complexity of glass and the glass transition that lies in their physics, which spans multiple length and time scales, makes the system challenging to characterize. In this review, we emphasize the need to move beyond conventional approaches and propose a topological perspective as a promising alternative to address these challenges. Specifically, our findings reveal that the diversity in particle relaxation behavior is statistically linked to a global topological feature of the transient network structures formed by the particles in a given liquid. This direction offers opportunities to uncover novel phenomena that could fundamentally reshape our understanding of glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Effective conductivity of conduit networks with random conductivities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective conductivity ($T^{eff}$) of 2D and 3D Random Resistor Networks (RRNs) with random edge conductivity is studied. The combined influence of geometrical disorder, which controls the overall connectivity of the medium and leads to percolation effects, and conductivity randomness is investigated. A formula incorporating connectivity aspects and second-order averaging methods, widely used in the stochastic hydrology community, is derived and extrapolated to higher orders using a power averaging formula based on a mean-field argument. This approach highlights the role of the so-called resistance distance introduced by graph theorists. Simulations are performed on various RRN geometries constructed from 2D and 3D bond-percolation lattices. The results confirm the robustness of the power averaging technique and the relevance of the mean-field assumption.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of a disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quenched disorder in a solid state system can result in Anderson localization where electrons are exponentially localized and the system behaves like an insulator. In this study, we investigate the effect of a DC electric field on Anderson localization. The study highlights the case of a one-dimensional insulator chain with on-site disorder when a DC electric field is applied throughout the chain. We study spectral properties of an Anderson localized system in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium using a full lattice nonequilibrium Green's function method in the steady-state limit. Tuning the disorder and the electric field strength results in the creation of exponential Lifshitz tails near the band edge by strongly localized levels. These Lifshtiz tails create effects like insulator-to-metal transitions and contribute to non-local hopping. The electric field causes gradual delocalization of the system and Anderson localization crossing over to Wannier Stark ladders at very strong fields. Our study makes a comparison with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) highlighting some major differences and similarities in the physics of disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning's remarkable practical successes have sparked extensive theoretical investigations, yet fundamental breakthroughs remain elusive. Here, we study neural network training via gradient descent and demonstrate that the resulting dynamics can be described by a field theory in de Sitter space. We illustrate this correspondence with a simple example of neural network in which the continuum limit is explicitly realized. Since de Sitter space is well-studied in both field theory and general relativity, our findings suggest new avenues for understanding neural network training and for leveraging established theoretical frameworks to advance machine learning theory.</description>

      <title>Extreme resilience and dissipation in heterogeneous disordered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long range order and symmetry in heterogeneous materials architected on crystal lattices lead to elastic and inelastic anisotropies and thus limit mechanical functionalities in particular crystallographic directions. Here, we present a facile approach for designing heterogeneous disordered materials that exhibit nearly isotropic mechanical resilience and energy dissipation capabilities. We demonstrate, through experiments and numerical simulations on 3D-printed prototypes, that near-complete isotropy can be attained in the proposed heterogeneous materials with a small, finite number of random spatial points. We also show that adding connectivity between random subdomains leads to much enhanced elastic stiffness, plastic strength, energy dissipation, shape recovery, structural stability and reusability in our new heterogeneous materials. Overall, our study opens avenues for the rational design of a new class of heterogeneous materials with isotropic mechanical functionalities for which the engineered disorder throughout the subdomains plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Universality classes in the time evolution of epidemic outbreaks on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the temporal evolution of epidemic outbreaks in complex networks and identify two distinct universality classes governing their spreading dynamics. Using analytical arguments and large-scale simulations of the susceptible-infected (SI) model, we show that epidemic prevalence follows either a Gompertz-like curve in small-world networks or an Avrami-like curve in fractal complex networks. These findings challenge the traditional mean-field prediction of early-stage exponential growth of infections and highlight the crucial role of network topology in shaping epidemic dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the widely used mean-field approximation, even in its heterogeneous form, fails to accurately describe epidemic spreading, as the assumption of early exponential growth is not justified in either universality class. Additionally, we show that in fractal networks, the basic reproduction number loses its traditional predictive power, as the spreading dynamics are instead governed by microscopic scaling exponents of the network's self-similar structure. This shift underscores the need to revise classical epidemiological models when applied to systems with fractal topology. Our findings provide a refined theoretical framework for modeling spreading processes in complex networks, offering new perspectives for epidemic prediction and control.</description>

      <title>Canonical equilibrium of mean-field $O(n)$~models in presence of random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study canonical-equilibrium properties of Random Field $O(n)$ Models involving classical continuous vector spins of $n$ components with mean-field interactions and subject to disordered fields acting on individual spins. To this end, we employ two complementary approaches: the mean-field approximation, valid for any disorder distribution, and the replica trick, applicable when the disordered fields are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. On the basis of an exact analysis, we demonstrate that when replica symmetry holds, both the approaches yield identical expression for the free energy per spin of the system. As consequences, we study the case of $n=2$ ($XY$ spins) and that of $n=3$ (Heisenberg spins) for two representative choices of the disorder distribution, namely, a Gaussian and a symmetric bimodal distribution. For both $n=2$ and $n=3$, we demonstrate that while the magnetization exhibits a continuous phase transition as a function of temperature for the Gaussian case, the transition could be either continuous or first-order with an emergent tricriticality when the disorder distribution is bimodal. We also discuss in the context of our models the issue of self-averaging of extensive variables near the critical point of a continuous phase transition.</description>

      <title>Long-range hopping in a quasiperiodic potential weakens the non-Hermitian skin effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model characterized by power-law hoppings ($1/s^{a}$) and a quasi-periodic parameter $\beta$, where $a$ denotes the power-law index, $s$ represents the hopping distance, and $\beta$ belongs to the metallic mean family. In the intermediate phases, we find that ergodic states correspond to complex eigenvalues, multifractal states to real eigenvalues, and localized states may exhibit either complex or real eigenvalues. Moreover, both real and complex energy spectra emerge in the localized phase, with real spectra attributed to pseudo-Hermiticity. Under open boundary conditions, our analysis of fractal dimensions and eigenstates reveals that all ergodic states transform into skin states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that long-range hoppings weaken the skin effect, offering another perspective for exploring non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

      <title>Discovering dynamic laws from observations: the case of self-propelled, interacting colloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14846v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter spans a wide range of time and length scales, from groups of cells and synthetic self-propelled particles to schools of fish, flocks of birds, or even human crowds. The theoretical framework describing these systems has shown tremendous success at finding universal phenomenology. However, further progress is often burdened by the difficulty of determining the forces that control the dynamics of the individual elements within each system. Accessing this local information is key to understanding the physics dominating the system and to create the models that can explain the observed collective phenomena. In this work, we present a machine-learning model, a graph neural network, that uses the collective movement of the system to learn the active and two-body forces controlling the individual dynamics of the particles. We verify our approach using numerical simulations of active brownian particles, considering different interaction potentials and levels of activity. Finally, we apply our model to experiments of electrophoretic Janus particles, extracting the active and two-body forces that control the dynamics of the colloids. Due to this, we can uncover the physics dominating the behavior of the system. We extract an active force that depends on the electric field and also area fraction. We also discover a dependence of the two-body interaction with the electric field that leads us to propose that the dominant force between these colloids is a screened electrostatic interaction with a constant length scale. We expect that this methodology can open a new avenue for the study and modeling of experimental systems of active particles.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classes of classical stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic symmetry classification of the Markov generators of classical stochastic processes. Our classification scheme is based on the action of involutive symmetry transformations of a real Markov generator, extending the Bernard-LeClair scheme to the arena of classical stochastic processes and leading to a set of up to fifteen allowed symmetry classes. We construct families of solutions of arbitrary matrix dimensions for five of these classes with a simple physical interpretation of particles hopping on multipartite graphs. In the remaining classes, such a simple construction is prevented by the positivity of entries of the generator particular to classical stochastic processes, which imposes a further requirement beyond the usual symmetry classification constraints. We partially overcome this difficulty by resorting to a stochastic optimization algorithm, finding specific examples of generators of small matrix dimensions in six further classes, leaving the existence of the final four allowed classes an open problem. Our symmetry-based results unveil new possibilities in the dynamics of classical stochastic processes: Kramers degeneracy of eigenvalue pairs, dihedral symmetry of the spectra of Markov generators, and time reversal properties of stochastic trajectories and correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same packing fractions, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy dynamically witnesses many-body localized phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems which fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.</description>
