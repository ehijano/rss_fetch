      <title>On a Chouinard's formula for $C$-quasi-injective dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $C$-quasi-injective dimension is a recently introduced homological invariant that unifies and extends the notions of quasi-injective dimension and of injective dimension with respect to a semidualizing module, previously studied by Gheibi and by Takahashi and White, respectively. In the main results of this paper, we provide extensions of the Bass' formula and a version of the Chouinard's formula for modules of finite $C$-quasi-injective dimension over an arbitatry ring.</description>

      <title>An unrestricted notion of the finite factorization property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonzero element of an integral domain (or commutative cancellative monoid) is called atomic if it can be written as a finite product of irreducible elements (also called atoms). In this paper, we introduce and investigate an unrestricted version of the finite factorization property, extending the work on unrestricted UFDs carried out by Coykendall and Zafrullah who first studied unrestricted. An integral domain is said to have the unrestricted finite factorization (U-FF) property if every atomic element has only finitely many factorizations, or equivalently, if its atomic subring is a finite factorization domain (FFD). We position the property U-FF within the hierarchy of classical finiteness conditions, showing that every IDF domain is U-FF but not conversely, and we analyze its behavior under standard constructions. In particular, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the U-FF property to ascend along $D+M$ extensions, prove that nearly atomic IDF domains are FFDs, and construct an explicit example of an integral domain with the U-FF property whose polynomial ring is not U-FF. These results demonstrate that the U-FF property behaves analogously to the IDF property, while providing a finer interpolation between the IDF and the FF conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, using the techniques developed in \cite{DESTate,DET2023mittagintersectionflat}, that dagger algebras and Tate algebras in the sense of Berkovich in prime characteristic $p &gt; 0$ have intersection flat Frobenius. Equivalently, if $S$ is such a ring, then $S^{1/p}$ is a flat and Mittag-Leffler $S$-module. As a consequence, we deduce that any ideal-adic completion of a reduced ring that is essentially of finite type over a dagger algebra or a Berkovich Tate algebra in prime characteristic has big test elements from tight closure theory.</description>

      <title>Bourbaki degree of pairs of projective surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The logarithmic tangent sheaf associated to an algebraically independent sequence of homogeneous polynomials - defined as the kernel of the associated Jacobian matrix - naturally generalizes the classical logarithmic tangent sheaf of a divisor in a projective space to the case of subvarieties defined by more than one equation. As is the case for divisors, one may investigate the freeness of such sequences, and other weaker notions.
  The present work focuses on sequences of two homogeneous polynomials in four variables. We introduce two positive discrete invariants: the invariant m and the Bourbaki degree of a sequence, inspired by the framework of the Bourbaki degree recently developed for projective plane curves by Jardim-Nejad-Simis. The invariant m plays the role of the Tjurina number of plane projective curves and is bounded by a quadratic relation. We establish results concerning the interplay of minimal degree for syzygies of the Jacobian matrix and the introduced discrete invariants. Our approach uses tools from foliation theory, taking advantage of the fact that the logarithmic sheaf is, up to a twist, the tangent sheaf of a codimension one foliation in projective three-space.
  We provide examples and classification results for pencils of cubics and for pairs of a quadric and a cubic polynomials, relating stability and Chern classes with the discrete invariants introduced, while classifying free and nearly-free cases. In particular, one of the nearly-free examples induces an unstable, non-split tangent sheaf for a codimension one foliation of degree 3, answering, in the negative, a conjecture of Calvo-Andrade, Correa and Jardim from 2018.</description>

      <title>The pairwise distributive law of semilattice congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the congruence lattice of a semilattice satsifies a form of distributivity relative to principal congruences of the form $ \Theta_{t \odot s, s}$. Particularly, we establish that semilattice congruences obey the ``pairwise distributive law": \[ (\cap_{i \in w} \Omega_{i}) \vee \Theta_{t \odot s, s} = \cap_{k,r \in w} \big( (\Omega_{k} \cap \Omega_{r}) \vee \Theta_{t \odot s, s} \big) \] for any family of congruences $\{ \Omega_{i} : i\in w \}$, with $w$ a possibly infinite set.</description>

      <title>Lie Algebra Decomposition Classes for Reductive Algebraic Groups in Arbitrary Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decomposition classes provide a way of partitioning the Lie algebras of an algebraic group into equivalence classes based on the Jordan decomposition. In this paper, we investigate the decomposition classes of the Lie algebras of connected reductive algebraic groups, over algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic. We extend some results previously proved under restrictions on the characteristic, and introduce Levi-type decomposition classes to account for some of the difficulties encountered in bad characteristic. We also establish properties of Lusztig-Spaltenstein induction of non-nilpotent orbits, extending the known results for nilpotent orbits.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the splitting problem for finitely generated projective modules $P$ over affine algebras over algebraically closed fields and their polynomial extensions. We then address an open question due to M. Roitman on monic inversion principle for projective modules and prove it in the affirmative for finitely generated rings. For affine algebras over $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$, we prove a monic inversion principle for ideals. We also exhibit some applications.</description>

Abstract: We define the universal exponential extension of an algebraically closed differential field and investigate its properties in the presence of a nice valuation and in connection with linear differential equations. Next we prove normalization theorems for algebraic differential equations over $H$-fields, as a tool in solving such equations in suitable extensions. The results in this monograph are essential in our work on Hardy fields in [6].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coefficient algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra on a finite-dimensional representation is defined as the subalgebra generated by all coefficients of the corresponding characteristic polynomial. We explore connections between classical invariant theory and the coefficient algebras of finite-dimensional complex Lie algebras on some representations. Specifically, we prove that with respect to any symmetric power of the standard representation: (a) the coefficient algebra of the upper triangular solvable complex Lie algebra is isomorphic to the ring of symmetric polynomials; (b) the coefficient algebra of the general linear complex Lie algebra is isomorphic to the invariant ring of the general linear group with the conjugacy action on the full space of matrices; and (c) the coefficient algebra of the special linear complex Lie algebra can be generated by classical trace functions. As an application, we determine the characteristic polynomial of the special linear complex Lie algebra on its standard representation.</description>

      <title>Skein and cluster algebras of punctured surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the full Fock--Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,\Sigma_{g,p}}$, the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety of the moduli of decorated twisted $SL_2$-local systems on triangulable surfaces $\Sigma_{g,p}$ with at least 2 punctures. Equivalently, we show that the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$, or the middle cluster algebra $\mathrm{mid}(\mathcal{A})$, coincides with the upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$. Inspired by the work of Shen--Sun--Weng, we introduce the localized cluster variety $\mathring{\mathcal{A}}$ as the algebraic version of the decorated Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$. We show its global section $\Gamma(\mathring{\mathcal{A}},\mathcal{O}_{\mathring{\mathcal{A}}})$ equals the classical Roger-Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, providing a quantization of $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$ in terms of the Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_q(\Sigma)$. As a consequence of our geometric characterizations, we deduce normality and the Gorenstein property of the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$ and the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, as well as finite generation of upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$.</description>

      <title>On Shilov boundaries, Rees valuations and integral extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore an analogy between, on one hand, the notions of integral closure of ideals and Rees valuations in commutative algebra and, on the other hand, the notions of spectral seminorm and Shilov boundary in nonarchimedean geometry. For any Tate ring $\mathcal{A}$ with a Noetherian ring of definition $\mathcal{A}_{0}$ and pseudo-uniformizer $\varpi\in\mathcal{A}_{0}$, we prove that the Shilov boundary for $\mathcal{A}$ naturally coincides with the set of Rees valuation rings of the principal ideal $(\varpi)_{\mathcal{A}_{0}}$ of $\mathcal{A}_{0}$.
  Furthermore, we characterize the Shilov boundary for a wide class of Tate rings by means of minimal open prime ideals in the subring of power-bounded elements. For affinoid algebras, in the sense of Tate, whose underlying rings are integral domains, this recovers a well-known result of Berkovich. Moreover, under some mild assumptions, we prove stability of our characterization of the Shilov boundary under (completed) integral extensions. In particular, for every mixed-characteristic Noetherian domain $R$, we obtain a description of the Shilov boundary for the Tate ring $\widehat{R^{+}}[p^{-1}]$, where $\widehat{R^{+}}$ is the $p$-adic completion of the absolute integral closure of the domain $R$.</description>

      <title>The Graded Betti Numbers of the Skeletons of Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class $\mathcal{C}$ of squarefree monomial ideals $I\subseteq R=\mathbb{K}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ over a field $\mathbb{K}$, defined by the condition that $\dim R/I$ equals the maximum degree of the minimal generators of $I$ minus one. We show that the Stanley-Reisner ideal of every $i$-skeleton of a simplicial complex $\Delta$ belongs to $\mathcal{C}$ for all $-1\le i&lt;\dim\Delta$. To investigate their homological properties, we introduce the notion of a degree resolution and prove that every ideal in $\mathcal{C}$ possesses this property. Moreover, we show that every squarefree monomial ideal admits a truncation whose regularity coincides with that of the original ideal, thereby reducing the study of degree resolutions to that of linear resolutions. Finally, we provide an explicit formula describing the relationship between the graded Betti numbers of a simplicial complex and those of its skeletons.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and investigate the open neighborhood ideal $\mathcal{N}(G)$ of a finite simple graph $G$. We describe the minimal primary decomposition of $\mathcal{N}(G)$ in terms of the minimal total dominating sets (TD-sets) of $G$. Then we prove that the open neighborhood ideal of a tree is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if the tree is unmixed (well totally dominated) and calculate the Cohen-Macaulay type. We also give a descriptive characterization of all unmixed trees which takes polynomial time to verify.</description>

      <title>Initially Cohen-Macaulay Modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce initially Cohen-Macaulay modules over a commutative Noetherian local ring $R$, a new class of $R$-modules that generalizes both Cohen-Macaulay and sequentially Cohen-Macaulay modules. A finitely generated $R$-module $N$ is initially Cohen-Macaulay if its depth is equal to its initial dimension, an invariant defined as the infimum of the coheights of the associated primes of $N$. We develop the theory of these modules, providing homological, combinatorial, and topological characterizations and confirming their compatibility with regular sequences, localization, and dimension filtrations. When this theory is applied to simplicial complexes, we establish analogues of Reisner's criterion, the Eagon-Reiner theorem, and Duval's characterization of sequentially Cohen-Macaulay complexes. Finally, we classify certain classes of initially Cohen-Macaulay graphs of interest and those whose projective dimension coincides with their maximum vertex degree.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the work of Soma and Watari, we define a tree structure on certain subsemimodules of the semigroup $\Gamma$ associated with an irreducible plane curve singularity $(C,O)$. Building on results of Oblomkov, Rasmussen, and Shende, we show that for specific classes of singularities, this tree encodes key aspects of the geometry of the punctual Hilbert schemes of $(C,O)$. As an application, we compute the motivic Hilbert zeta function for a family of singular curves. \vskip 0.1cm A point in the Hilbert scheme corresponds to an ideal in the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{C,O}$ of the singularity. We study the stratification of these Hilbert schemes induced by constraints on the minimal number of generators of the defining ideals, and we describe geometric properties of these strata, including their dimension and closure relations.\vskip 0.1cm More importantly, we study their motivic zeta functions, particularly the motivic Hilbert zeta function, which encodes the classes of all punctual Hilbert schemes in the Grothendieck ring of varieties.</description>
