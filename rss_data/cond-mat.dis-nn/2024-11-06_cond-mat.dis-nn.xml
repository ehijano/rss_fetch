      <title>On the shape of Gaussian scale-free polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the model of complex hyperbranched polymer structures formed on the basis of scale-free graphs, where functionalities (degrees) $k$ of nodes obey a power law decaying probability $p(k)\sim{k^{-\alpha}}$. Such polymer topologies can be considered as generalization of regular hierarchical dendrimer structures with fixed functionalities. The conformational size and shape characteristics, such as averaged asphericity $\langle A_3 \rangle$ and size ratio $g$ of such polymer networks are obtained numerically by application of Wei's method, which defines the configurations of any complex Gaussian network in terms of eigenvalue spectra of corresponding Kirchhoff matrix. Our quantitative results indicate, in particular, an increase of compactness and symmetry of network structures with the decrease of parameter $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement structures in quantum stabilizer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for visualizing the internal structure of multipartite entanglement in pure stabilizer states. Our algorithm graphically organizes the many-body correlations in a hierarchical structure. This provides a rich taxonomy from which one can extract a number of traditional quantities such as entanglement depth and entanglement entropy. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (GHZ state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Discrete Modern Hopfield Networks in Open Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern Hopfield network, proposed by Krotov and Hopfield, is a mathematical generalization of the Hopfield network, which is a basic model of associative memory that employs higher-order interactions. This study introduces an open quantum model for discrete modern Hopfield networks that generalizes the open quantum Hopfield network. Our model integrates dissipative quantum spin systems, governed by quantum master equations, with classical hopping terms and additional quantum effects through a transverse field. We analytically examined the behavior of the stable fixed points and numerically determined the phase diagram. The results demonstrated qualitatively distinct behaviors from the open quantum Hopfield network, showing that the ferromagnetic and limit cycle phases have additional stable fixed points.</description>

      <title>Unified percolation scenario for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ processes in simple glass formers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. This paper investigates numerically a percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses. For nine binary glass formers we find that, as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the $\alpha$ process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass, mobile-particle percolation pinpoints a Johari-Goldstein $\beta$ relaxation whenever it is well separated from the $\alpha$ process. For 2D systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no $\beta$ relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest a general description of glassy dynamics based on a percolation perspective.</description>

      <title>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jammed structures with finite shear modulus emerge from polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings. To link these macroscopic mechanical properties with microstructural characteristics, we examine the vibrational behavior of two-dimensional polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse systems using discrete element method simulations. The vibrational density of states (DOS) reflects structural disorder and soft modes, and we analyze this for both types of packings as they approach jamming and unjamming densities. Our results reveal that the low-frequency plateau in the DOS, observed in both polycrystalline and disordered packings, originates from nonaffine particle displacements, particularly those involving "rattlers", which are prominent near jamming and unjamming states. Although the jamming and unjamming process is irreversible, we find no evidence of expected history dependence in the DOS across any of the systems studied.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations in the synchronization dynamics of limit-cycle oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent process whereby one-dimensional systems of self-sustained oscillators synchronize is shown to display scale invariance in space and time, akin to that found in the dynamics of equilibrium critical phenomena. Remarkably, the process is largely independent of system details, sharing with a class of nonequilibrium surface kinetic roughening the universal scaling behavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with columnar noise, and featuring phase fluctuations that follow a Tracy-Widom probability distribution. This is revealed by a numerical exploration of rings of Stuart-Landau oscillators (the universal representation of an oscillating system close to a Hopf bifurcation) and rings of van der Pol oscillators, both paradigmatically supporting self-sustained oscillations. The critical behavior is very well defined for limit-cycle oscillations near bifurcation, and still dominates comparatively far from it. In particular, the Tracy-Widom fluctuation distribution seems to be an extremely robust feature of the synchronization process. The nonequilibrium criticality here described appears to transcend the details of the coupled dynamical systems that synchronize, making plausible its experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Bringing together two paradigms of non-equilibrium: Fragile versus robust aging in driven glassy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are two key paradigms for non-equilibrium dynamics: on the one hand, aging towards an equilibrium state that cannot be reached on reasonable timescales; on the other, external driving that can lead to non-equilibrium steady states. We explore how these two mechanisms interact, by studying the behaviour of trap models, which are paradigmatic descriptions of slow glassy dynamics, when driven by trajectory bias towards high or low activity. To diagnose whether the driven systems continue to age, we establish a framework for mapping the biased dynamics to a Markovian time evolution with time-dependent transition rates. We find that the original aging dynamics reacts in two qualitatively distinct ways to the driving: it can be destroyed by driving of any nonzero strength (fragile aging), whereby the dynamics either reaches an active steady state or effectively freezes; or it can persist within a finite range of driving strengths around the undriven case (robust aging). This classification into fragile and robust aging could form the basis for distinguishing different universality classes of aging dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free deterministic equivalents and scaling laws for random feature regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the generalization performance of random feature ridge regression (RFRR). Our main contribution is a general deterministic equivalent for the test error of RFRR. Specifically, under a certain concentration property, we show that the test error is well approximated by a closed-form expression that only depends on the feature map eigenvalues. Notably, our approximation guarantee is non-asymptotic, multiplicative, and independent of the feature map dimension -- allowing for infinite-dimensional features. We expect this deterministic equivalent to hold broadly beyond our theoretical analysis, and we empirically validate its predictions on various real and synthetic datasets. As an application, we derive sharp excess error rates under standard power-law assumptions of the spectrum and target decay. In particular, we provide a tight result for the smallest number of features achieving optimal minimax error rate.</description>
