      <title>Likelihood-free inference of phylogenetic tree posterior distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic inference, the task of reconstructing how related sequences evolved from common ancestors, is a central task in evolutionary genomics. The current state-of-the-art methods exploit probabilistic models of sequence evolution along phylogenetic trees, by searching for the tree maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences, or by estimating the posterior of the tree given the sequences in a Bayesian framework. Both approaches typically require to compute likelihoods, which is only feasible under simplifying assumptions such as independence of the evolution at the different positions of the sequence, and even then remains a costly operation. Here we present Phyloformer 2, the first likelihood-free inference method for posterior distributions over phylogenies. Phyloformer 2 exploits a novel encoding for pairs of sequences that makes it more scalable than previous approaches, and a parameterized probability distribution factorized over a succession of subtree merges. The resulting network provides accurate estimates of the posterior distribution, and outperforms both state-of-the-art maximum likelihood methods and a previous likelihood-free method for point estimation. It opens the way to fast and accurate phylogenetic inference under realistic models of sequence evolution.</description>

      <title>Using transient encounter rates to quantify spatial patterns of home-range organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encounters between individuals underlie key ecological processes such as predation, mating, and disease transmission, making encounter rates a direct link between individual movement behavior and population-level outcomes. We investigate how two common features of animal movement--directional persistence and range residency--jointly shape encounter rates. Using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with foraging (OUF) model, which integrates these two properties of animal movement, we derive exact analytical expressions for encounter rates and show that, for range-resident animals, the effect of persistence depends strongly on the degree of home-range overlap. Based on this theoretical result, we then introduce a new encounter-based metric that quantifies the spatial organization of home ranges at scales relevant to animal encounters. We finally apply this metric to movement data from lowland tapirs ($\textit{Tapirus terrestris}$) in Brazil's Pantanal region and find a significant level of home-range spatial segregation, consistent with the solitary behavior of this species.</description>

      <title>Power-laws in phylogenetic trees and the preferential coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among species and reflect the forces that shaped them. While many studies rely on branch length information, the topology of phylogenetic trees (particularly their degree of imbalance) offers a robust framework for inferring evolutionary dynamics when timing data is uncertain. Classical metrics, such as the Colless and Sackin indices, quantify tree imbalance and have been extensively used to characterize phylogenies. Empirical phylogenies typically show intermediate imbalance, falling between perfectly balanced and highly skewed trees. This regime is marked by a power-law relationship between subtree sizes and their cumulative sizes, governed by a characteristic exponent. Although a recent niche-size model replicates this scaling, its mathematical origin and the exponent's value remain unclear. We present a generative model inspired by Kingman's coalescent that incorporates niche-like dynamics through preferential node coalescence. This process maps to Smoluchowski's coagulation kinetics and is described by a generalized Smoluchowski equation. Our model produces imbalanced trees with power-law exponents matching empirical and numerical observations, revealing the mathematical basis of observed scaling laws and offering new tools to interpret tree imbalance in evolutionary contexts.</description>

      <title>Modeling Adoptive Cell Therapy in Bladder Cancer from Sparse Biological Data using PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).</description>

      <title>Branch length statistics in phylogenetic trees under constant-rate birth-death dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees represent the evolutionary relationships between extant lineages, where extinct or non-sampled lineages are omitted. Extending the work of Stadler and collaborators, this paper focuses on the branch lengths in phylogenetic trees arising under a constant-rate birth-death model. We derive branch length distributions of phylogenetic branches with and without random sampling of individuals of the extant population under two distinct statistical scenarios: a fixed age of the birth-death process and a fixed number of individuals at the time of observation. We find that branches connected to the tree leaves (pendant branches) and branches in the interior of the tree behave very differently under sampling; pendant branches grow longer without limit as the sampling probability is decreased, whereas the interior branch lengths quickly reach an asymptotic distribution that does not depend on the sampling probability.</description>
