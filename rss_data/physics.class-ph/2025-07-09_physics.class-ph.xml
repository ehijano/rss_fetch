      <title>Revisiting Multi-Wave Resonance in Classical Lattices: Quasi-Resonances, Not Exact Resonance, Govern Energy Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-wave exact resonance condition is a fundamental principle for understanding energy transfer in condensed matter systems, yet the dynamical evolution of waves satisfying this condition remains unexplored. Here, we reveal that the multi-wave resonant kinetic equations possess distinctive symmetry properties that preferentially induce energy equalization between counter-propagating waves of identical frequency. This initial equalization disrupts the exact resonance condition, rendering it dynamically invalid. We further demonstrate that nonlinearity-mediated multi-wave quasi-resonances--not exact resonances--overn energy transfer and drive the system toward thermalization. Crucially, the strength of exact resonances decays with increasing system size, while quasi-resonance strength grows. Moreover, exact resonance strength remains independent of nonlinearity, whereas quasi-resonance strength diminishes with reduced nonlinearity. These observations provide additional evidence supporting the aforementioned conclusion while elucidating the size-dependent thermalization characteristics in lattice systems.</description>

      <title>On the Natural Equivalence Between Canonical and Hilbert Energy Momentum Tensors via Noether's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the structure and properties of the canonical energy momentum tensor (EMT) across a range of field theories. We begin by developing a unified and systematic method that naturally yields the canonical EMT for gauge theory, without the need for artificial symmetrization or improvement terms. Our analysis highlights how Noether's theorem intrinsically emphasizes the 1-form nature of gauge potentials. We further extend to general relativity and demonstrate that the assumption of metric compatibility naturally implies a torsion free connection. Building upon variational symmetry principles, we establish the equivalence between the Einstein Hilbert EMT and the canonical EMT, thereby clarifying their respective roles in field dynamics and conservation laws. Lastly, we present an alternative derivation of the Einstein field equations via Noether's theorem.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Boundary Conditions for Space--time Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a general family of electromagnetic boundary conditions applicable to arbitrary space--time interfaces between electromagnetic media, which include the known space--only and time--only boundary conditions as special cases. These boundary conditions describe a broad class of electromagnetic interfaces, including surfaces in arbitrary motion, ultra-thin (metasurface) media, and cases where the media on one or both sides of the boundary can be both spatially and temporally dispersive. Our approach utilizes 4-dimensional spacetime and addresses the question of how, and in what ways, an electromagnetic field may be connected across a 3-dimensional hypersurface.
  We show that our proposed boundary conditions are the most general conditions consistent with causality and linearity.</description>
