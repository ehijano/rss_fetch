      <title>About carrier's self-trapping and dynamical Rashba splitting in the two-dimensional hybrid perovskite (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy is employed to monitor photoexcited electrons in the two-dimensional (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$. ARPES intensity maps are in good agreement with ab-initio calculations of the band structure. The effective mass is $-0.18 \pm 0.02 m_e$ and $0.12 \pm 0.02 m_e$ for holes and electrons, respectively. In the photoexcited state, spin-orbit splitting of the conduction band cannot be resolved. This sets the upper bound of photoinduced Rashba coupling to $\alpha_C&lt;2.5$ eV\AA. The correlated electron-hole plasma evolves in Wannier excitons with Bohr radius of 2.5 nm, while no sign of self-trapping in small polarons is found within the investigated time window of up to 120 ps following photoexcitation.</description>

      <title>Dopant site occupancy determined by core-loss-filtered, position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the elastic scattering regime, probe position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns have proven robust for estimating specimen thickness and mistilt. Through simulation, we show that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of a small concentration of dopants in an otherwise known crystal structure. By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, we interpret core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy traditionally used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We show that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but that this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors.</description>

      <title>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Large Thermal Hall Effect in MnPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the thermal Hall effect can originate from magnons (magnon Hall effect), phonons (phonon Hall effect), or their combination (magnon-polaron Hall effect). The magnon-polaron Hall effect, first observed in Fe2Mo3O8, is particularly intriguing as its thermal Hall signal can be remarkably large. In this study, we explore the thermal Hall effect in MnPS3, an insulating antiferromagnetic material exhibiting a spin-flop transition and significant magnetoelastic coupling, making it a strong candidate for studying the thermal Hall effect originating from spin-lattice coupling. We report an exceptionally large thermal Hall angle down to 4 K and show that it cannot be accounted for by standard calculations based on the intrinsic magnon-polaron Berry curvature. Our findings provide an in-depth analysis of the role of the spin-flop transition in the thermal properties of MnPS3 and call for further theory development on magnon-phonon coupling and scattering to reveal their influence on transverse heat transport.</description>

      <title>Broken inversion symmetry in the charge density wave phase in EuAl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: EuAl$_4$ exhibits a complex phase diagram, including the development of a charge density wave (CDW) below $T_{CDW} = 145$ K. Below $T_{N}=15.4$ K, a series of antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered phases appear, while non-trivial topological phases, like skyrmion lattices, are stabilized under an applied magnetic field. The symmetries of the variously ordered phases are a major issue concerning the understanding of the stabilization of the ordered phases as well as concerning the interplay between the various types of order. EuAl$_4$ at room temperature has tetragonal symmetry with space group $I4/mmm$. The CDW phase has an incommensurately modulated crystal structure described by the modulation wave vector $\mathbf{q} \approx 0.17\mathbf{c}^{*}$. On the basis of various experiments, including elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering, and second-harmonic generation, it has been proposed that the symmetry of the CDW phase of EuAl$_4$ could be centrosymmetric orthorhombic, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic or non-centrosymmetric tetragonal. Here, we report temperature-dependent, single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments that show that the CDW is a transverse CDW with phason disorder, and with non-centrosymmetric symmetry according to the orthorhombic superspace group $F222(0\,0\,\sigma)00s$.Essential for this finding is the availability of a sufficient number of second-order ($2\mathbf{q}$) satellite reflections in the x-ray diffraction data set. The broken inversion symmetry implies that skyrmions might form due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, instead of a more exotic mechanism as it is required for centrosymmetric structures.</description>

      <title>Gigantic Harmonic Generation in N\'eel-Torque Antiferromagnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the resonant and higher-harmonic magnetic responses of a collinear antiferromagnet induced by N\'eel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the sub-terahertz frequency range. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role of the NSOTs in nonlinear dynamics.</description>
