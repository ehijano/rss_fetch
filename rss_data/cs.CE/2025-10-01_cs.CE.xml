      <title>Multi-patch isogeometric neural solver for partial differential equations on computer-aided design domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a computational framework that combines physics-informed neural networks with multi-patch isogeometric analysis to solve partial differential equations on complex computer-aided design geometries. The method utilizes patch-local neural networks that operate on the reference domain of isogeometric analysis. A custom output layer enables the strong imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions. Solution conformity across interfaces between non-uniform rational B-spline patches is enforced using dedicated interface neural networks. Training is performed using the variational framework by minimizing the energy functional derived after the weak form of the partial differential equation. The effectiveness of the suggested method is demonstrated on two highly non-trivial and practically relevant use-cases, namely, a 2D magnetostatics model of a quadrupole magnet and a 3D nonlinear solid and contact mechanics model of a mechanical holder. The results show excellent agreement to reference solutions obtained with high-fidelity finite element solvers, thus highlighting the potential of the suggested neural solver to tackle complex engineering problems given the corresponding computer-aided design models.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation under Stochastic Demands using Shrinking Horizon Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally allocating a limited number of resources across time to maximize revenue under stochastic demands. This formulation is relevant in various areas of control, such as supply chain, ticket revenue maximization, healthcare operations, and energy allocation in power grids. We propose a bisection method to solve the static optimization problem and extend our approach to a shrinking horizon algorithm for the sequential problem. The shrinking horizon algorithm computes future allocations after updating the distribution of future demands by conditioning on the observed values of demand. We illustrate the method on a simple synthetic example with jointly log-normal demands, showing that it achieves performance close to a bound obtained by solving the prescient problem.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification of tumor growth modeled by a parametric semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the application of a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method to a class of semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion partial differential equations used to model tumor growth. Mathematical models of tumor growth are largely phenomenological in nature, capturing infiltration of the tumor into surrounding healthy tissue, proliferation of the existing tumor, and patient response to therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considerable inter-patient variability, inherent heterogeneity of the disease, sparse and noisy data collection, and model inadequacy all contribute to significant uncertainty in the model parameters. It is crucial that these uncertainties can be efficiently propagated through the model to compute quantities of interest (QoIs), which in turn may be used to inform clinical decisions. We show that QMC methods can be successful in computing expectations of meaningful QoIs. Well-posedness results are developed for the model and used to show a theoretical error bound for the case of uniform random fields. The theoretical linear error rate, which is superior to that of standard Monte Carlo, is verified numerically. Encouraging computational results are also provided for lognormal random fields, prompting further theoretical development.</description>

      <title>Better with Less: Small Proprietary Models Surpass Large Language Models in Financial Transaction Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type, we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage. This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than \$13 million annual cost.</description>

      <title>UncertainGen: Uncertainty-Aware Representations of DNA Sequences for Metagenomic Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach, UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for large-scale metagenomic analysis.</description>

      <title>Bubble, Bubble, AI's Rumble: Why Global Financial Regulatory Incident Reporting is Our Shield Against Systemic Stumbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble." As Shakespeare's witches foretold chaos through cryptic prophecies, modern capital markets grapple with systemic risks concealed by opaque AI systems. According to IMF, the August 5, 2024, plunge in Japanese and U.S. equities can be linked to algorithmic trading yet ab-sent from existing AI incidents database exemplifies this transparency crisis. Current AI incident databases, reliant on crowdsourcing or news scraping, systematically over-look capital market anomalies, particularly in algorithmic and high-frequency trading. We address this critical gap by proposing a regulatory-grade global database that elegantly synthesises post-trade reporting frameworks with proven incident documentation models from healthcare and aviation. Our framework's temporal data omission technique masking timestamps while preserving percent-age-based metrics enables sophisticated cross-jurisdictional analysis of emerging risks while safeguarding confidential business information. Synthetic data validation (modelled after real life published incidents , sentiments, data) reveals compelling pat-terns: systemic risks transcending geographical boundaries, market manipulation clusters distinctly identifiable via K-means algorithms, and AI system typology exerting significantly greater influence on trading behaviour than geographical location, This tripartite solution empowers regulators with unprecedented cross-jurisdictional oversight, financial institutions with seamless compliance integration, and investors with critical visibility into previously obscured AI-driven vulnerabilities. We call for immediate action to strengthen risk management and foster resilience in AI-driven financial markets against the volatile "cauldron" of AI-driven systemic risks., promoting global financial stability through enhanced transparency and coordinated oversight.</description>

      <title>Analyzing BEV Suitability and Charging Strategies Using Italian Driving Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are rapidly evolving from a niche alternative to an established option for private transportation, often replacing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Despite growing interest, significant barriers remain, including range anxiety, the inconvenience associated with public charging stations, and higher costs. This study analyses extensive telemetry data collected from 10,441 users using ICE vehicles in an Italian province to assess the potential for switching to BEVs without changing current travel behaviour. We evaluate to what extent the BEV models can fulfil their mobility needs under different charging scenarios. To do so, we replicate trips and parking events, simulating and monitoring the battery state of charge. The analysis reveals the compromises between charging behaviours and limited BEV autonomy. Assuming access to overnight charging, at least 35% of the users could already adopt even low-capacity BEVs.</description>

      <title>Importance of localized dilatation and distensibility in identifying determinants of thoracic aortic aneurysm with neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Finetuning Large Language Model as an Effective Symbolic Regressor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deriving governing equations from observational data, known as Symbolic Regression (SR), is a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Large Language Models, (LLMs) have shown promise in this task by leveraging their vast cross-disciplinary scientific knowledge. However, existing LLM-based methods primarily rely on direct inference or prompt engineering, often requiring excessive inference iterations to converge on correct formulas or failing to treat complex equation targets. These limitations in effectiveness and generalization stem from an inherent tension between pre-trained LLMs' proficiency in approximate reasoning and the high-precision demands of SR tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose to fine-tune LLMs for enhanced SR capability. Yet, the absence of dedicated datasets for SR-oriented fine-tuning remains a critical barrier. We thus introduce SymbArena, specifically engineered to optimize LLMs for SR. This benchmark comprises over 148,000 diverse equations formulated as corpora of 1.83 billion tokens for LLM utilization, enabling effective training and inference. Further, to ensure a more comprehensive and fair evaluation, SymbArena proposes a heuristics metric to precisely quantify form-level consistency, going beyond existing SR numerical-oriented evaluation strategies. With this benchmark, we explore mainstream LLM fine-tuning techniques for SR tasks and establish Symbolic-R1, a simple yet effective LLM-based SR strong baseline. Experimental results validate Symbolic-R1 as the first LLM to exceed traditional numerical methods in both numerical precision and symbolic form accuracy, outperforming the second-best LLM baseline with improvements of 2-fold gains in R2 score and 10.3% in form-level consistency score.</description>

      <title>Comparison of nested geometry treatments within GPU-based Monte Carlo neutron transport simulations of fission reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) neutron transport provides detailed estimates of radiological quantities within fission reactors. This involves tracking individual neutrons through a computational geometry. CPU-based MC codes use multiple polymorphic tracker types with different tracking algorithms to exploit the repeated configurations of reactors, but virtual function calls have high overhead on the GPU. The Shift MC code was modified to support GPU-based tracking with three strategies: dynamic polymorphism with virtual functions, static polymorphism, and a single tracker type with tree-based acceleration. On the Frontier supercomputer these methods achieve 77.8%, 91.2%, and 83.4%, respectively, of the tracking rate obtained using a specialized tracker optimized for rectilinear-grid-based reactors. This indicates that all three methods are suitable for typical reactor problems in which tracking does not dominate runtime. The flexibility of the single tracker method is highlighted with a hexagonal-grid microreactor problem, performed without hexagonal-grid-specific tracking routines, providing a 2.19$\times$ speedup over CPU execution.</description>

      <title>KANO: Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics (variable coefficient PDEs) for any physical input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.</description>
