      <title>Trajectory arclength reveals chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that the phase space arclength of a trajectory, quantified by the time-averaged Lagrangian descriptor, is a robust and self-contained chaos indicator. By invoking Birkhoff's Ergodic Partition Theorem, we show that this scalar function distinguishes dynamical regimes via its power spectral density: for regular motion it converges to a delta function, whereas for chaotic trajectories the spectrum exhibits an inverse power-law $(1/\omega)$ driven by the phenomenon of dynamical stickiness. With this approach, we avoid the computation and simulation of the variational equations and the usage of neighboring orbits, making it the simplest geometrical chaos indicator derivable from Lagrangian descriptors. Its computational efficiency enables the study of high-dimensional systems and allows the generation of large datasets of classified initial conditions, ideal for training Machine Learning models. We validate these findings using the H\'enon-Heiles and the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam systems. By linking the geometrical properties of phase space to spectral analysis, this work provides the mathematical justification to establish Lagrangian descriptors as a rigorous, self-sufficient framework for the global analysis of chaos and regularity in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Parrondo's paradox: An overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parrondo's paradox (PP) is a fundamental principle in nonlinear science where the alternation of individually losing strategies leads to a winning outcome. In this topical review, we provide the first systematic panorama of the synergy between PP and chaos. We observe a bidirectional connection between the two areas. The first direction is the translation of PP into the interplay between Order and Chaos through either Chaos + Chaos $\to$ Order (CCO) or Order + Order $\to$ Chaos (OOC). In this vein, many quantifiers, such as Lyapunov Exponents, $\lambda$, and entropic measures, are used. Second, we note that chaos can be used to engineer switching protocols that can lead to nontrivial effects in diverse PP cases. Our review clarifies the universality of PP and highlights its robust theoretical and practical applications across several areas of science and technology. Finally, we delineate key open questions, emphasizing the unresolved theoretical limits, the role of high-dimensional maps and continuous flows, and the critical need for more experimental verification of the dynamic PP in chaotic systems. For completeness, we also provide a full Python code that allows the reader to observe the many facets of the PP.</description>

      <title>Chaos, the Critical Phenomenon in Phase Space: Feigenbaum Constants and Critical Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaos in both dissipative systems and conservative systems is investigated on the approach of renormalization group. It is found that the chaos is regarded as the critical phenomenon of equilibrium statistics in phase space. The two Feigenbaum constants in the period-doubling bifurcation systems correspond to two independent critical exponents, which are universal and can be adopted to distinguish the classes of chaos. For the conservative systems, due to the critical nature of the chaos, the isolated systems with different parameters are correlated in the phase space, and therefore the isolated system is no longer isolated in the phase space. The information of conservative systems is irreversibly lost over time, which leads to the increase entropy in an isolated system, and the contradiction between the second law of thermodynamics and the reversibility of isolated systems can be resolved.</description>

      <title>Linear Response and Optimal Fingerprinting for Nonautonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a link between response theory, pullback measures, and optimal fingerprinting method that paves the way for a) predicting the impact of acting forcings on time-dependent systems and b) attributing observed anomalies to acting forcings when the reference state in not time-independent. We first derive formulas for linear response theory for time-dependent Markov chains and diffusions processes. We discuss existence, uniqueness, and differentiability of the pullback measure under general (not necessarily slow or periodic) perturbations of the transition kernels. An explicit Green-Kubo-type formula for the linear response is derived. We analyze in detail the case of periodic reference dynamics, where the unperturbed pullback attractor is periodic but the response is generally not. Our formulas reduce to those of classic linear response if one considers a reference autonomous state. Finally, we show that our results allow for extending the theory of optimal fingerprinting for detection and attribution of climate change (or change in any complex system) for the case of time-dependent background state and for the case where the optimal solution is sought for multiple time slices at the same time. We provide strong numerical support for the findings by applying our theory to a modified version of the Ghil-Sellers energy balance model where we include explicit time dependence in the reference state as a result of natural forcings. We verify the accuracy of response theory in predicting the impact of increases of $CO_2$ in the temperature field even when we discretize the system using Markov state modelling approach. Additionally, we consider a more complex modelling scenario where a localized aerosol forcing is also included in the system and show that the optimal fingerprinting method developed here is able to attribute the climate change signal to the acting forcings.</description>

      <title>Is Flow Matching Just Trajectory Replay for Sequential Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching (FM) is increasingly used for time-series generation, but it is not well understood whether it learns a general dynamical structure or simply performs an effective "trajectory replay". We study this question by deriving the velocity field targeted by the empirical FM objective on sequential data, in the limit of perfect function approximation. For the Gaussian conditional paths commonly used in practice, we show that the implied sampler is an ODE whose dynamics constitutes a nonparametric, memory-augmented continuous-time dynamical system. The optimal field admits a closed-form expression as a similarity-weighted mixture of instantaneous velocities induced by past transitions, making the dataset dependence explicit and interpretable. This perspective positions neural FM models trained by stochastic optimization as parametric surrogates of an ideal nonparametric solution. Using the structure of the optimal field, we study sampling and approximation schemes that improve the efficiency and numerical robustness of ODE-based generation. On nonlinear dynamical system benchmarks, the resulting closed-form sampler yields strong probabilistic forecasts directly from historical transitions, without training.</description>

      <title>The stability of boundary equilibria of three-dimensional Filippov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For three-dimensional piecewise-smooth systems of ordinary differential equations, this paper characterises the stability of points that belong to a switching surface and are equilibria of exactly one of the two neighbouring pieces of the system. Stability is challenging to characterise when nearby orbits repeatedly switch between regular motion on one side of the switching surface, and sliding motion on the switching surface, as defined via Filippov's convention. We prove that in this case stability is governed by the behaviour of a global reinjection mechanism of a four-parameter family of piecewise-linear hybrid systems, and perform a detailed numerical study of this family.</description>

      <title>DyMixOp: A Neural Operator Designed from a Complex Dynamics Perspective with Local-Global Mixing for Solving PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in recasting these systems into a tractable representation particularly when the dynamics are inherently non-linearizable or require infinite-dimensional spaces for linearization. To address this challenge, we introduce DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework for PDEs that integrates theoretical insights from complex dynamical systems. Grounded in dynamics-aware priors and inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp projects the original infinite-dimensional PDE dynamics onto a finite-dimensional latent space. This reduction preserves both essential linear structures and dominant nonlinear interactions, thereby establishing a physically interpretable and computationally structured foundation. Central to this approach is the local-global mixing (LGM) transformation, a key architectural innovation inspired by the convective nonlinearity in turbulent flows. By multiplicatively coupling local fine-scale features with global spectral information, LGM effectively captures high-frequency details and complex nonlinear couplings while mitigating the spectral bias that plagues many existing neural operators. The framework is further enhanced by a dynamics-informed architecture that stacks multiple LGM layers in a hybrid configuration, incorporating timescale-adaptive gating and parallel aggregation of intermediate dynamics. This design enables robust approximation of general evolutionary dynamics across diverse physical regimes. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark PDE systems spanning 1D to 3D, elliptic to hyperbolic types demonstrate that DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance on six of them, significantly reducing prediction errors (by up to 94.3% in chaotic regimes) while maintaining computational efficiency and strong scalability.</description>

      <title>The Role of Phase and Spatial Modes in Wave-Induced Plasma Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a two-dimensional symplectic map for particle motion at the plasma edge by modeling the electrostatic potential as a superposition of integer spatial harmonics with relative phase shift, then reduce it to a two-wave model to study the transport dependence on the perturbation amplitudes, relative phase, and spatial-mode choice. Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation in Excitable Neuronal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled excitable systems can generate a variety of patterns. In this work, we investigate coupled Chialvo maps in two dimensions under two types of nearest-neighbor couplings. One coupling produces ringlike patterns, while the other produces spirals. The rings expand with increasing coupling, whereas spirals evolve into turbulence and dissipate at stronger coupling. To quantify these patterns, we introduce an analogue of the discriminant of the velocity gradient tensor and examine the persistence of its sign. For ring-type patterns, the persistence decays more slowly than exponentially, often following a power law or stretched exponential. When spiral structures remain intact, persistence saturates asymptotically and can exhibit superposed periodic oscillations, suggesting complex exponents at early times. These behaviors highlight deep connections with the underlying dynamics.</description>
