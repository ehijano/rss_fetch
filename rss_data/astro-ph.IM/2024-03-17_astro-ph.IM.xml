      <title>TRANSLIENT: Detecting Transients Resulting from Point Source Motion or Astrometric Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of moving sources over complicated background is important for several reasons. First is measuring the astrophysical motion of the source. Second is that such motion resulting from atmospheric scintillation, color refraction, or astrophysical reasons is a major source of false alarms for image subtraction methods. We extend the Zackay, Ofek, and Gal-Yam image subtraction formalism to deal with moving sources. The new method, named translient (translational transient) detector, applies hypothesis testing between the hypothesis that the source is stationary and that the source is moving. It can be used to detect source motion or to distinguish between stellar variability and motion. For moving source detection, we show the superiority of translient over the proper image subtraction, using the improvement in the receiver-operating characteristic curve. We show that in the small translation limit, Translient is an optimal detector of point source motion in any direction. Furthermore, it is numerically stable, fast to calculate, and presented in a closed form. Efficient transient detection requires both the proper image subtraction statistics and the translient statistics: when the translient statistic is higher, then the subtraction artifact is likely due to motion. We test our algorithm both on simulated data and on real images obtained by the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST). We demonstrate the ability of translient to distinguish between motion and variability, which has the potential to reduce the number of false alarms in transients detection. We provide the translient implementation in Python and MATLAB.</description>

      <title>Thermal control of long delay lines in a high-resolution astrophotonic spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution astronomical spectroscopy carried out with a photonic Fourier transform spectrograph (FTS) requires long asymmetrical optical delay lines that can be dynamically tuned. For example, to achieve a spectral resolution of R = 30,000, a delay line as long as 1.5 cm would be required. Such delays are inherently prone to phase errors caused by temperature fluctuations. This is due to the relatively large thermo-optic coefficient and long lengths of the waveguides, in this case composed of SiN, resulting in thermally dependent changes to the optical path length. To minimize phase error to the order of 0.05 radians, thermal stability of the order of 0.05{\deg} C is necessary. A thermal control system capable of stability such as this would require a fast thermal response and minimal overshoot/undershoot. With a PID temperature control loop driven by a Peltier cooler and thermistor, we minimized interference fringe phase error to +/- 0.025 radians and achieved temperature stability on the order of 0.05{\deg} C. We present a practical system for precision temperature control of a foundry-fabricated and packaged FTS device on a SiN platform with delay lines ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 cm in length using inexpensive off-the-shelf components, including design details, control loop optimization, and considerations for thermal control of integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Expected performance of the Pyramid wavefront sensor with a laser guide star for 40 m class telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of artificial Laser Guide Stars (LGS) is planned for the new generation of giant segmented mirror telescopes, to extend the sky coverage of their adaptive optics systems. The LGS, being a 3D object at a finite distance will have a large elongation that will affect its use with the Shack-Hartmann (SH) wavefront sensor. In this paper, we compute the expected performance for a Pyramid WaveFront Sensor (PWFS) using a LGS for a 40 m telescope affected by photon noise, and also extend the analysis to a flat 2D object as reference. We developed a new way to discretize the LGS, and a new, faster method of propagating the light for any Fourier Filtering wavefront sensors (FFWFS) when using extended objects. We present the use of a sensitivity model to predict the performance of a closed-loop adaptive optic system. We optimized a point source calibrated interaction matrix to accommodate the signal of an extended object, by means of computing optical gains using a convolutional model. We found that the sensitivity drop, given the size of the extended laser source, is large enough to make the system operate in a low-performance regime given the expected return flux of the LGS. The width of the laser beam, rather than the thickness of the sodium layer was identified as the limiting factor. Even an ideal, flat LGS will have a drop in performance due to the flux of the LGS, and small variations in the return flux will result in large variations in performance. We conclude that knife-edge-like wavefront sensors, such as the PWFS, are not recommended for their use with LGS for a 40 m telescope, as they will operate in a low-performance regime, given the size of the extended object.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach for Mitigating Dark Current Noise and Bad Pixels in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Cameras for Space-based Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a gradual increase in the performance of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. These cameras have gained popularity as a viable alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras in a wide range of applications. One particular application is the CMOS camera installed in small space telescopes. However, the limited power and spatial resources available on satellites present challenges in maintaining ideal observation conditions, including temperature and radiation environment. Consequently, images captured by CMOS cameras are susceptible to issues such as dark current noise and defective pixels. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework for mitigating dark current noise and bad pixels for CMOS cameras. Our approach involves two key steps: pixel clustering and function fitting. During pixel clustering step, we identify and group pixels exhibiting similar dark current noise properties. Subsequently, in the function fitting step, we formulate functions that capture the relationship between dark current and temperature, as dictated by the Arrhenius law. Our framework leverages ground-based test data to establish distinct temperature-dark current relations for pixels within different clusters. The cluster results could then be utilized to estimate the dark current noise level and detect bad pixels from real observational data. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted tests using real observation data obtained from the Yangwang-1 satellite, equipped with a near-ultraviolet telescope and an optical telescope. The results show a considerable improvement in the detection efficiency of space-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>High-speed Readout System of X-ray CMOS Image Sensor for Time Domain Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an FPGA-based high-speed readout system for a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor to observe soft X-ray transients in future satellite missions, such as HiZ-GUNDAM. Our previous research revealed that the CMOS image sensor has low-energy X-ray detection capability (0.4-4 keV) and strong radiation tolerance, which satisfies the requirements of the HiZ-GUNDAM mission. However, CMOS sensors typically have small pixel sizes (e.g., $\sim$10 ${\rm \mu m}$), resulting in large volumes of image data. GSENSE400BSI has 2048$\times$2048 pixels, producing 6 Mbyte per frame. These large volumes of observed raw image data cannot be stored in a satellite bus system with a limited storage size. Therefore, only X-ray photon events must be extracted from the raw image data. Furthermore, the readout time of CMOS image sensors is approximately ten times faster than that of typical X-ray CCDs, requiring faster event extraction on a timescale of $\sim$0.1 s. To address these issues, we have developed an FPGA-based image signal processing system capable of high-speed X-ray event extraction onboard without storing raw image data. The developed compact system enabled mounting on a CubeSat mission, facilitating early in-orbit operation demonstration. Here, we present the design and results of the performance evaluation tests of the proposed FPGA-based readout system. Utilizing X-ray irradiation experiments, the results of the X-ray event extraction with the onboard and offline processing methods were consistent, validating the functionality of the proposed system.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Analysis of S2-Star Dynamics: Extended mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural network (PINN) analysis of the dynamics of S-stars in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center is performed within General Relativity treatment. The aim is to reveal the role of possible extended mass (dark matter) configuration in the dynamics of the S-stars, in addition to the dominating central black hole's mass. The PINN training fails to detect the extended mass perturbation in the observational data for S2 star within the existing data accuracy, and the precession constraint indicates no signature of extended mass up to 0.01% of the central mass inside the apocenter of S2. Neural networks analysis thus confirm its efficiency in the analysis of the S-star dynamics.</description>

      <title>zoomies: A tool to infer stellar age from vertical action in Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from Main Sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties; namely, the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age--vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red giant branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called "zoomies" based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from "zoomies" with ages derived from other techniques for a sample of open clusters and main-sequence stars with asteroseismic age measurements. We also compare dynamical age estimates for stellar samples from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass-independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>The Equilibrium Vapor Pressures of Ammonia and Oxygen Ices at Outer Solar System Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few laboratory studies have investigated the vapor pressures of the volatiles that may be present as ices in the outer solar system; even fewer studies have investigated these species at the temperatures and pressures suitable to the surfaces of icy bodies in the Saturnian and Uranian systems ($\lt$100 K, $\lt10^{-9}$ bar). This study adds to the work of Grundy et al. (2024) in extending the known equilibrium vapor pressures of outer solar system ices through laboratory investigations at very low temperatures. Our experiments with ammonia and oxygen ices provide new thermodynamic models for these species' respective enthalpies of sublimation. We find that ammonia ice, and to a lesser degree oxygen ice, are stable at higher temperatures than extrapolations in previous literature have predicted. Our results show that these ices should be retained over longer periods of time than previous extrapolations would predict, and a greater amount of these solids is required to support observation in exospheres of airless bodies in the outer solar system.</description>

      <title>Detection of ionized hydrogen and oxygen from a very luminous and young galaxy 13.4 billion years ago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has discovered a surprising population of bright galaxies in the very early universe (&lt; 500 Myrs after the Big Bang) that is hard to explain with conventional galaxy formation models and whose physical properties remain to be fully understood. Insight into the internal physics of galaxies is captured best via observations of excited-state atomic transitions of ionized gas, but beyond z~7-9, the brightest spectral signatures are redshifted into the mid-infrared regime, where observations are increasingly more difficult. Here, we present the first detection of a hydrogen recombination line (H{\alpha}) and doubly-ionized oxygen ([OIII]4959,5007{\AA}) at z&gt;10 using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument, MIRI. These detections place the bright galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 at z=12.33+/-0.02, making it the most distant astronomical object with direct spectroscopic detection of these lines and the brightest confirmed object at this epoch. These observations provide key insights into the conditions of this primeval galaxy, which shows hard ionizing conditions rarely seen in the local Universe and likely driven by compact, young (&lt;30 Myr) star formation. Its oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance is close to a tenth of the solar value, indicating a rapid metal enrichment during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. This study confirms the unique conditions of the brightest and most distant galaxies recently discovered by JWST and the huge potential of mid-IR observations to characterize these systems, opening a range of new possibilities in the study of the very early Universe.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for identifying transients suitable for both strong signal-dominated and background-dominated objects. By employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as expectation maximization, we achieve computing time reductions of over $10^4$ on a single CPU compared to conventional brute-force methods. Furthermore, this approach can be readily extended to analyze multiple flares. We illustrate the algorithm's application by fitting the IceCube neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised component separation for the extragalactic submillimeter sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a new approach based on self-supervised deep learning networks originally applied to transparency separation in order to simultaneously extract the components of the extragalactic submillimeter sky, namely the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the cosmic infrared background (CIB), and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. In this proof-of-concept paper, we test our approach on the WebSky extragalactic simulation maps in a range of frequencies from 93 to 545 GHz, and compare with one of the state-of-the-art traditional methods, MILCA, for the case of SZ. We first visually compare the images, and then statistically analyse the full-sky reconstructed high-resolution maps with power spectra. We study the contamination from other components with cross spectra, and particularly emphasise the correlation between the CIB and the SZ effect and compute SZ fluxes around positions of galaxy clusters. The independent networks learn how to reconstruct the different components with less contamination than MILCA. Although this is tested here in an ideal case (without noise, beams, or foregrounds), this method shows significant potential for application in future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO) in combination with the Planck satellite.</description>

      <title>Effect of the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB 221009A) on low energy gamma-ray counts at sea level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A gamma-ray burst, named GRB 221009A, occurred on 9 October 2022 and is the brightest ever observed GRB, whose frequency is now estimated as once in 10,000 years. This GRB was reported to be observed from many space missions, VLF receivers, and ground observations in optical and radio data. Additionally, a strikingly large number of very high energy (VHE) photons associated with this GRB were observed by the gamma-ray and cosmic ray observatory LHAASO. Though gamma rays of cosmic origin usually tend to be absorbed by the atmosphere, the high fluence of this GRB, along with the observation of more than 5000 VHE photons (0.5 to 18 TeV) by LHAASO from the ground, emphasises the need to explore other possible ground observations of this GRB.
  The present paper examines the effect of this GRB using gamma-ray data in a low energy range (0.2-6) MeV obtained using NaI (Tl) detectors located at Tirunelveli (Geographic coordinates: 8.71{\deg}N, 77.76{\deg}E), India. With RA = 288.3{\deg} and Dec = 19.8{\deg}, the exceptionally bright fluence of this GRB was geographically centred on India. We report no significant change in the observations associated with GRB 221009A. We discuss the extent of attenuation of gamma-rays in the atmosphere that could explain the reported observations. Further, we investigate the likelihood of ground observation of gamma-rays ($&lt;$10 MeV) for a much more intense hypothetical GRB, and estimate the parameters, such as distance, fluence, and isotropic energy of such a GRB.</description>

      <title>LimberJack.jl: auto-differentiable methods for angular power spectra analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08306v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LimberJack.jl, a fully auto-differentiable code for cosmological analyses of 2 point auto- and cross-correlation measurements from galaxy clustering, CMB lensing and weak lensing data written in Julia. Using Julia's auto-differentiation ecosystem, LimberJack.jl can obtain gradients for its outputs up to an order of magnitude faster than traditional finite difference methods. This makes LimberJack.jl greatly synergistic with gradient-based sampling methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, capable of efficiently exploring parameter spaces with hundreds of dimensions. We first prove LimberJack.jl's reliability by reanalysing the DES Y1 3$\times$2-point data. We then showcase its capabilities by using a O(100) parameters Gaussian Process to reconstruct the cosmic growth from a combination of DES Y1 galaxy clustering and weak lensing data, eBOSS QSO's, CMB lensing and redshift-space distortions. Our Gaussian process reconstruction of the growth factor is statistically consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM Planck 2018 prediction at all redshifts. Moreover, we show that the addition of RSD data is extremely beneficial to this type of analysis, reducing the uncertainty in the reconstructed growth factor by $20\%$ on average across redshift.

Abstract: Current imaging observations of protoplanetary disks using ALMA primarily focus on the sub-millimeter wavelength, leaving a gap in effective observational approaches for centimeter-sized dust, which is crucial to the issue of planet formation. The forthcoming SKA and ngVLA may rectify this deficiency. In this paper, we employ multi-fluid hydrodynamic numerical simulations and radiative transfer calculations to investigate the potential of SKA1-Mid, ngVLA, and SKA2 for imaging protoplanetary disks at sub-cm/cm wavelengths. We create mock images with ALMA/SKA/ngVLA at multi-wavelengths based on the hydrodynamical simulation output, and test different sensitivity and spatial resolutions. We discover that both SKA and ngVLA will serve as excellent supplements to the existing observational range of ALMA, and their high resolution enables them to image substructures in the disk's inner region ($\sim$ 5 au from the stellar). Our results indicate that SKA and ngVLA can be utilized for more extended monitoring programs in the centimeter waveband. While in the sub-centimeter range, ngVLA possesses the capability to produce high-fidelity images within shorter observation times ($\sim$ 1 hour on source time) than previous research, holding potential for future survey observations. We also discuss for the first time the potential of SKA2 for observing protoplanetary disks at a 0.7 cm wavelength.</description>
