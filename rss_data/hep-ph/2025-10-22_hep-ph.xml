      <title>Interactions of the deuteron with a hadronic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interactions of the deuteron with light mesons during the hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions. We treat the deuteron as a weakly bound state and employ the quasi-free approximation to describe the $d\pi$ interaction. The underlying elementary $N\pi$ amplitudes are described by a hybrid effective model, combining the non-resonant background from chiral perturbation theory with resonant contributions via Breit-Wigner parameterizations. These amplitudes are used to calculate the vacuum and thermally-averaged cross-sections for deuteron dissociation and production, namely, $d + \pi \rightarrow N + N' + \pi$ and the corresponding inverse reaction. We then use these cross sections in a rate equation to estimate the time evolution of the deuteron multiplicity. For the initial conditions we consider two models: the statistical hadronization model and the coalescence model, where the deuteron is treated as a hadronic molecule. Our findings suggest that the final deuteron yield does not retain a memory of its initial production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios for Higgs-mixed scalars at the GeV scale from hadronisation models with conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decay modes of a CP-even scalar boson $\phi$ that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs boson, focusing on the mass range between 2 GeV and $2 m_\tau$. Starting from a higher-order perturbative calculation of the inclusive decays $\phi \to gg$ and $\phi \to s\bar{s}$, we employ a hadronisation model to obtain predictions for individual hadronic final states. Our hadronisation model is based on the Herwig cluster model, but incorporates various conservation laws to determine the allowed final states and their respective weights. The model includes two tunable parameters, which we determine using dispersion relation results at $m_\phi = 2$ GeV, enabling extrapolation to higher masses. Our predictions show that two-particle hadronic final states like $\pi^+ \pi^-$ and $K^+ K^-$ dominate over $\mu^+ \mu^-$ for $m_\phi$ near 2 GeV, suggesting promising targets for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Three decades of FCNC studies in 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos: from $Z^\prime$-dominance to the alignment limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes play a prominent role in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) due to their sensitivity to new physics at the TeV scale. Meson-antimeson transitions and rare meson decays provide stringent constraints on new physics through precision measurements of observables such as mass differences, CP asymmetries, and branching ratios. Extensions of the SM based on the $\text{SU}(3)_C \times \text{SU}(3)_L \times \text{U}(1)_N$ gauge group offer a compelling framework for flavor physics, as FCNC processes emerge inexorably at tree level due to the non-universal transformations of the quark families. Among its various realizations, the version incorporating right-handed neutrinos (331RHN) is the most phenomenologically viable. This review synthesizes three decades of theoretical developments in FCNC phenomenology within the 331RHN model, from early $Z^\prime$-dominated studies to the recent recognition of the decisive role played by the SM-like Higgs boson and the identification of the alignment limit. We demonstrate that viable parameter space spans orders of magnitude, from $m_{Z^\prime} \sim$ a few hundred GeV to $\sim 100$ TeV, depending critically on quark mixing parametrizations and scalar alignment configurations, with significant implications for experimental searches at current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>QINNs: Quantum-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical deep neural networks can learn rich multi-particle correlations in collider data, but their inductive biases are rarely anchored in physics structure. We propose quantum-informed neural networks (QINNs), a general framework that brings quantum information concepts and quantum observables into purely classical models. While the framework is broad, in this paper, we study one concrete realisation that encodes each particle as a qubit and uses the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) as a compact, basis-independent summary of particle correlations. Using jet tagging as a case study, QFIMs act as lightweight embeddings in graph neural networks, increasing model expressivity and plasticity. The QFIM reveals distinct patterns for QCD and hadronic top jets that align with physical expectations. Thus, QINNs offer a practical, interpretable, and scalable route to quantum-informed analyses, that is, tomography, of particle collisions, particularly by enhancing well-established deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Collider Searches for Near-Continuum Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study collider constraints on the near-continuum dark matter model, in which the dark sector consists of a tower of closely spaced states with weak-scale masses coupled to the Standard Model through a $Z$-portal. To capture this structure in a model-agnostic way, we introduce a minimal parameterization that encodes the dominant geometric information with three parameters. Using a custom-built Monte-Carlo tool for near-continuous spectra, we simulate DM-pair production at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and subsequent cascade decays via on/off-shell $Z$ bosons, which yield events with large missing transverse momentum and high jet multiplicity. Recasting the CMS multijet$+H_T^{\rm miss}$ analysis of Run-2 data (35.9 fb$^{-1}$), we derive bounds on the model parameter space. Extrapolating these bounds, we provide High-Luminosity LHC projections (3 ab$^{-1}$). We also project sensitivities for future electron-positron colliders at $\sqrt{s}=365$ GeV and $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV, showing substantial improvements over the HL-LHC. The current LHC sensitivity is beginning to approach the theoretically motivated region of the parameter space, while future colliders will be able to comprehensively test this model.</description>

      <title>Systematic derivation of perturbative unitarity bounds for any models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we provide a simple algorithm, anyPUB, to systematically derive the $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering matrix in the high-energy limit for any kind of models, irrespective of their gauge group or their field representation. After computing the eigenvalues analytically and/or numerically from this matrix, we impose perturbative unitarity bounds on them. We tested our method on various models and validated the results against the literature. Finally, as a concrete application of our approach, we discuss the case of the minimal left-right symmetric model and derive, for the first time, the perturbative unitarity constraints in the Pati-Salam model.</description>

      <title>Solar Reflected Dark Matter under the Influence of Dark Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of dark matter particles within the Sun's hot plasma can lead to acceleration of dark matter, producing a high-energy solar-reflected DM flux detectable in ground-based experiments. In the vector portal model, interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles are mediated by a hidden vector field--referred to as ``dark photon"--which kinetically mixes with the conventional photon through a small mixing angle. Furthermore, the solar plasma generates intense magnetic fields. Due to the photon-dark photon mixing, this simultaneously sources a ``dark magnetic field". For sufficiently low dark photon masses, this dark magnetic field is capable of deflecting dark matter particles traversing the Sun. We found that if the dark magnetic force is sufficiently strong, the dark magnetic field becomes a wall, preventing the dark matter particles from reaching the deep core region, suppressing their reflected flux. This scenario correct the sensitivity of solar-reflected dark matter detection, offering critical insights for ground-based experiments aiming to probe dark matter.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Aspects of $b \to s \bar{\ell}\ell$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavor-changing neutral current decays such as $b \to s \bar{\ell} \ell$ are highly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) and therefore provide sensitive tests for new physics. Persistent tensions between SM predictions and experimental results in branching ratios and angular observables can be explained by a shift of the Wilson coefficient $C_9$ of the effective operator $O_9$ by $\sim 20 \%$ relative to the SM value. This shift could arise from a non-standard short-distance contribution or from an inaccurate description of long-distance dynamics, particularly charm rescattering contributions. We therefore investigate charm rescattering contributions in $B^0 \to K^0 \bar{\ell}\ell$ using a model of fundamental hadronic degrees of freedom inspired by heavy-hadron chiral perturbation theory and improved by appropriate form factors as well as experimental data. Our analysis shows that such effects, with a high degree of fine-tuning, could shift $C_9$ by $\sim 20\%$, at the cost of introducing a more pronounced $q^2$ dependence, whereas experimental data are consistent with a $q^2$-independent shift of $C_9$ with the current experimental uncertainties. In the most natural scenario, we find these effects to be of the order of $\sim 5\%$. Connections with other flavor anomalies further illustrate the strong discovery potential of $b \to s \bar{\ell} \ell$ modes.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter: From Phenomenology to Astrophysical Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a minimal, testable framework for two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in which a dominant, moderately self-interacting species coexists with an ultra-strongly self-interacting subcomponent (uSIDM). A light vector mediator induces velocity-dependent self-scattering, while early-universe dynamics - standard $2 \to 2$ annihilation supplemented by interconversion $\chi_1\chi_1 \to \chi_2\chi_2$ - determine the relic abundance analytically. From observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxy rotation curves, as well as strong cluster lensing, we place constraints on the microphysics parameters. From these constrained regions, we map the microphysics to effective \texttt{ETHOS} parameters and evolve the linear power spectrum in \texttt{CLASS}. We then confront the model with direct-detection constraints and place an upper bound on our parameter space. We identify a region where: (1) the SIDM dominant component attains $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m = 20 - 40~\text{cm}^{2}\text{g}^{-1}$ at dwarf velocities while satisfying cluster upper bounds $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m &lt; 0.13~\rm{cm}^{2}\rm{g}^{-1}$; (2) a subpercent uSIDM fraction drives accelerated gravothermal collapse in early halos, providing seeds relevant to high-redshift quasar formation and ``little red dots''; and (3) the small-scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum remains consistent with Lyman-$\alpha$ and satellite counts, but exhibits non-standard features, potentially discernible with future observations. The allowed space can be organized by the mediator-to-DM mass ratio and the late-time uSIDM fraction, with a narrow window singled out by the combined cosmological and astrophysical requirements.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Dipole Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino dipole portal (NDP) is a minimal and predictive extension of the Standard Model, in which a transition magnetic moment operator couples an active neutrino to a heavy neutral lepton via the electromagnetic field. This higher-dimensional interaction gives rise to distinctive processes such as neutrino up-scattering, radiative decays, meson transitions, and modifications of recoil spectra, offering multiple avenues for discovery. In this review, we discuss the theoretical foundations of the NDP, its ultraviolet completions, and the associated production and decay mechanisms across laboratory, astrophysical, and cosmological settings. Current constraints arise from accelerator searches, recoil-based detectors, collider studies, and high energy neutrino observatories, complemented by robust bounds from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the Cosmic Microwave Background, and supernova cooling. Future experimental and observational efforts, including next-generation neutrino experiments, multi-ton dark matter detectors, and improved cosmological and astrophysical probes, are anticipated to test the remaining allowed regions. The NDP thus provides a simple, well-motivated, and broadly testable framework at the intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Axion Models with the Anomalous $U(1)_X$ Gauge Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the generic high-quality axion models with anomalous $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry and vector-like particles. We briefly review the gauge anomaly cancellations via the Green-Schwarz mechanism, study the breaking of the $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, as well as derive the Nambu-Goldstone boson, Peccei-Quinn (PQ) axion, and axion decay constant in general. The high-dimensional operators, which break the $U(1)_{PQ}$ global symmetry, have dimension eleven or higher due to the anomalous $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, and thus the axion quality problem is solved. In particular, unlike the high-quality axion models with anomaly free $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we only need to introduce two pairs of vector-like particles. To be concrete, we present three specific models with two pairs of vector-like particles. We show that gauge anomalies in all three models can be canceled via the Green-Schwarz mechanism. To achieve gauge coupling unification, we need to introduce additional vector-like particles only in Model I. We find that gauge coupling unification is achieved at the unification scale around $10^{16}$ GeV with a relative error of less than 1\%. Notably, gauge coupling unification in Model II is achieved naturally with the smallest relative error of 0.1\%.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Leptophobic Dark Matter with Electronic Collective Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some new-generation dark matter detection experiments are primarily designed to search for the dark matter-electron interactions, but they can also be utilized to probe models in which dark matter couples exclusively to nucleon via the quantum effects. The hadronic loop-induced interactions can directly excite plasmons in semiconductors, thereby providing an additional channel for detecting the leptophobic dark matter. In this work, we investigate plasmon excitations in silicon detectors induced by boosted dark matter and cosmic-ray up-scattering dark matter via the hadronic loop process. By analyzing the available experimental data, we derive new exclusion limits on the leptophobic dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section.</description>

      <title>Heavy Neutral Lepton at Same-Sign Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the discovery potential of heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), motivated by models addressing the origin of neutrino masses, at the proposed high-energy same-sign muon collider known as $\mu$TRISTAN. The study focuses on two complementary HNL-mediated signatures: (i) the lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) channel $\mu^+\mu^+ \to W^+\tau^+\bar\nu_\mu$ and (ii) the lepton-number-violating (LNV) channel $\mu^{+}\mu^{+} \to W^{+}W^{+}$. The LNV process is the muon analogue of inverse neutrinoless double beta decay and, if observed, would provide strong evidence for Majorana neutrinos, while the LFV process offers a novel probe of flavor-changing neutral currents in the lepton sector. At the $\mu$TRISTAN collider with $\sqrt{s} \sim \mathcal{O}(10)~\text{TeV}$, the resulting sensitivity to the HNL mixing with muon and tau neutrinos, as a function of mass, can surpass current bounds from the measurements of electroweak precision observables over a broad mass range. In particular, for the mixing with muon neutrinos, the collider bound can improve by an order of magnitude for $5$-$10$ TeV HNLs.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic characteristics as probes into the inner structures of the predicted $\Xi_c^{(',*)}D^{(*)}_s$ molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the electromagnetic properties, specifically the magnetic moments and the M1 radiative decay behavior, of the predicted $\Xi_c^{(',*)}D^{(*)}_s$-type double-charm hidden-strangeness molecular pentaquarks. The study is carried out within the framework of the constituent quark model to evaluate these electromagnetic observables, and our analysis incorporates three distinct scenarios: single-channel analysis, $S$-$D$ wave mixing analysis, and coupled-channel analysis. The calculated magnetic moments reveal characteristic patterns that reflect their underlying constituent configurations and provide sensitive probes for their quantum number assignments. Furthermore, we identify several M1 radiative decay channels with sizable widths that may offer promising signatures for future experimental detection. These M1 transitions also act as sensitive probes into their inner structures, displaying distinctive features that help differentiate between their constituent configurations and quantum number assignments. We anticipate that this study will stimulate experimental interest in exploring the electromagnetic properties of the $\Xi_c^{(',*)}D^{(*)}_s$ molecular states, thereby advancing our structural understanding of these exotic hadronic states.</description>

Abstract: Remarkably accurate fine structure constants are calculated from assumptions further developed from two earlier publications. We have put together a series of energy scales related to various physical phenomena such as the Planck scale, a scale, which we call ``fermion tip'' being a certain extrapolation related to the heaviest Fermions in the Standard Model, an approximate SU(5) unification scale (without susy); and then we found, that as function of the power of an imagined lattice link length supposedly relevant for the scale in question, these powers are rather well linearly related to the logarithms of the associated energy scales. The coincidence of these scales fitting a straight line is remarkable and in some cases quite intriguing. It is evidence for Nature truly having a fluctuating lattice, meaning, that the size of the links say fluctuate quantum mechanically. We review a self-reference obtaining the three fine structure constants via three theoretically predictable quantities, among which is a scale on our straight line plot, namely for an approximate SU(5)-like unification (SU(5) coupling relations are only true in a classical approximation). Concentrating on the four energy scales, for which most precise numbers make sense (this is new in the present article), we interpolate to the approximate unification scale to such an accuracy, that it combined with the quantum corrections making the deviation from genuine SU(5) delivers the differences between the three inverse fine structure constants agreeing within errors being a few units on the second place after the comma! E.g. we predict the difference between the non-abelian inverse fine structure constants at the Z-mass MZ to be (1/alpha2 - 1/alpha3)(M_Z)predict=29.62-8.42 =21.20, while the experimental difference is 29.57-8.44=21.13 both with uncertainties of order +/- 0.05.</description>

      <title>Towards a Post-Inflationary Composite Axion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite axions offer a scenario where the axion emerges as a pion-like state, avoiding fine-tuning of elementary scalars and ameliorating the axion quality problem. Despite these advantages, their post-inflationary cosmology remains largely unexplored, with challenges including the domain wall problem and the presence of exotic relics. We propose two composite axion models with an effective domain wall number $N_\text{DW} = 1$ and study the dilution of relics via a short period of inflation. One model is based on an $SU(5)$ chiral gauge theory, while the other employs a ``gauged'' $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry in vector-like $SU(N)$ gauge theories. We identify the viable parameter space in which axion strings re-enter the horizon before or even after the QCD transition and axion dark matter is dominantly produced from the decay of the string-wall network.</description>

      <title>The Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter:connecting precision muon physics, cosmology, and colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter (MPVDM), a minimal yet phenomenologically rich extension of the Standard Model featuring a new SU(2)_D gauge symmetry and vector-like muons. In this framework the dark sector interacts with the Standard Model only through these heavy leptons, linking dark matter and the muon sector. The MPVDM can simultaneously explain the observed relic abundance and the muon anomalous magnetic moment a_mu under both the "tension" and "compatibility" scenarios motivated by recent (g-2)_mu results. A key finding is a generic off-resonance velocity suppression mechanism that allows light (&lt;1 GeV) vector dark matter to evade CMB limits near 2*m_DM ~ m_H_D. Unlike scenarios based on ultra narrow Breit-Wigner resonances and early kinetic decoupling, the suppression follows from the temperature evolution of the annihilation cross section in a moderately detuned near resonant regime, where being 10-20 percent below resonance gives the required CMB era suppression without fine tuning. A five dimensional parameter scan shows that the tension scenario requires sub GeV dark matter with g_D ~ 1e-3 and TeV scale vector like muons, while the compatibility scenario admits a broad mass range up to multi TeV. Recasting ATLAS and CMS searches for mu+ mu- + E_T^miss sets a lower bound of about 850 GeV on vector like muons. The MPVDM thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally accessible framework linking dark matter and muon physics across cosmological and collider frontiers.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Attractor Models of Inflation and Reheating from Planck, BICEP/Keck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ from Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) data, focusing on their implications for attractor models of inflation. We compare systematically observational bounds with theoretical predictions for both E-model ($\alpha$-Starobinsky) and T-model potentials. The observational constraints accommodate E-models with $\alpha \lesssim 25$, with the canonical Starobinsky model ($\alpha = 1$) predicting $n_s = 0.958-0.963$ for reheating temperatures between $100 - 10^{10}$ GeV, in good agreement with Planck 2018 data and within the 95% CL region determined by the Planck-ACT-SPT combination, but below the 95% confidence region of the Planck-ACT-DESI combination. Higher reheating temperatures from near-instantaneous reheating improve the compatibility. T-models predict slightly lower $n_s$ values (0.956-0.961), in some tension with Planck 2018 data, and we find an upper limit of $\alpha \lesssim 11$ in these models. We extend our analysis to generalized $\alpha$-attractors with monomial potentials $V(\varphi) \propto \varphi^k$ near the minimum, demonstrating that models with $k \geq 6$ naturally predict $n_s \simeq 0.965 - 0.968$ for typical number of $e$-folds, in better agreement with the ACT DR6 data. We also consider deformed E- and T-models, which allow significantly higher values of $n_s$ for low values of $\alpha \simeq 1$.</description>

      <title>Two-loop QCD corrections for real and off-shell diphoton and triphoton production via quark loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute squared matrix elements at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics for the production of two or three (on- or off-shell) photons mediated via (light or heavy) quark loops. Our method handles all cases in a unified framework, using simultaneous subtraction of infrared, ultraviolet, and threshold singularities in loop momentum space to produce a locally finite integrand suitable for numerical integration. We confirm agreement with available analytic benchmarks at fixed phase-space points and provide new results otherwise. We also compute the double-virtual corrections to the cross section for on- and off-shell diphoton and on-shell triphoton production by combining the Monte Carlo integration over loop and phase space.</description>

      <title>NLO analysis of the subleading-power $Q_1-Q_{7\gamma}$ interference in $\bar{B}\to X_s\gamma$ at large photon energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on progress towards including next-to-leading order (NLO) radiative corrections to the subleading-power factorization formula for the $Q_1^{q}-Q_{7\gamma}$ interference contribution in $\bar{B}\to X_s\gamma$ at large photon energies, $m_b - 2E_\gamma = \mathcal{O}(\Lambda_{\rm QCD})$. The novel ingredients for a NLO analysis are the one-loop anomalous dimension of the subleading shape function $g_{17}(\omega,\omega_1;\mu)$, which was recently computed by us, and the two-loop corrections to the jet function with an internal charm loop. Here we summarize the renormalization of $g_{17}(\omega,\omega_1;\mu)$, and further discuss that our insights allow for a simplified renormalization of a specific generalization of a three-particle $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude, but with non-aligned light-like separations of the fields.</description>

      <title>Modelling $b\bar b H$ production for the LHC at 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new state-of-the-art predictions for Standard Model Higgs boson production in association with a bottom-quark pair ($b\bar bH$). Updated cross sections are computed in accordance with the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Working Group, including the use of the PDF4LHC21 set of parton distribution functions, with a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV. For the total inclusive cross section, we provide matched predictions of the massless five-flavour scheme (5FS) and the massive four-flavour scheme (4FS) at the fixed-order level. We further present recently obtained simulations matched with parton showers in both flavour schemes within the SM, and also discuss them in the context of potential BSM scenarios. In the massless scheme, we compare different NNLO+PS predictions obtained through the MiNNLOPS and GENEVA generators. In addition, the role of 4FS predictions is studied as a background to $HH$ searches, considering both the top-quark and bottom-quark Yukawa contributions to $b\bar bH$ production. Finally, we analyse the sensitivity of the Higgs transverse momentum spectrum to light-quark Yukawa couplings in the diphoton decay channel based on MiNNLOPS simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deploy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in Light-front Quantization (and Gauge), discretized and truncated in both Fock -- and momentum -- spaces with a particle-register encoding suited for quantum simulation; we show for the first time how to calculate fragmentation functions, a problem heretofore untractable in general from \emph{ab-initio} approaches. We provide a classical-simulator based proof-of-concept by computing the charm-to-charmonium fragmentation, $c\to J/\psi$, in a simplified setup, an interesting case where we can (reasonably) compare with the known 1993 perturbative evaluation within Nonrelativistic QCD.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD$\otimes$QED corrections to unpolarized and polarized SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first computation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) pure QED and mixed QCD$\otimes$QED corrections to unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS). Building on our previous NNLO QCD results, these corrections are crucial for improving the theoretical precision. The coefficient functions are derived within the QCD factorization framework using dimensional regularization, with consistent renormalization and mass factorization. A detailed phenomenological analysis shows that the NNLO QED and QCD$\otimes$QED terms enhance perturbative stability and reduce scale uncertainties. These results are essential for high-precision SIDIS predictions at future facilities such as the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Holographic Systems out of Equilibrium: From Flavor Branes to SYK Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis studies the non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly coupled quantum systems within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, with particular emphasis on periodically driven (Floquet) systems. The first part focuses on top-down holographic constructions based on D3/D5 and D3/D7 brane intersections subjected to time-dependent external fields. In the D3/D5 system at finite temperature, we analyze the response to a rotating electric field and uncover a rich non-equilibrium phase structure containing conductive and insulating phases, vector meson Floquet condensates, and Floquet suppression points. In the D3/D7 setup, we study the effects of helical magnetic fields on chiral symmetry breaking, showing that sufficiently helical magnetc fields can restore chiral symmetry. The second part examines the periodically driven Maldacena-Qi model, a two-site extension of the SYK model dual to a traversable wormhole. We identify resonances that enhance or suppress the wormhole traversability and find evidence that the unstable region of the phase diagram can be dynamically accessed. We use our driving protocols to access this region and compute its Lyapunov exponent. Overall, this thesis advances the use of the holographic techniques to probe non-equilibrium steady states and real-time dynamics in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Using Strong Lensing to Detect Subhalos with Steep Inner Density Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inner region of a subhalo's density distribution is particularly sensitive to dark matter microphysics, with alternative dark matter models leading to both cored and steeply-rising inner density profiles. This work investigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter subhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations depends on the subhalo's radial density profile, especially with regards to the inner power-law slope, $\beta$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo detectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on $\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\beta \sim 2.2$ can be detected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\beta \sim 1$. Importantly, we find that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally affected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model. This is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or shallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations are added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the underlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of subhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is important for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with diverse inner density profiles.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we provide a full map of scattering scenarios between a Nielsen-Olesen vortex and antivortex. Importantly, in the deep type II regime, such a collision reveals a chaotic pattern in the final state formation with bounce windows immersed into annihilation regions. This structure is due to the energy transfer mechanism triggered by a quasinormal mode, specifically the Feshbach resonant mode, hosted by the vortex.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields around black hole binaries in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry searches in CMS Run 2: A complete review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Run 2 data-taking period of the CERN Large Hadron Collider during years 2015-2018 provided about 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV, offering an unprecedented opportunity to explore supersymmetry (SUSY) across a wide range of experimental signatures. CMS responded with a broad and diverse search program, carrying out dozens of analyses that probed a multitude of final states and systematically explored different regions of the SUSY parameter space. No significant deviations from standard model predictions were observed, and the results were used for constraining the SUSY landscape. In this review, I provide a comprehensive account of the CMS Run 2 SUSY program, covering its strategy, targeted models, and analysis methods. I then present the full set of searches and conclude with their combined impact through simplified model and phenomenological MSSM interpretations.</description>

      <title>Constraining a de Broglie-Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the non-standard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce, $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anti-correlation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified viewpoint of Gribov--Zwanziger and Serreau--Tissier gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a unified Landau--gauge fixing that continuously interpolates between the viewpoints of the Serreau--Tissier (ST) copy-averaged formulation and the (Refined) Gribov--Zwanziger (RGZ) restriction to the first Gribov region. By combining the ST weight with a GZ-type horizon term and localizing both through the replica trick and the BRST-invariant $A_\mu^h$ formulation, we obtain a single, local, BRST-invariant, power-counting renormalizable action. Algebraic renormalization shows that all counterterms are reabsorbed by a common set of field and parameter renormalizations, therefore the unification is algebraic rather than merely additive. The replica sector yields a radiatively generated gluon screening mass, while the RGZ parameters are fixed by the horizon and condensate gap equations; we also give infrared matching conditions that link both descriptions at small momentum. We present a compact BRST-superspace rewriting of the RGZ block and a simple hybrid superspace that hosts the ST replicas and RGZ side by side; these add no dynamics and organize the Ward-identity analysis. The resulting gluon propagator interpolates among the massive Faddeev--Popov--ST and the RGZ decoupling forms. This framework offers a controlled way to study how infrared Yang--Mills correlators depend on the balance between copy averaging and horizon suppression, and it suggests practical lattice tests through tunable copy weighting.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive analysis of dissipative effects in the induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipation is an intrinsic property of the cosmic fluid, leading to the damping of curvature perturbations at small scales. In this paper, we comprehensively study dissipative effects in gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations, known as induced gravitational waves (IGWs). We find dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles. They can leave characteristic features on the IGW spectrum, including a notable suppression with a ``double-valley'' structure at $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ and a modified infrared behavior without logarithmic running at $k \lesssim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism. These dissipative effects not only provide a more realistic description of IGWs but also exhibit rich phenomenology and profound physical implications, opening a new window into understanding the early Universe and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Charm-strange meson production in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charm-strange mesons, or $D_s$, $D_s^*$, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons by focusing on their production by coalescence from a quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Starting from the investigation of the transverse momentum distribution of both charm and strange quarks through transverse momentum distributions of $\phi$ and $D^0$ mesons, we calculate the transverse momentum distributions and yields of $D_s$, $D_s^*$, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$ mesons based on the coalescence model. We find that the yield and transverse momentum distribution of the $D_s$ meson agree well with the experimental measurements at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV at LHC. We further evaluate the transverse momentum ratio between $D_s$ and $D^0$ mesons, and investigate the role of light and strange quarks in the production of charmed mesons in heavy ion collisions. Finally, we calculate the transverse momentum distribution and yield of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson in a four-quark state, and compare to those of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson in a two-quark state.</description>

      <title>Analysis note: measurement of thrust and track energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions at 91.2 GeV with DELPHI open data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical developments, as well as experimental measurements at hadron collisions, have renewed interest in studying event shape variables in $e^+e^-$ collisions. We present a measurement of thrust and track-based energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions at center-of-mass energy of 91.2 GeV, using newly released open data from the DELPHI experiment. The event shapes, measured with unprecedented resolution and precision, are compared to various Monte Carlo and analytic predictions. Leveraging DELPHI's unique detector geometry and reconstruction capabilities, the track energy-energy correlator measurement provides data with the highest angular resolution, offering critical inputs for precision tests of QCD in both collinear and back-to-back limits. This note presents the first physics analysis using DELPHI open data and establishes benchmarks necessary for future studies exploiting this legacy dataset.</description>

      <title>AT2025ulz and S250818k: zooming in with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up of the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k. Its young age ($\lesssim$1 d), rapid decline and strong color evolution over the first 48 hr classify it as a potential kilonova candidate. In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time evolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset ($\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\sim5$ brighter than AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce. Only a small subset of our kilonova models matches its multi-color light curve, and the inferred ejecta mass is uncomfortably large given the low chirp mass ($\lesssim\!0.87\!$ M$_{\odot}$) of the GW candidate. HST observations place the transient within a nearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a color ($F336W-F160W\!\approx\!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a kilonova. Our data support the classification of AT2025ulz as a supernova, initially undergoing a shock-cooling phase and later entering its photospheric phase, and spectroscopically identified via its broad absorption features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.08919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the soft behavior of QCD amplitudes involving multiple Wilson lines and derive compact analytic expressions for double soft gluon and double soft quark emissions at one loop. The color correlations of the soft current exhibit a predominantly dipole structure, coupling to two hard legs at a time, apart from an abelian contribution that factorizes into products of one-loop and tree-level single soft currents, which may involve up to three hard legs. The kinematic dependence of the one-loop soft currents is expressed in terms of polylogarithmic functions, with explicit results presented for time-like kinematics. We further discuss the analytic continuation to other kinematic configurations and identify non-trivial crossing effects when continuing into incoming states. The squared amplitude is found to be invariant under crossing, which implies that the fully differential soft function and in particular the TMD soft function, remains universal up to three loops.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Spin-3/2 Particles During Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the density of a spin-$\frac32$ particle, the raritron, produced at the end of inflation due to gravitational interactions. We consider a background inflaton condensate as the source of this production, mediated by the exchange of a graviton. This production greatly exceeds the gravitational production from the emergent thermal bath during reheating. The relic abundance limit sets an absolute minimum mass for a stable raritron, though there are also model dependent constraints imposed by unitarity. We also examine the case of gravitational production of a gravitino, taking into account the goldstino evolution during reheating. We compare these results with conventional gravitino production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrino charges at beam experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method to constrain neutrino charges at neutrino beam experiments. Uncharged in the Standard Model, evidence for a neutrino electric charge would be a smoking gun for new physics, shedding light on the Dirac or Majorana nature of neutrinos, and giving insight into the origin of charge quantization. We find that using the most sensitive magnetometers available, existing beam experiments could constrain neutrino charges $|q_{\nu}| \lesssim 10^{-13}$, in units of the electron charge, while future upgrades could strengthen these bounds significantly. We also discuss electromagnetic dipole moments and show that our proposal is highly sensitive to new long-range forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the coupling of the strong force. Denoted as $\alpha_s$, it sets the strength of that force, just as $G$ or $\alpha$ specify the strength of the gravity and electromagnetism. Its value depends on the scale at which phenomena are observed. In this chapter, we will explain the nature of the coupling, the quantum origin of its scale dependence, and the crucial consequences this entails for quantum chromodynamics, the gauge theory for the strong force. We describe the theories for the calculation of $\alpha_s$, using the perturbative method at high-momentum scales (equivalently, short-distance scales) and nonperturbative approaches at low-momentum scales (equivalently, long-distance scales). We also present the experimental determinations of $\alpha_s$ at both short and long distance scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a complete joint angular distribution analysis for the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to J/\psi\to B(\to B_1\pi)\bar{B}(\to \bar{B}_1\pi)$ with polarized beams, where $B$ and $B_{1}$ are hyperons. We consider both transverse and longitudinal beam polarization and analyze CP violation in the production and decay of hyperons. We present the complete Fisher information matrix for the sensitivities of the weak decay parameters $\alpha_{-},~\alpha_{+},~\phi_{\Xi}$ and $\bar{\phi}_{\Xi}$, the P-violating term $F_{A}$, and the EDM $d_{B}$ (derived from the CP-violating term $H_{T}$), under the BESIII and STCF statistics. We find that polarization enhances the sensitivity of the parameters. Specifically, longitudinal polarization provides a more significant improvement compared to transverse polarization, with the enhancement being more pronounced for single-step decays than for multi-step decays. With the expected statistics from the BESIII experiment, the estimated EDM sensitivities for $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^{+}$ are on the order of $10^{-19}~e~\rm cm$, while those for $\Xi^{-}$ and $\Xi^{0}$ are $10^{-18}~e~\rm cm$. Furthermore, the STCF experiment is expected to improve these estimates by $1\sim2$ orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The Electric Dipole Moment of the electron in the decoupling limit of the aligned Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a discussion of model-independent contributions to the EDM of the electron. We focus on those contributions that emerge from a heavy scalar sector that is linearly realized. In particular, we explore the decoupling limit of the aligned 2HDM. In this model, Barr-Zee diagrams with a fermion loop produce logarithmically-enhanced contributions that are proportional to potentially large new sources of CP violation. In the decoupling limit these contributions are generated by effective dimension-6 operators via the mixing of four-fermion operators into electroweak dipole operators. These logarithmic contributions are not present in more constrained versions of the 2HDM where a $\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry is imposed, which then controls the basis of effective operators needed to describe the new physics contributions to the electron EDM. Thus, the $\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry provides a suppression mechanism. In the course of the comparison of the results from the aligned 2HDM with the leading logarithms from SMEFT, we needed to specify or correct signs of expressions found in the literature. We then study how the experimental bounds on the electron EDM constrain the set of parameters of the aligned 2HDM.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Observables in Neutrino-Electron Scattering from a Muon Storage Ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of a companion neutrino detector situated in the plane of a high-energy, high-intensity muon storage ring to elastic $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_e$ scattering on electrons (E$\nu$ES). Assuming a muon collider with center-of-mass energies of up to 10~TeV, we report sensitivity to the weak couplings $g_V$ and $g_A$ up to around 0.05% relative error, and sensitivity to the weak mixing angle in the momentum transfer $Q \in [10^{-2}, 2]$~GeV range up to around 0.03% relative error. E$\nu$ES measurements with high-energy muon storage rings allow one to directly interrogate the momentum-transfer regime associated with the NuTeV anomaly. This level of precision allows unique sensitivity to the momentum-dependence of $\sin^2\theta_W$. We estimate that with the neutrinos from a $E_\mu = 1.5$~TeV (or higher) muon collider, the hypothesis that $\sin^2\theta_W$ does not ``run'' can be safely ruled out.</description>

      <title>Light Axion-Like Particles at Future Lepton Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that appear in many new physics scenarios, with masses spanning a broad range. In this work, we systematically study the production and detection prospects of light ALPs at future lepton colliders, including electron-positron and multi-TeV muon colliders. At lepton colliders, light ALPs can be produced in association with a photon or a $Z$ boson. For very light ALPs ($m_a &lt; 1$ MeV), the ALPs are typically long-lived and escape detection, leading to a mono-$V$ ($V = \gamma, Z$) signature. In the long-lived limit, we find that the mono-photon channel at the Tera-$Z$ stage of future electron-positron colliders provides the strongest constraints on ALP couplings to SM gauge bosons, $g_{aVV}$, thanks to the high luminosity, low background, and resonant enhancement from on-shell $Z$ bosons. At higher energies, the mono-photon cross section becomes nearly energy-independent, and the sensitivity is governed by luminosity and background. At multi-TeV muon colliders, the mono-$Z$ channel can yield complementary constraints. For heavier ALPs ($m_a &gt; 100$ MeV) that decay promptly, mono-$V$ signatures are no longer valid. In this case, ALPs can be probed via non-resonant vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, where the ALP is exchanged off-shell, leading to kinematic deviations from SM expectations. We analyze constraints from both light-by-light scattering and electroweak VBS, the latter only accessible at TeV-scale colliders. While generally weaker, these constraints are robust and model-independent. Our combined analysis shows that mono-$V$ and non-resonant VBS channels provide powerful and complementary probes of ALP-gauge boson interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive global QCD analysis of spin-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs), combining all available data on inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), as well as inclusive weak boson and jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions, simultaneously extracting spin-averaged PDFs and fragmentation functions. Including recent Jefferson Lab DIS data at high $x$, together with subleading power corrections to the leading twist framework, allows us to verify the stability of the PDFs for $W^2 \geq 4$ GeV$^2$ and quantify the uncertainties on the spin structure functions more reliably. We explore the use of new lattice QCD data on gluonic pseudo Ioffe-time distributions, which, together with jet production and high-$x$ DIS data, improve the constraints on the polarized gluon PDF. The expanded kinematic reach afforded by the data into the high-$x$ region allows us to refine the bounds on higher twist contributions to the spin structure functions, and test the validity of the Bjorken sum rule.</description>

Abstract: The possible anomalous New Physics contributions to electric and magnetic dipole moments of the $\tau$ lepton has brought renewed interest in development of new charge-parity violating signatures in the $\tau$-pair production at Belle II energies, and also at higher energies of the LHC and the FCC. In this paper, we discuss effects of anomalous contributions to cross-section and spin correlations in the $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^-\tau^+$ production processes, with $\tau$ decays included. Such processes have been observed in the $pp$ and PbPb collisions at CERN LHC experiments. Because of complex nature of the resulting distributions, Monte Carlo techniques are useful, in particular of event reweighting with studied New Physics phenomena. For the $\gamma\gamma$ processes, extensions of the Standard Model amplitudes are implemented in the TauSpinner program. This is mainly with electric and magnetic dipole moments in mind, but algorithm can be easily extended to other New Physics interactions, provided they can be encapsulated into similar form-factors in the Standard Model structure of matrix elements. Basic formulas and algorithm principles are presented, numerical examples are provided as illustration. Information on how to use the program is given in Appendix of the paper.</description>

      <title>The impact of $\gamma N$ and $\gamma^* N$ interactions on our understanding of nucleon excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review recent progress in our understanding of the nucleon excitation spectrum. Thanks to dedicated efforts at facilities such as ELSA, MAMI and Jefferson Lab, several new nucleon resonances have been discovered, and evidence for previously elusive states has been significantly improved. Numerous decay channels have been observed for the first time, and resonance properties are being extracted from these data by several groups through coupled-channel analyses of varying complexity. Electroproduction experiments have provided further insights into the internal structure of light baryon resonances -- for example, the long-debated Roper resonance $N(1440)$ is observed as a three-quark state with a significant meson-cloud component.While the non-relativistic quark model remains a valuable tool for organizing the spectrum of nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances, a variety of theoretical frameworks have emerged to offer deeper understanding, including phenomenological quark models, holographic QCD, functional methods, effective field theories, and lattice QCD. We examine the interplay between these approaches, highlight their respective strengths and explore how they complement each other in shaping our knowledge of light baryon resonances. We address several open questions in baryon spectroscopy, including the nature of the enigmatic $\Lambda(1405)$, ongoing searches for exotic states such as hybrid baryons and pentaquarks, and the dichotomy between microscopic descriptions of baryons in terms of quarks and gluons versus effective hadronic descriptions based on meson-baryon dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a scenario where the Standard Model is extended by a SU(2) gauge group in the dark sector. The three associated dark gauge bosons are stabilised via a custodial symmetry triggered by an additional dark SU(2) scalar doublet, thus making them viable dark-matter candidates. After considering the most recent constraints for this model, we analyse the phase transition dynamics and compute the power spectrum of resulting stochastic gravitational-wave background. Finally, we find regions of the parameter space yielding the observed dark-matter relic density while also leading to strong enough phase transition with an associated gravitational-wave signal reaching the sensitivity of future space-based gravitational-wave detector, such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, TianQin or Taiji.</description>

      <title>New superconvergence relations for spin and tensor structure functions of $\gamma\gamma$ fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Burkhardt--Cottingham sum rule is an exact superconvergence relation for a spin-structure function, derived from general principles of light absorption and scattering, and valid at any momentum transfer $Q^2$. I illustrate how a class of such relations emerges from the Siegert point, an unphysical kinematical point where both the probe and the target are at rest. From light-by-light scattering, new sum rules for $\gamma^\ast \gamma^\ast$ fusion are emerging, valid for arbitrary photon virtualities. Regarding the convergence of these relations, there is a simple argument for the suppression of longitudinal photon polarizations at high energy. Among its consequences is the prediction of $\sigma_L/ \sigma_T \to 0$ at high energy, for the ratio of unpolarized nucleon photoabsorption cross sections.</description>

      <title>Type I + II Seesaw Model in light of the New Neutrino Oscillation Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global analysis of neutrino oscillation data slightly favors normal mass ordering. In this work, we investigate an extended scalar sector that naturally gives rise to a type I + II seesaw mechanism after spontaneous symmetry breaking and explore the interplay between collider physics and lepton flavor violation, adopting normal ordering. In particular, we focus on the rare muon decays $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ and the same-sign dilepton searches at LHC, a canonical signature of a doubly charged scalar. We conclude that neither the precise value of the sum of the neutrino masses, taken from DESI data that favors $\sum m_\nu=0.07$~eV, nor alternative cosmological fits which prefer a more relaxed limit $\sum m_\nu=0.1$~eV, significantly changes the theoretical prediction for these rare decays. However, we observe an interesting interplay between collider physics and lepton flavor violation depending on the choices of the vacuum expectation value of the triplet scalar. In particular, we find that $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ is more constraining than $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$, and the $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ decay can yield a lower mass limit of $3$~TeV on the doubly charged scalar, surpassing current LHC constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-global logarithms are low energy correlations between the substructure of a jet and the event in which it is immersed. We study the leading non-global logarithms that arise from soft quark--anti-quark emission and calculate their coefficient as a series in the jet radius, $R$, in arbitrary processes. We calculate the exact coefficient through quadratic order in $R$, and show that this truncation is within $5\%$ of the complete result for radii up to $R = 1$. These quark flavor-dependent non-global logarithms are also responsible for the infrared unsafety of a na\"ive definition of jet flavor that is simply the net sum of quark flavors in the jet of interest. We propose a small modification of this na\"ive jet flavor that we call subtractive jet flavor in which the problematic soft logarithms are explicitly subtracted. We further demonstrate how our analytic results can be interfaced with automated numerical fixed-order codes to extract subtractive jet flavor cross sections.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the strong vertices of hadronic molecules $DK$, $D^*K$, $DK^*$ and their bottom analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the strong vertices of hadronic molecules $DK$, $D^*K$, $DK^*$ and their bottom analogs within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. The coupling between interpolating currents and low spin particles is considered in the phenomenological side, and the vacuum condensates $\left\langle \bar qq \right\rangle ,\left\langle g_s^2GG \right\rangle ,\left\langle \bar qg_s\sigma Gq \right\rangle ,\left\langle g_s^3GGG \right\rangle ,{\left\langle \bar qq \right\rangle ^2}$ are included in the QCD side. As an application of strong coupling constants, we also obtain the partial decay widths of these states, where $\Gamma_{T_{DK}\rightarrow D_s\pi}=10.3_{-2.9}^{+3.0}\mathrm{KeV}$,
  $\Gamma_{T_{D^*K}\rightarrow D_s^*\pi}=24.8_{-5.4}^{+5.5}\mathrm{KeV}$, $\Gamma_{T_{BK}\rightarrow BK}=101_{-21}^{+36}\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{T_{B^*K}\rightarrow B^*K}=142_{-25}^{+52}\mathrm{MeV}$. It is shown that the results of $\Gamma_{T_{DK}\rightarrow D_s\pi}$ and $\Gamma_{T_{D^*K}\rightarrow D_s^*\pi}$ are compatible with the experimental data of $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$.</description>

      <title>One-loop QED and Weak Corrections to $\gamma \gamma \to H^\pm H^\mp$ in the Inert Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete one-loop analysis of charged scalar boson pair production in photon-photon collisions, $\gamma\gamma \to H^\pm H^\mp$, within the framework of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). The calculation is carried out in the on-shell renormalization scheme and incorporates both weak corrections and QED effects, including soft and hard photon radiation. Virtual loop contributions and real emission processes are computed using the Feynman diagrammatic method, ensuring the cancellation of ultraviolet and infrared divergences. To properly account for the Coulomb singularity that arises in the QED sector near threshold, we introduce the resummed cross section based on the Sommerfeld factor. The IDM parameter space is explored under theoretical consistency conditions, collider limits, and dark matter constraints, and three representative scenarios are studied in detail. We find that the magnitude of the quantum corrections is strongly controlled by the absolute value of the trilinear scalar coupling $\lambda_{h^0 H^+ H^-}$, which correlates with the charged scalar mass. When all constraints are applied, the weak corrections are typically in the range of $-12\%$ to $-7\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=250$~GeV, and between $-15\%$ and $6\%$ at $\sqrt{s}=500$~GeV. At higher energies, such as $\sqrt{s}=1$~TeV, the corrections can become very large, ranging from about $-20\%$ up to $+60\%$. Our findings highlight the significant role of higher-order effects in photon-photon collisions and establish $\gamma\gamma \to H^\pm H^\mp$ as a promising process to investigate the charged scalar sector of the IDM at future high-energy photon colliders. Several benchmark points are proposed to facilitate future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Maximal Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt violation for qubit-qudit states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violation for a generic (typically mixed) qubit-qudit state, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This represents the optimal (2-2-2) Bell nonlocality for this kind of systems. The work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis result for a qubit-qubit setup. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation. We apply our general results to address a number of issues, namely, we obtain a bound on the degree of purity required in a system to exhibit nonlocality and study the statistics of nonlocality in random density matrices. In addition, we show the impossibility of improving the amount of CHSH violation by embedding the qudit in a Hilbert space of larger dimension. Finally, the general result is illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

Abstract: Recent Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data have established a non-trivial temperature dependence of the shear and bulk viscosity per entropy. Motivated by this, we consider higher derivative corrections to realistic, bottom-up holographic models of quark-gluon plasma based on five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton theories and determine the dilaton potentials in the higher derivative terms by matching the Bayesian analyses. A byproduct of our analysis is the bulk viscosity that follows from the holographic V-QCD theory. Higher derivative corrections when treated perturbatively lead to tension with existing data. We investigate possible resolutions.</description>

Abstract: We present the historical antecedents to the field of relativistic heavy ion physics, beginning with early attempts to model the strong interaction and ending with the endorsement of a relativistic heavy ion collider in the 1983 U.S. Long-Range Plan for Nuclear Science. Particular attention is paid to two major themes: 1) A program to study high density states of nuclear matter emerging from the 1974 Bear Mountain conference and 2) Efforts to understand the predictions of QCD for matter at high densities and/or temperatures.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state w_X(z) as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at {z_i}={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33}, and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1\sigma for $\rho_X(z)$ &amp; ~ 2$\sigma$ for w_X(z) at z=2/3. We also find that measuring {$\rho_X(z_i)$} is preferred to measuring {w_X(z_i)} by model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Varying the choice of redshift values of the $\rho_X(z)$ measurements leads to very consistent results, with AIC/BIC slightly favoring the case of our fiducial {z_i} with z=4/3 omitted. We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

Abstract: Results from the study of the rare decays $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}$, $K^{+}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ and $K^{+}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\gamma\gamma$ at the NA62 experiment at CERN are interpreted in terms of improved limits for $\rm{B}(K^+\to\pi^+X)$ and coupling parameters of hidden-sector models, where $X$ is a mediator. World-leading limits are achieved for dark photon, dark scalar and axion-like particle models.</description>

Abstract: The streaming of neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium is known to affect the physics of flavor conversion. We employ an ensemble of single-crossed angular distributions and explore the physics of flavor conversion, while neutrinos propagate across a one-dimensional inhomogeneous medium. The advective term in the neutrino equations of motion is responsible for the cascade of flavor waves towards ever smaller spatial and angular scales. However, as the system evolves, perturbations with large wavenumbers are damped, with a resulting smearing of the flavor configuration. We provide a simple recipe that allows to forecast the steady-state flavor configuration achieved by neutrinos without solving their kinetic equations. In particular, we find that flavor equipartition on one side of the angular spectrum and the cancellation of the spectral crossing in the lepton number distributions, proposed in the literature as generic flavor outcome, is a special solution depending on the degree of neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry. This work constitutes a step forward towards the development of semi-analytic schemes to account for flavor conversion physics in hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star merger remnants.</description>
