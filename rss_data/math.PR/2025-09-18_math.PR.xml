      <title>Efficient Importance Sampling for Wrong Exit Probabilities over Combinatorially Many Rare Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider importance sampling for estimating the probability that a light-tailed $d$-dimensional random walk exits through one of many disjoint rare-event regions before reaching an anticipated target. This problem arises in sequential multiple hypothesis testing, where the number of such regions may grow combinatorially and in some cases exponentially with the dimension. While mixtures over all associated exponential tilts are asymptotically efficient, they become computationally infeasible even for moderate values of $d$. We develop a method for constructing asymptotically efficient mixtures with substantially fewer components by combining optimal tilts for a small number of regions with additional proposals that control variance across a large collection of regions. The approach is applied to the estimation of three probabilities that arise in sequential multiple testing, including a multidimensional extension of Siegmund's classical exit problem, and is supported by both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Hamiltonian Type Jump Diffusion Systems with Countable Regimes: Strong Feller Property and Exponential Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on a class of stochastic Hamiltonian type jump diffusion systems with state-dependent switching, in which the switching component has countably infinite many states.First, the existence and uniqueness of the underlying processes are obtained with the aid of successive construction methods. Then, the Feller property is established by coupling methods. Furthermore, the strong Feller property is proved by introducing some auxiliary processes and making use of appropriate Radon-Nikodym derivatives. Finally, on the basis of the above results, the exponential ergodicity is obtained under the Foster-Lyapunov drift condition.</description>

      <title>How long does it take an Elephant Random Walk to forget its training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how conditioning affects the long-term behavior of the Elephant Random Walk, focusing on its first return to the origin, namely, the time it takes to forget the training. When the walker is conditioned to be at position $n$ at time $n$, this return time scales as $n^{(4-4p)/(3-4p)}$ in the diffusive regime, and grows exponentially in the critical regime.</description>

      <title>Optimal Delocalization for Non--Hermitian Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an optimal order delocalization estimate for the eigenvectors of general $N \times N$ non-Hermitian matrices $X$: $\| {\bf v } \|_\infty \leq C \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{N}}$ with very high probability, for any right or left eigenvector ${\bf v}$ of $X$. This improves upon the previous tightest bound of Rudelson and Vershynin [arXiv:1306.2887] of $\mathcal{O}( ( \log N)^{9/2}N^{-1/2})$, and holds under weaker assumptions on the tail of the matrix elements. In addition to the coordinate basis, our bound holds for the $\ell^\infty$ norm in any deterministic orthonormal basis. Our result is proven via a dynamical method, by studying the flow of the resolvent of the Hermitization of $X$ and proving local laws on short scales.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions for a class of stochastic thermo-magneto-hydrodynamic-type systems with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, in the sense of PDEs and probability, for a broad class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on a bounded domain $\mathscr{O}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\leq 3$), perturbed by spatially correlated multiplicative noise. Our framework applies to many physically relevant systems, including stochastic convective Brinkman--Forchheimer equations, stochastic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), stochastic B\'enard convection in porous media, stochastic convective dynamo models, and stochastic magneto-micropolar fluids, among others. The analysis relies on Galerkin approximations and compactness arguments. Up to a suitable stopping time, we derive strong moment bounds and verify a Cauchy property for the approximate solutions, in the absence of any inherent cancellation structure. By applying a Gronwall-type lemma for stochastic processes, we establish the existence and uniqueness of maximal strong pathwise solutions, which are global in two spatial dimensions. These results provide a unified treatment of a wide class of nonlinear stochastic thermo-magneto-fluid models in the literature.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Rough Integrators and No Free Lunch in Rough-Path-Based Market Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Built to generalise classical stochastic calculus, rough path theory provides a natural and pathwise framework to model continuous non-semimartingale assets. This paper investigates the ultimate capacity of this framework to support frictionless continuous No-Free-Lunch markets \`a la Kreps-Yan. We establish a ``Rough Kreps-Yan" theorem, which links our No Controlled Free Lunch (NCFL) condition to the unbiasedness of the driver of the price process as a rough integrator. The central work of this paper is a complete classification of these unbiased rough integrators with respect to different classes of controlled paths as integrands. As the set of admissible trading strategies is enlarged to include Markovian-type and signature-type portfolios, the only admissible random rough paths must be infinitesimally close to the It\^o rough path lift of a standard Brownian motion, up to a time change. In particular, Gaussianity is no longer a model assumption, but rather a no-arbitrage market consequence. Notably, simple strategies do not appear in the theory, and if they are then reintroduced, the rough noise is further enforced to be the It\^o rough path of Brownian motion itself. Ultimately, this implies that continuous frictionless markets based on rough path theory are inevitably constrained to the semimartingale paradigm, providing a definitive answer on the limits of this approach. Our framework covers $\alpha-$H\"older continuous rough paths for $\alpha&gt;0$ arbitrarily small.</description>

      <title>Limit theory for mean-field control problems with common noise adapted controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a mean-field control problem in which admissible controls are required to be adapted to the common noise filtration. The main objective is to show how the mean-field control problem can be approximates by time consistent centralized finite population problems in which the central planner has full information on all agents' states and gives an identical signal to all agents. We also aim at establishing the optimal convergence rate. In a first general path-dependent setting, we only prove convergence by using weak convergence techniques of probability measures on the canonical space. Next, when only the drift coefficient is controlled, we obtain a backward SDE characterization of the value process, based on which a convergence rate is established in terms of the Wasserstein distance between the original measure and the empirical one induced by the particles. It requires Lipschitz continuity conditions in the Wasserstein sense. The convergence rate is optimal. In a Markovian setting and under convexity conditions on the running reward function, we next prove uniqueness of the optimal control and provide regularity results on the value function, and then deduce the optimal weak convergence rate in terms of the number of particles. Finally, we apply these results to the study of a classical optimal control problem with partial observation, leading to an original approximation method by particle systems.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Drmota-Verwee's effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions. Drmota and the author obtained a uniform Kolmogorov bound whose error involves $T\sum_{j&gt;L-2h}|f(F_j)|$, which assumes absolute convergence of the linear tail $\sum_j f(F_j)$. We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j&gt;L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|&gt;1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$. Either form requires only $\sum f(F_j)^2&lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>A local limit theorem for a random walk in an intermittent dynamical environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an extended dynamical system on the non-negative real line with piecewise linear non-uniformly expanding local dynamics. With a uniformly distributed initial state, the distribution of the successive states coincides with that of a random walk in an inhomogeneous environment. Under suitable conditions on the environment, we establish a central limit theorem and a (non-Gaussian) local limit theorem for the walk. Our approach builds on the work of Leskel\"a and Stenlund (Stochastic Process.\ Appl.\ 121(12), 2011), who analyzed a corresponding model with uniformly expanding local dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fixation and stationary times for the $\Lambda$-Wright-Fisher process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fixation and stationary behavior of the Lambda-Wright-Fisher process with parent-independent mutation and finitely many types, a jump-diffusion model for allele frequency dynamics in large populations with potentially large offspring variance. Using a lookdown construction, we characterize the distribution of fixation times and the order of allele extinctions in the absence of mutations, and identify a strong stationary time in the presence of mutations. Our results include explicit expressions for the mean fixation and stationary times for the Wright-Fisher diffusion, and mean fixation times in the Beta-coalescent case. A key component of our approach is the analysis of the fixation line introduced by H\'enard in (Ann. Appl. Probab., 25:3007-3032, 2015). We extend this process to incorporate mutation, providing a unified framework for studying both fixation and equilibrium behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two sharp, closed-form empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By applying the theory of rough paths, Martin Hairer provided a notion of solution for a class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of Burgers type, driven by additive space-time white noise in one spatial dimension. These equations exhibit spatial roughness that is too severe for classical analytical techniques to handle. Hairer developed a pathwise framework for solutions when the spatial regularity of the solution lies in the range $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$. In this paper, we generalize Hairer's result by extending the spatial regularity to the range $(0, 1]$. More precisely, we establish the pathwise existence and uniqueness of mild (and, equivalently, weak) solutions to Burgers-type SPDEs under this spatial regularity regime.</description>

      <title>Parities in random Latin squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a Latin square, every row can be interpreted as a permutation, and therefore has a parity (even or odd). We prove that in a uniformly random $n\times n$ Latin square, the $n$ row parities are very well approximated by a sequence of $n$ independent unbiased coin flips: for example, the total variation error of this approximation tends to zero as $n\to\infty$. This resolves a conjecture of Cameron. In fact, we prove a generalisation of Cameron's conjecture for the joint distribution of the row parities, column parities and symbol parities (the latter are defined by the symmetry between rows, columns and symbols of a Latin square).
  Along the way, we introduce several general techniques for the study of random Latin squares, including a new re-randomisation technique via `stable intercalate switchings', and a new approximation theorem comparing random Latin squares with a certain independent model.</description>

      <title>A Chinese restaurant process for multiset permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multisets are like sets, except that they can contain multiple copies of their elements. If there are $n_i$ copies of $i$, $1\leq i\leq t$, in multiset $M_t$, then there are $\binom{n_1+\cdots+n_t}{n_1,\ldots, n_t}$ possible permutations of $M_t$. Knuth showed how to factor any multiset permutation into cycles. For fixed $n_i$, $i\geq 1$, we show how to adapt the Chinese restaurant process, which generates random permutations on $n$ elements with weighting $\theta^{\# \, {\rm cycles}}$, $\theta&gt;0$, sequentially for $n=1,2,\ldots$, to the multiset case, where we fix the $n_i$ and build permutations on $M_t$ sequentially for $t=1,2,\ldots$. The number of cycles of a multiset permutation chosen uniformly at random, i.e.~$\theta=1$, has distribution given by the sum of independent negative hypergeometric distributed random variables. For all $\theta&gt;0$, and under the assumption that $n_i=O(1)$, we show a central limit theorem as $t\to\infty$ for the number of cycles.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control problems with measurable coefficients and $L_d$-drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider controlled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with measurable coefficients, a uniformly elliptic diffusion coefficient and an $L_d$-drift. No space-regularity will be assumed for the coefficients. In this framework we investigate the relation of value functions, partial differential equations (PDEs) and operator semigroups. First, for a cost with infinite time horizon on a bounded domain, we identify the value function as $L_{d_0}$-viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and we establish quantitative regularity estimates. The constant $d_0 \in (d/2, d)$ only depends on the space dimension $d$, the ellipticity constants of the diffusion coefficient and the $L_d$-bound of the drift. To illustrate applications of these results, we provide a uniqueness theorem under an additional assumption on the diffusion coefficient, showing a stochastic representation, and we discuss stability of value functions. Second, we consider a cost with a finite time horizon, terminal and running terms. We show that the value function indexed over the terminal cost is a nonlinear semigroup on $C_b (\mathbb{R}^d)$ and we establish a regularization by noise effect, which shows that the semigroup regularizes lower semicontinuity to local H\"older continuity. Lastly, we relate the semigroup to a parabolic PDE, showing that it is an $L_{d + 1}$-viscosity solution, and we establish local in time and global in space quantitative regularity estimates. Our proofs for the regularity of the value functions, the $C_b$-Feller property of the semigroup and its regularization by noise effects are based on a strong Markov selection principle and analytic estimates for linear diffusions that were recently established by N. V. Krylov in a series of papers. We highlight that our method covers frameworks without uniqueness of the controlled SDEs, as well as the associated PDEs.</description>

      <title>A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Joint Moments of Characteristic Polynomials from the Orthogonal and Unitary Symplectic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish asymptotic formulae for general joint moments of characteristic polynomials and their higher-order derivatives associated with matrices drawn randomly from the groups $\mathrm{USp}(2N)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ in the limit as $N\to\infty$. This relates the leading-order asymptotic contribution in each case to averages over the Laguerre ensemble of random matrices. We uncover an exact connection between these joint moments and a solution of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'{e} V equation, valid for finite matrix size, as well as a connection between the leading-order asymptotic term and a solution of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'{e} III$'$ equation in the limit as $N \rightarrow \infty$. These connections enable us to derive exact formulae for joint moments for finite matrix size and for the joint moments of certain random variables arising from the Bessel point process in a recursive way. As an application, we provide a positive answer to a question proposed by Altu\u{g} et al.</description>
