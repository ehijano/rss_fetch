      <title>Brill--Noether theory of smooth curves in the plane and on Hirzebruch surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the Brill--Noether theory of a general smooth plane curve and a general curve $C$ on a Hirzebruch surface of fixed class. It is natural to study the line bundles on such curves according to the splitting type of their pushforward along projection maps $C \to \mathbb{P}^1$. Inspired by Wood's parameterization of ideal classes in rings associated to binary forms, we further refine the stratification of line bundles $L$ on $C$ by fixing the splitting types of both $L$ and $L(\Delta)$, where $\Delta \subset C$ is the intersection of $C$ with the directrix of the Hirzebruch surface. Our main theorem determines the dimensions of these locally closed strata and, if the characteristic of the ground field is zero, proves that they are smooth.</description>

      <title>Projective surfaces not as Hadamard products and the dimensions of the Hadamard joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dimensions of Hadamard products of $k\ge 3$ varieties if we allow to modify $k-1$ of them by the action of a general projective linear transformation. We also prove that the join of a variety not contained in a coordinate hyperplane with a ``nice'' curve always has the expected dimension.</description>

      <title>CscK metrics on rank one spherical Fano fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This four-pages note is an invitation to explore explicit K-stability for arbitrary K\"ahler classes of low dimension and low rank spherical varieties. We apply our simple combinatorial criterion of K-stability of rank one spherical varieties to the example of the blowup of the product of two copies of the projective planes along the diagonal, and obtain strong indication that it admits cscK metrics in every K\"ahler classes.</description>

      <title>Integrable system on minimal nilpotent orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every complex simple Lie algebra, the equations of Schubert divisors on the flag variety give a complete integrable system of the minimal nilpotent orbit. The approach is motivated by the integrable system on Coulomb branch. We give explicit computations of these Hamiltonian functions, using Chevalley basis and a so-called Heisenberg algebra basis. For classical Lie algebras we rediscover the lower order terms of the celebrated Gelfand-Zeitlin system. For exceptional types we computed the number of Hamiltonian functions associated to each vertex of Dynkin diagram. They should be regarded as analogs of Gelfand-Zeitlin functions on exceptional type Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>An Update on the Classification of Rank 2 Weak Fano Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an update on the classification of smooth weak Fano threefolds with Picard number two and small anti-canonical maps is given. Geometric constructions are provided for previously open numerical cases by blowing up certain curves on smooth Fano threefolds of Picard number one. This paper provides updated tables in the Appendix and reduces the 14 remaining E1-E* open cases to four.</description>

      <title>Flow lines on the moduli space of rank $2$ twisted Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the gradient flow lines for the $L^2$ norm square of the Higgs field defined on the moduli space of semistable rank $2$ Higgs bundles twisted by a line bundle of positive degree over a compact Riemann surface $X$. The main result is that these spaces of flow lines have an algebro-geometric classification in terms of secant varieties for different embeddings of $X$ into the projectivisation of the negative eigenspace of the Hessian at a critical point. The compactification of spaces of flow lines given by adding broken flow lines then has a natural interpretation via a projection to Bertram's resolution of secant varieties.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic morphisms, tangential basepoints, and little disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of ``virtual morphisms'' in logarithmic algebraic geometry, introduced by Howell. It allows one to give algebro-geometric meaning to various useful maps of topological spaces that do not correspond to morphisms of (log) schemes in the classical sense, while retaining functoriality of key constructions. In particular, we explain how virtual morphisms provide a natural categorical home for Deligne's theory of tangential basepoints: the latter are simply the virtual morphisms from a point. We also extend Howell's results on the functoriality of Betti and de Rham cohomology.
  Using this framework, we lift the topological operad of little $2$-disks to an operad in log schemes over the integers, whose virtual points are isomorphism classes of stable marked curves of genus zero equipped with a tangential basepoint. The gluing of such curves along marked points is performed using virtual morphisms that transport tangential basepoints around the curves. This builds on Vaintrob's analogous construction for framed little disks, for which the classical notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry sufficed. In this way, we obtain a direct algebro-geometric proof of the formality of the little disks operad, following the strategy envisioned by Beilinson. Furthermore, Bar-Natan's parenthesized braids naturally appear as the fundamental groupoids of our moduli spaces, with all virtual basepoints defined over the integers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the families of solvable and nilpotent matroids, and study their realization spaces and their closures. Specifically, we analyze their associated varieties and their irreducible decompositions. Additionally, we study a subfamily of nilpotent matroids, called weak nilpotent matroids, and compute a finite set of defining equations of their associated matroid varieties.</description>

      <title>A tour d'horizon of de Casteljau's work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whilst Paul de Casteljau is now famous for his fundamental algorithm of curve and surface approximation, little is known about his other findings. This article offers an insight into his results in geometry, algebra and number theory.
  Related to geometry, his classical algorithm is reviewed as an index reduction of a polar form. This idea is used to show de Casteljau's algebraic way of smoothing, which long went unnoticed. We will also see an analytic polar form and its use in finding the intersection of two curves. The article summarises unpublished material on metric geometry. It includes theoretical advances, e.g., the 14-point strophoid or a way to link Apollonian circles with confocal conics, and also practical applications such as a recurrence for conjugate mirrors in geometric optics. A view on regular polygons leads to an approximation of their diagonals by golden matrices, a generalisation of the golden ratio.
  Relevant algebraic findings include matrix quaternions (and anti-quaternions) and their link with Lorentz' equations. De Casteljau generalised the Euclidean algorithm and developed an automated method for approximating the roots of a class of polynomial equations. His contributions to number theory not only include aspects on the sum of four squares as in quaternions, but also a view on a particular sum of three cubes. After a review of a complete quadrilateral in a heptagon and its angles, the paper concludes with a summary of de Casteljau's key achievements.
  The article contains a comprehensive bibliography of de Casteljau's works, including previously unpublished material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study automorphism and birational automorphism groups of varieties over fields of positive characteristic from the point of view of Jordan and $p$-Jordan property. In particular, we show that the Cremona group of rank $2$ over a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$ is $p$-Jordan, and the birational automorphism group of an arbitrary geometrically irreducible algebraic surface is nilpotently $p$-Jordan of class at most $2$. Also, we show that the automorphism group of a smooth geometrically irreducible projective variety of non-negative Kodaira dimension is Jordan in the usual sense.</description>

Abstract: We classify twistings of Grothendieck's differential operators on a smooth variety $X$ in prime characteristic $p$. We prove isomorphism classes of twistings are in bijection with $H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}_p(1))$, the degree 2, weight 1 syntomic cohomology of $X$. We also discuss the relationship between twistings of crystalline and Grothendieck differential operators. Twistings in mixed characteristic are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Regularity, singularities and $h$-vector of graded algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.01116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a standard graded algebra over a field. We investigate how the singularities of $R$ affect its $h$-vector, which is the coefficients of the numerator of its Hilbert series. The most concrete consequences of our work asserts that if $R$ satisfies Serre's condition $(S_r)$ and have reasonable singularities (Du Bois on the punctured spectrum or $F$-pure), then $h_0,\dots, h_r\geq 0$. Furthermore the multiplicity of $R$ is at least $h_0+h_1+\dots+h_{r-1}$. We also prove that equality in many cases forces $R$ to be Cohen-Macaulay. The main technical tools are sharp bounds on regularity of certain Ext modules, which can be viewed as Kodaira-type vanishing statements for Du Bois and $F$-singularities. Many corollaries are deduced, for instance that nice singularities of small codimension must be Cohen-Macaulay. Our results build on and extend previous work by de Fernex-Ein, Eisenbud-Goto, Huneke-Smith, Murai-Terai and others.</description>

      <title>Regularized integrals and manifolds with log corners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a natural geometric framework for the study of logarithmically divergent integrals on manifolds with corners and algebraic varieties, using the techniques of logarithmic geometry. Key to the construction is a new notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry itself, introduced by Howell, which allows us to interpret the ubiquitous rule of thumb ``$\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \log \epsilon := 0$'' as the restriction to a submanifold. Via a version of de Rham's theorem with logarithmic divergences, we obtain a functorial characterization of the classical theory of ``regularized integration'': it is the unique way to extend the ordinary integral to the logarithmically divergent context while respecting the basic laws of calculus (change of variables, Fubini's theorem, and Stokes' formula.)</description>

Abstract: We prove that the dual fine Selmer group of an abelian variety over the unramified $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-extension of a function field is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. This is a function field version of a conjecture of Coates--Sujatha. We further prove that the fine Selmer group is finite (respectively zero) if the separable $p$-primary torsion of the abelian variety is finite (respectively zero).</description>

Abstract: We prove D\'{e}vissage theorems for Hermitian $K$ Theory (or $GW$ theory), analogous to Quillen's D\'{e}vissage theorem for $K$-theory. For abelian categories ${\mathscr A}:=({\mathscr A}, ^{\vee}, \varpi)$ with duality, and appropriate abelian subcategories ${\mathscr B}\subseteq {\mathscr A}$, we prove D\'{e}vissage theorems for ${\bf GW}$ spaces, $G{\mathcal W}$-spectra and ${\mathbb G}W$ bispectra. As a consequence, for regular local rings $R$ with $1/2\in R$, we compute the ${\mathbb G}W$ groups ${\mathbb G}W^{[n]}_k(Spec{R})$ forall $k, n\in {\mathbb Z}$, where $n$ represent the translation.</description>
