      <title>Global optimization of harmonic oscillator basis in covariant density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present investigation focuses on the improvement of the accuracy of the description of binding energies within moderately sized fermionic basis. Using the solutions corresponding to infinite fermionic basis it was shown for the first time that in the case of meson exchange (ME) covariant energy density functionals (CEDFs) the global accuracy of the description of binding energies in the finite $N_F=16-20$ bases can be drastically (by a factor of $\approx 3.5$) improved by a global optimization of oscillator frequency of the basis. This is a consequence of the unique feature of the ME functionals in which with increasing fermionic basis size fermionic and mesonic energies approach the exact (infinite basis) solution from above and below, respectively. As a consequence, an optimal fixed oscillator frequency $\hbar\omega_0$ of the basis can be defined which provides an accurate reproduction of exact total binding energies by the ones calculated in truncated basis. This leads to a very high accuracy of the calculations in moderately sized $N_F=20$ basis: global rms differences $\delta B_{rms}$ between the binding energies calculated in infinite and truncated bases are only $ 0.053$ MeV and $0.070$ MeV for the NL5(Z) and DD-MEZ functionals, respectively. Optimized values of the oscillator frequency $\hbar\omega_0$ are provided for three major classes of CEDFs, i.e. for density dependent meson exchange functionals, nonlinear meson exchange ones and point coupling functionals.</description>

      <title>Perturbative renormalization of chiral nuclear forces at subleading order in 3S1-3D1 channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate renormalization of chiral nuclear forces in the coupled channel of 3S1-3D1 of nucleon-nucleon scattering. The one-pion exchange potential is treated nonperturbatively at leading order while subleading potentials are perturbations. Very much like the uncoupled channel of 3P0 , the singular attraction of one-pion exchange gives rise to the so-called genuine exceptional cutoffs, where artificial correlations between subleading contact operators emerge and they result in ill-defined values of the low-energy constants. To address this issue we follow the solution proposed for 3P0 in Ref. [1] and apply it to 3S1-3D1 . The truncation uncertainty of an effective field theory allows certain degrees of freedom in choosing renormalization conditions, or fitting schemes of the low-energy constants. By exploiting this freedom near the exceptional cutoffs, we are able to remove the said correlations. A much mitigated cutoff variation of the phase shifts, which is acceptable to the power counting, is thus obtained.</description>

      <title>Concentrated valence nucleons transfer in heavy-ion collisions: implications for questing the stable superheavy elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multinucleon transfer process is regarded as a promising pathway for producing the stable superheavy elements. However, the underlying mechanism, especially the possible transfer channels for sailing to the ``island of stability'' are poorly known. In this work, the time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory is used to investigate the collision dynamics of $^{136}$Xe, $^{198}$Pt, $^{238}$U + $^{238}$U reactions. A novel reaction channel of the concentrated valence nucleons (CVN) transferring is found in the collisions heading on the tips of $^{238}$U. These nucleons are transferred with relatively short relaxation time and break the symmetry of nucleon exchange in the early reaction stage. In consequence, the mass equilibrium with relaxation time is deviated from the systematic behavior based on the macroscopic-microscopic potential energy surface. The CVN transfer channel shows promising prospect for producing neutron-rich superheavy nuclei. In this case, we also investigated the angular distributions of products from the CVN transfer channel in the reaction $^{238}$U + $^{238}$U with Tip-Side configuration, and the optimal detection angles are predicted.</description>

      <title>$f$ and $p$ mode oscillation of proto-neutron stars with systematic variation of the nucleon effective mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop equation of state (EoS) of proto-neutron stars (PNSs) at various stages of evolution by varying entropy per baryon $S$, using the Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU density functional model. Under the conditions of finite temperature and density, we systematically investigate the influence of nucleon effective mass on EoS of PNSs, for different values of isoscalar effective mass $\mu_S^*$. For high entropy values, we aim to replicate conditions of failed core-collapse supernovae forming black holes. At each stage of evolution, structural and non-radial oscillation (fundamental $f$-mode and first pressure $p_1$-mode) properties are computed under isentropic conditions by varying $\mu_S^*$. We focus on the effects of $S$ and $\mu_S^*$ on oscillation frequencies $f_f$ and $f_{p_1}$ adopting complete general relativistic formalism and Cowling approximation. Thermal effects reduce the values of $f_f$ and $f_{p_1}$ of PNSs compared to those of cold NSs, consequently detection of the former gets facilitated. For high-mass PNSs, this reduction is more pronounced for $f_{p_1}$ than $f_f$. Moreover, lower values of $\mu_S^*$ reduce $f_f$ and $f_{p_1}$ further. Universality of mass-scaled angular frequency ($\omega_fM$) with compactness ($C$) and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) are obtained as non-linear fits that shift upwards (downwards) in $\omega_fM-C$ ($\omega_fM-\Lambda$) plane for increasing values of $S$. For fixed $S$, the universality is also retained for variation of $\mu_S^*$. $S$ shows stronger correlation than $\mu_S^*$ with structural and oscillation properties of (P)NSs. Strength of correlation of $S$ is more prominent with $f_{p_1}$ than $f_f$ while the trend is opposite for $\mu_S^*$. These findings suggest that detection of oscillation frequencies by upcoming GW detectors, could potentially indicate the evolutionary stage of a star during its transition from supernova to cold NS.</description>

      <title>Exact Treatment of Continuum Couplings in Nuclear Optical Potentials via Feshbach Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first numerically exact implementation of full-coupling Feshbach theory for deriving effective optical potentials in nuclear reactions, overcoming long-standing computational barriers that previously necessitated weak-coupling approximations. By integrating Feshbach projection operators with the Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels (CDCC) method, we rigorously incorporate all continuum-continuum interactions, previously considered intractable, to extract dynamic polarization potentials that capture virtual excitations and absorption in reactions with weakly bound nuclei. Application to deuteron-induced reactions on $^{58}$Ni demonstrates that our full-coupling effective potentials reproduce CDCC observables exactly, while weak-coupling and folding-model approaches show significant deviations. The method uniquely separates elastic breakup from breakup-fusion processes through the optical theorem, enabling precise determination of incomplete and complete fusion cross sections, critical for interpreting rare-isotope beam experiments at facilities like FRIB. The non-local polarization potentials provide insights into the energy-dependent interplay between reaction mechanisms, with our analysis suggesting an increasing relative importance of elastic breakup at higher energies while continuum absorption shows more complex behavior. This exact treatment eliminates systematic uncertainties from coupling approximations, providing predictive power for unstable nuclei far from stability where experimental data are scarce.</description>

      <title>Thermo-coalescence model for Light Nuclei production in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a hybrid approach to describe the light nuclei production mechanism where the nucleons are assumed to be thermally produced, and are allowed to form light nuclei using a coalescence prescription. In this approach, we first fit transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) distribution of nucleons using hydro-inspired boost-invariant blast-wave model. The extracted parameters are then used to describe the deuteron $p_{T}$ spectra, along with two additional parameters that characterize the coalescence prescription employed in this study. We refer this combined approach as ``thermo-coalescence model'' and it is designed to study the deuteron production and describe the experimental measurements. In this work, we analyze the measured $p_{T}$ distribution of protons and deuterons from Pb-Pb collisions at the ALICE Collaboration at LHC. We also evaluate the $p_{T}$-integrated deuteron yields using this approach and compare with experimental measurements. A Bayesian inference framework is employed to determine the best-fit parameters of the thermo-coalescence model. Finally, we estimate the traditionally used experimental coalescence parameter ($B_{A}$) within our framework in order to establish a connection between our model and the conventional coalescence approach commonly used to relate experimental data with theoretical descriptions of light nuclei production.</description>

      <title>Antikaon absorption in the nuclear medium: the role of hadron self-energies and implications for kaonic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic study of all relevant in-medium effects on the total $K^-$-nuclear potential is presented in this work. The $K^-N$ scattering amplitudes, including Pauli blocking effects and hadron self-energies (hyperons, nucleons, pions and kaons), are derived within a next-to-leading order chiral meson-baryon coupled-channel interaction model. These amplitudes are employed in a microscopic model of the $K^-$-nuclear potential in symmetric nuclear matter that includes one-, two- and, when the kaons and pions are dressed, also multi-nucleon absorption processes. The potential is then applied in calculations of the strong energy shifts and widths of 64 measured kaonic atom levels. The comparison of the results of the full model that includes Pauli correlations and hadron self-energies with data provides $\chi^2 /d.p=1.5$, the lowest value obtained by a theoretical model to date and comparable with that of the best fitted phenomenological potentials. Furthermore, the calculated branching ratios for mesonic and non-mesonic absorption channels in kaonic carbon and kaonic neon are in good agreement with available data.</description>

      <title>Proton-proton scattering on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering of charged particles is ubiquitous in nuclear physics. We calculate the proton-proton $s$-wave phase shift at low energy relevant to solar physics. The phase shift is calculated from the ratio of the regular and irregular solutions to the radial Schr\"odinger equation on a hard spherical wall boundary for the ground state. The ground state energy is calculated using a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm. A theory with short-ranged nuclear interaction in the presence of the long-ranged Coulomb force is used to describe the scattering. The theory is discretized on a spatial lattice for adaptation to the quantum computer in the second quantized language. The phase shifts at low momenta are accurately reproduced.</description>

      <title>The excited state of the $\alpha$-particle: a benchmark study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A benchmark study is performed for the excited state of $^4$He. When the Coulomb interaction is switched off, the $^4$He nucleus exhibits a bound excited state in the vicinity of $p-{}^3$H threshold. As the Coulomb interaction is gradually introduced, the excited state crosses the threshold and eventually becomes a resonant state.
  Using three numerical methods, we track the evolution of this excited state and determine the resonance energy and width. Comparisons of the theoretical predictions reveal a significant discrepancy with commonly used $R$-matrix values based on the analysis of the experimental data. We explain the origin for this discrepancy. Additionally, the two-level energy spectrum of $^4$He in the absence of the Coulomb force exhibits characteristics linked to Efimov physics, suggesting a reduced sensitivity to interaction details.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of the Longitudinal Momentum-Transfer Component and Kinematic Factors in a diffraction approach for H(d,p)X Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, within the framework of the Glauber-Sitenko approximation, an analysis of the differential cross section for deuteron breakup into a proton in the reaction H(d,p)X is presented. The study is carried out using various parameterizations of the deuteron wave function, including the single-Gaussian parametrization, the multi-Gaussian K2 parametrization, and models based on the Av18 and NijmI nucleon-nucleon potentials. Special attention is given to the effects of small longitudinal components of the transferred momentum (Qz &lt; 0.5 GeV/c) and the transverse momentum of the proton-neutron pair (p_perp &lt; 0.5 GeV/c) in the anti-laboratory reference frame. The results are compared with experimental data, particularly in the region of longitudinal momenta p\_3 = 0.25-0.5 GeV/c, where quark effects are expected to manifest. Preliminary estimates show a decrease in the cross section with increasing transverse momentum, as well as a relatively small shift (and growth) of the cross-section maximum due to the inclusion of the longitudinal component Qz.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

      <title>Puzzle for the Vector Meson Threshold Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-statistics total cross sections for the vector meson photoproduction at the threshold: $\gamma p\to\omega p$ (from A2 at MAMI, ELPH, and CBELSA/TAPS), $\gamma p\to \phi p$ (from CLAS and LEPS), and $\gamma p\to J/\psi p$ (from GlueX) allow one to extract the absolute value of vector meson nucleon scattering length using Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) model. The ``young'' vector meson hypothesis may explain the fact that the obtained scattering length value for the nucleon $\phi$-meson compared to the typical hadron size of approximately $\sim1~\mathrm{fm}$ indicates that the proton is more transparent for the $\phi$-meson compared to the $\omega$-meson and is much less transparent than the $J/\psi$-meson. The extended analysis of $\Upsilon$-meson photoproduction using quasi-data from the QCD approach is in perfect agreement with the light-meson findings using experimental data.
  Future high-quality experiments by EIC and EicC will have the opportunity to evaluate cases for $J/\psi$- and $\Upsilon$-mesons. It allows one to understand the dynamics of $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ production at the threshold. The ability of J-PARC to measure $\pi^- p\to \phi n$ and $\pi^-p\to J/\psi n$, which are free from the VMD model, is considered.</description>

      <title>Lack of collisional hydrodynamics in a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we study the dipole compression collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas in the crossover from weak to strong repulsive interactions. In the uniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model, while the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous predictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which yields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating signal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore, we find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature phononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature increases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value characteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This crossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above which the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains the absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing open question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where integrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal intricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations, dynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic, nuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar anomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We present continuum-estimated $(2+1)$-flavor lattice QCD results for the leading-order Taylor expansion coefficients of the equation of state in strong magnetic fields and at nonzero baryon chemical potential. Simulations employ the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action with physical pion masses on lattices of temporal extent $N_\tau = 8,\,12$, covering $145 \lesssim T \lesssim 165~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $eB \lesssim 0.8~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, imposing strangeness neutrality with baseline results at electric charge to baryon number ratio $r = 0.4$. We determine the $T$--$eB$ dependence of $q_1$ and $s_1$ (electric charge and strangeness chemical potential ratios), pressure coefficient $P_2$, baryon number density coefficient $N_1^{\rm B}$, and energy-like coefficients $\Theta_2$ (trace anomaly), $\epsilon_2$ (energy density), and $\sigma_2$ (entropy density). Magnetic fields induce temperature-band crossings for $q_1$ and $P_2$ and non-monotonic structures in the energy-like coefficients, with $\Theta_2$ at strong fields possibly vanishing or turning negative at higher $T$, indicating dominance of the pressure term over the energy contribution. We also examine the $r$-dependence, finding that $r=0$ (charge-neutral matter) shows the most muted magnetic-field enhancement of $P_2$ despite larger $|q_1|$, providing a useful reference for neutron-star-like conditions. Comparisons with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model show qualitative agreement at low $T$ and weak $eB$, with clear deviations near the crossover and at strong fields. These results provide useful input for constraining models and effective theories of QCD matter in strong magnetic fields at finite baryon density.</description>

      <title>Vector meson dominance in photon structure functions at small $x$ from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the photon structure functions via the photon-photon and photon-vector meson scattering within the framework of holographic QCD, focusing on the small Bjorken $x$ region and assuming that the Pomeron exchange dominates. The quasi-real photon structure functions are formulated as the convolution of the known U(1) vector field wave function with the Brower-Polchinski-Strassler-Tan (BPST) Pomeron exchange kernel in the five-dimensional AdS space. Assuming the vector meson dominance, the photon structure functions can be calculated in a different way with the BPST kernel and vector meson gravitational form factor, which can be obtained in a bottom-up AdS/QCD model, for the Pomeron-vector meson coupling. It is shown that the obtained $F_2$ structure functions in the both ways agree with the experimental data, which implies the realization of the vector meson dominance within the present model setup. Calculations for the longitudinal structure function and the longitudinal-to-transverse ratio are also presented.</description>

      <title>Topological Strings in SU(3) Gauge Theory at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate string configurations in the deconfined phase of SU(3) gauge theory, which arise from the spontaneous breaking of the $Z_3$ center symmetry. These configurations form at the junctions of domain walls of the theory. The complex phase of the Polyakov loop changes by multiples of $2\pi$ on large spatial loops around the string, rendering them topologically stable. Using the Monte Carlo simulations of the partition function, we compute the free energy associated with these configurations. The simulations are performed on lattices with spatial dimensions $N_{x,y}=60, N_z=4$, and temporal extent $N_\tau=2$. Our results show that the free energy of the $Z_3-$strings is dominated by the domain walls. Further near the transition point, thermal fluctuations cause the decay of domain walls as well as the $Z_3$ strings into confined-deconfined interfaces.</description>

      <title>Chiral enhancement in soft-photon bremsstrahlung and charge asymmetry in low-energy lepton-proton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out a Lorentz gauge evaluation of the single-soft photon bremsstrahlung radiative corrections to the unpolarized elastic lepton-proton scattering cross section at low energies using the framework of heavy baryon chiral effective field theory (HB$\chi$PT). We systematically incorporate all next-to-leading order [i.e., ${\mathcal O}(\alpha^3/M)$] contributions to the cross section arising from radiative and proton's low-energy recoil effects. An important component of the soft-photon bremsstrahlung corrections arises from the interference between lepton and proton bremsstrahlung processes, which are characterized as charge-odd. We identify a class of Feynman diagrams involving the final-state radiating proton that induces a chiral enhancement, thereby modifying the naive amplitude hierarchy based on the standard chiral power-counting scheme. The recently derived HB$\chi$PT result for the analytically computed exact two-photon exchange (TPE) counterpart at NLO is combined with our charge-odd soft-photon bremsstrahlung contribution to yield the complete charge-odd radiative correction. By incorporating the leading hadronic correction to the leading order Born one-photon exchange (OPE) process within the charge-even radiative correction, we obtain a prediction for the charge asymmetry observable, which can be compared with forthcoming MUSE data on elastic lepton-anti-lepton scattering off the proton. In all our calculations, we use finite lepton masses.</description>

Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Possibility of quantum Hall effect in dense quark matter environments: A chiral model approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high baryon density and strong magnetic fields are expected in peripheral collisions in heavy ion collision experiments, such as the upcoming CBM experiment at FAIR in Germany and NICA in Russia. Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. We employed the chiral effective model to obtain the constituent quark mass in this non-perturbative QCD regime. A quantized version of conductivity and resistivity is found reliable in the quantum domain of low density and high magnetic fields. Landau quantization gives rise to phenomena similar to SdH oscillations and quantum Hall effect in this regime. We have used a density-dependent magnetic field to observe SdH-type oscillations and the possibility of the quantum Hall effect in the interior of neutron stars where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density. Our results indicate the possibility of observing the quantum Hall effect in a neutron star environment.</description>

Abstract: In nuclei with an odd nucleon number the non-vanishing spin number density is the source of a pseudo-magnetic field, which favors the splitting of the nucleon Cooper pairs. Such an pseudo-magnetic field is generated always in the dynamics of any nucleus, but its effects on Cooper pairs is significantly enhanced in the dynamic evolution of nuclei with an odd number of nucleons. We present for the first time a microscopic study of the induced fission of the odd neutron compound nuclei $^{239}$U, $^{241, 243}$Pu, and the odd proton, odd neutron compound nucleus $^{238}$Np, performed within the time-dependent density functional theory extended to superfluid fermion systems, without any simplifying assumptions and with controlled numerical approximations, and for a very large number of initial conditions. Due to the presence of the unpaired odd nucleon(s), the time-reversal symmetry of the fission compound nucleus is spontaneously broken, an aspect routinely neglected in the most advanced microscopic approaches of the past. The emerging fission fragment properties are quite similar to the properties of fission fragments of neighboring even-even nuclei. The time from saddle-to-scission is often significantly longer in odd-N-odd-Z or odd-A nuclei than for even-even nuclei since systems with unpaired nucleons are easier to excite and the potential energy surfaces of these nuclei have more structure, often resembling a very complicated obstacle course, rather than a more direct evolution of the nuclear shape from the top of the outer fission barrier to the scission configuration. The Pauli blocking approximation, often invoked in the literature, expected to inhibit the fission of nuclei with unpaired nucleons, is surprisingly strongly violated during the fission dynamics.</description>

      <title>HFB3: an axial HFB solver with Gogny forces using a 2-center HO basis (C++/Python)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The HFB3 program solves the axial nuclear Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations using bases formed by either one or two sets of deformed Harmonic Oscillator (HO) solutions with D1-type and D2-type Gogny effective nucleon-nucleon interactions. Using two sets of HO solutions shifted along the z-axis (2-center basis) allows to accurately describe highly elongated nuclear systems while keeping a moderate basis size, making this type of basis very convenient for the description of the nuclear fission process. For the description of odd-even and odd-odd systems, the equal-filling-approximation is used. Several observables can be calculated by the program, including the mean values of the multipole moments, nuclear radii, inertia tensors following Adiabatic Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) or Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) prescriptions, local and non-local one-body densities, local and non-local pairing densities, some fission fragment properties, etc. The program can ensure that the mean values associated with some specific operators take pre-defined values (constraints). Such constraints can be set on the usual multipole moments (for protons, neutrons or total mass). This program can be used as a monoprocess and monothreaded CLI executable, or through full-featured Python bindings (available through the Python Package Index PyPI).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a causality analysis on the dispersion relation of hydrodynamics with spin well as shear and bulk viscosity, including the relaxation times for all these quantities. We find that the interplay of the three relaxational scales, for shear and bulk viscosity as well as polarization, leads to non-trivial effects on the dispersion relation. Unexpectedly, the presence of polarization leads to lower effective viscosity and a longer relaxation time, and the presence of viscosity leads to lower limits as well as upper ones on the group velocity and constraints relating polarization to viscosity relaxation times. We conclude with a qualitative discussion on how these results impact phenomenology, specifically the low effective viscosity in strongly interacting matter as well as shear-vorticity coupling.</description>

Abstract: Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as confirmed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysis of inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential, constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely.</description>

      <title>Long-Range $N-J/\psi$ Interaction from an Operator Product Expansion Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent lattice QCD study has shown that the $N-J/\psi$ potential is attractive at all distances, and its long-range tail is well described by two-pion exchange. Here, we study to what extent the long-range part of the attraction can be reproduced from the perspective of the operator product expansion (OPE). This is accomplished by extracting the leading-order four-quark operator that couples to two pions and calculating its contribution to the $J/\psi$ mass in nuclear matter, to linear order in density, within the QCD sum rule framework. Using previous estimates of the four-quark operators for the chiral symmetric and breaking parts, we obtain a mass decrease that is smaller in magnitude but qualitatively consistent with the attraction obtained in the lattice QCD calculation. By expressing the interaction in terms of four-quark operators, we can analyze the effects of chiral symmetry restoration in dense matter on the masses of the $J/\psi$ and other mesons composed of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net charge carriers emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the transport variables in hydrodynamic domain. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature and Lorenz number $L_{0}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2}$. The validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law can be checked by evaluating the Lorenz ratio, which is expected to be unity. We investigate the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law by examining whether the Lorenz ratio equals unity or deviates from it. Our findings indicate that, within the fluid-based framework, the Lorenz ratio consistently leads to a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. This is attributed to the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per net charge carriers in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene and quark-gluon plasma, both systems at a low net carrier density, violate the Wiedemann-Franz law due to their fluidic nature. However, graphene at a relatively high net carrier density obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or electron density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high carrier density. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of quark-gluon plasma at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic Matter and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility experiments.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of proton using flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanical properties of the proton by extracting its flavor-decomposed gravitational form factors (GFFs) using Light-Cone QCD sum rules (LCSR). These form factors encode critical information about the internal dynamics and spatial distribution of energy, momentum, and internal forces within the proton. The flavor decomposition of the quark sector indicates the role of each flavor in the proton's pressure and shear force distributions. Our results show that the up quark contributes more significantly compared to the down quark in the three conserved proton GFFs, as well as in the energy and shear force distributions. Additionally, we define the non-conserved form factor $\bar{c}^q (t)$, which takes part in the distributions of energy and pressure; the latter is essential for maintaining proton stability. Furthermore, we determine the proton's mass and mechanical radii, providing valuable insight into its internal structure and dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the general analytic solution space for relativistic $(1+1)$-dimensional hydrodynamics for a perfect fluid flowing along the longitudinal direction. We work out the explicit one-parameter family of interpolating flows between boost-invariant and boost-non-invariant regimes, where a direct and simple dialing of the parameter at the level of solutions is possible. We also discuss the construction of generalised rapidity distribution of entropy for such interpolating flows at the level of potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy proton-nucleus (pA) collisions offer valuable insight into the role of cold nuclear matter effects in hadron production. In particular, multiple rescatterings of an incoming parton by the nuclear target are known to induce the radiation of many soft gluons. Hadron production is affected by fully coherent energy loss (FCEL), owing to those radiated gluons with a long formation time. Here we present a recently derived formula for the induced single soft gluon radiation spectrum beyond leading logarithmic accuracy, whose main features are demonstrated with the example of $q\, g \to q\, g$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Moat regimes within a $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-quark-meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To better understand recent predictions on the moat regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter, this paper extends the previous work within the two-flavor quark-meson (QM) model to the more realistic $2+1$ flavor Polyakov-quark-meson (PQM) model. Mainly, two effects are further taken into account: strange quark and confinement coded through Polyakov loop. Model parameters are chosen to consistently reproduce the pseudocritical temperature from lattice QCD, $T_{\rm C}\sim 156~ {\rm MeV}$, and the baryon chemical potential at the critical end point (CEP) from FRG-QCD, $\mu_{\rm B(CEP)}\sim 635~ {\rm MeV}$. It is found that the basic features of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons remain similar to those from QM model: Moat regimes cover the region where temperature or baryon chemical potential is large; reentrances occur around the critical baryon chemical potential of chiral transition at zero temperature. Thus, the FRG-QCD results can still not be well understood, especially why the CEP should locate at the entrances of moat regimes for $\sigma$ and $\pi$ mesons. Nevertheless, some basic features can be understood qualitatively, and it is consistent that the pole energies are increasing functions of momenta in the whole $T-\mu_{\rm B}$ plane. The moat regime and pole energy of $K$ mesons are also studied with the features similar.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Kadanoff-Baym formalism, we perform a detailed study of neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from strongly magnetized, dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. Starting from an exact expression for the emission rate that fully accounts for Landau-level quantization of quarks, we derive an approximate formula applicable in the regime where quark chemical potentials are much larger than all other relevant energy scales. We demonstrate that the emission rate is largely controlled by a single dimensionless ratio between two low-energy scales: the Landau-level spacing at the Fermi surface, $|e_f B|/\mu_{f}$, and the temperature of the quark matter, $T$. When the ratio $|e_f B|/(\mu_{f} T)$ approaches zero, many closely spaced Landau levels contribute to the emission, but the total rate vanishes as $B\to 0$. In the opposite limit, where the ratio is large, the rate is dominated by transitions between adjacent levels and is exponentially suppressed due to Landau-level quantization, which limits the thermal activation of quarks near the Fermi surface. Our results show that, even in the presence of the strongest magnetic fields expected in compact stars, the synchrotron emission remains suppressed by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to the direct Urca process. This implies that such emission is unlikely to play any substantial role in the cooling of magnetized quark stars, at least those made of unpaired quark matter phases.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $\Sigma^*$ via isospin selective reaction $K_Lp \to \pi^+\Sigma^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isospin-selective reaction $K_Lp \to \pi^+\Sigma^0$ provides a clean probe for investigating $I=1$ $\Sigma^*$ resonances. In this work, we perform an analysis of this reaction using an effective Lagrangian approach for the first time, incorporating the well-established $\Sigma(1189) 1/2^+$, $\Sigma(1385) 3/2^+$, $\Sigma(1670) 3/2^-$, $\Sigma(1775) 5/2^-$ states, while also exploring contributions from other unestablished states. By fitting the available differential cross section and recoil polarization data, adhering to partial-wave phase conventions same as PDG, we find that besides the established resonances, contributions from $\Sigma(1660) 1/2^+$, $\Sigma(1580) 3/2^-$ and a $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ improve the description. Notably, a $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ resonance with mass around 1.54 GeV, consistent with $\Sigma(1620)1/2^-$, is found to be essential for describing the data in this channel, a stronger indication than found in previous analyses focusing on $\pi\Lambda$ final states. While providing complementary support for $\Sigma(1660) 1/2^+$ and $\Sigma(1580) 3/2^-$, our results highlight the importance of the $\Sigma(1620) 1/2^-$ region in $K_Lp \to \pi^+\Sigma^0$. Future high-precision measurements are needed to solidify these findings and further constrain the $\Sigma^*$ spectrum.</description>

      <title>A modern Fortran library for SU(3) coupling and recoupling coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The group $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ has applications in several branches of physics. Many of these applications depend on availability of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ coupling and recoupling coefficients. We have developed a modern Fortran library for calculation of the coupling coefficients, for both the $\mathrm{SU}(3)\supset\mathrm{U}(1)\times\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)\supset\mathrm{SO}(3)$ group chains, and the recoupling coefficients. The library implements the algorithms of Draayer, Akiyama, and Millener, which are laid out in the paper. Performance of the library has been tested and compared to the Akiyama-Draayer (AD) library implementing the same algorithms as well as to a more recent implementation. Our library works for a larger range of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ quantum numbers and provides more accurate coupling coefficients with large quantum numbers than the AD library.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced production of the exotic charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ off nuclear targets and its internal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility to study the famous charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ production off nuclear targets and its properties in inclusive photon-induced reactions near the kinematic threshold within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for its charged components $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production in direct photon-nucleon interactions as well as three different popular scenarios for their internal structures: compact tetraquarks, molecules of the two open-charm mesons and mixtures of both of them. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for production of $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ mesons on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at initial photon energies of 9.0-17.5 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections and their ratios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$-10$^{\circ}$ and at photon energy of 14 GeV as well as the A-dependences of the ratios of the total cross sections for $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production at photon energy of 14 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures which are by far the best known. Hence, they might be useful for the determination of these structures -- the issue which has attracted much attention in the hadron physics community -- from the comparison of them with the experimental data from the future high-precision experiments at the CEBAF facility.</description>
