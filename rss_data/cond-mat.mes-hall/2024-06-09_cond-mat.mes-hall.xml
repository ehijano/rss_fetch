      <title>Long-distance decay-less spin transport in indirect excitons in a van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to its fundamental interest, the long-distance spin transport with suppressed spin losses is essential for spintronic devices. However, the spin relaxation caused by scattering of the particles carrying the spin, limits the spin transport. We explored spatially indirect excitons (IXs), also known as interlayer excitons, in van der Waals heterostructures (HS) composed of atomically thin layers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD) as spin carries. TMD HS also offer coupling of spin and valley transport. We observed the long-distance spin transport with the decay distances exceeding 100~$\mu$m and diverging so spin currents show no decay in the HS. With increasing IX density, we observed spin localization, then long-distance spin transport, and then reentrant spin localization, in agreement with the Bose-Hubbard theory prediction for superfluid and insulating phases in periodic potentials due to moir\'e superlattices. The suppression of scattering in exciton superfluid suppresses the spin relaxation and enables the long-distance spin transport. This mechanism of protection against the spin relaxation makes IXs a platform for the realization of long-distance decay-less spin transport.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Control of Rashba Interactions in a TMDC Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin relaxation dynamics of interlayer excitons in a MoSe2/MoS2 heterostructure induced by the Rashba effect. In such a system, Rashba interactions arise from an out-of-plane electric field due to photo-generated interlayer excitons inducing a phonon-assisted intravalley spin relaxation. We develop a theoretical description based on a microscopic approach to quantify the magnitude of Rashba interactions and test these predictions via time-resolved Kerr rotation measurements. In agreement with the calculations, we find that the Rashba-induced intravalley spin mixing becomes the dominating spin relaxation channel above T = 50 K. Our work identifies a previously unexplored spin-depolarization channel in heterostructures which can be used for ultrafast spin manipulation.</description>

      <title>Selective temperature sensing in nanodiamonds using dressed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature sensing at the nanoscale is a significant experimental challenge. Here, we report an approach using dressed states to make a leading quantum sensor (the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond) selectively sensitive to temperature, even in the presence of normally-confounding magnetic fields. Using an experimentally straightforward approach, we are able to suppress the magnetic sensitivity of the NV center by a factor of seven while retaining full temperature sensitivity and narrowing the NV center linewidth. These results demonstrate the power of engineering the sensor Hamiltonian using external control fields to enable sensing with improved specificity to target signals.</description>

      <title>Photon emission by hot electron injection across a lateral \textit{pn} junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method to generate photons by injecting hot electrons into a {\it pn} junction within a \ce{GaAs/AlGaAs} heterostructure. Hot electrons are generated by biasing across a mesoscopic potential in {\it n}-type region and travel toward {\it p}-type region through quantum Hall edge channel in the presence of magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate. The {\it p}-type region is created several microns away from the hot electron emitter by inducing interfacial charges using a surface gate. The energy relaxation of the hot electrons is suppressed by separating the orbitals before and after longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon emission. This technique enables the hot electrons to reach the {\it p}-type region and to recombine with induced holes followed by photon emissions. Hot electron-induced hole recombination is confirmed by a peak around \qty{810}{nm} in an optical spectrum that corresponds to excitonic recombination in a \ce{GaAs} quantum well. An asymmetric structure observed in the optical spectrum as a function of the magnetic field originates from the chiral transport of the hot electrons in the Hall edge channel. We propose the combination of our technology and on-demand single-electron source would enable the development of an on-demand single photon source that is an essential building block to drive an optical quantum circuit and to transfer quantum information for a long distance.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetotrion-polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field is a powerful tool for the manipulation of material's electronic and optical properties. In the domain of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers, it allows one to unveil the spin, valley, and orbital properties of many-body excitonic complexes. Here we study theoretically the impact of normal-to-plane magnetic field on trions and trion-polaritons. We demonstrate that spin and orbital effects of a magnetic field give comparable contributions to the trion energies. Moreover, as magnetic field redistributes the free electron gas between two valleys in the conductance band, the trion-photon coupling becomes polarization and valley dependent. This results in an effective giant Zeeman splitting of trion-polaritons, in-line with the recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Built-in Bernal gap in large-angle-twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin materials offer multiple opportunities for layer-by-layer control of their electronic properties. While monolayer graphene (MLG) is a zero-gap system, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) acquires a finite band gap when the symmetry between the layers' potential energy is broken, usually, via a large electric field applied in double-gate devices. Here, we introduce an asymmetric twistronic stack comprising both MLG and BLG, synthesized via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LP-CVD) on Cu. Although a large ($\sim30^{\circ}$) twist angle decouples the MLG and BLG electronic bands near Fermi level, we find that the layer degeneracy in the BLG subsystem is lifted, producing a gap in the absence of external fields. The built-in interlayer asymmetry originates from proximity-induced energy shifts in the outermost layers and requires a displacement field of $0.14$ V/nm to be compensated. The latter corresponds to a $\sim10$ meV intrinsic BLG gap, a value confirmed by our thermal-activation measurements. The present results highlight the role of structural asymmetry and encapsulating environment, expanding the engineering toolbox for monolithically-grown graphene multilayers.</description>

      <title>Observation of higher-order time-dislocation topological modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological dislocation modes resulting from the interplay between spatial dislocations and momentum-space topology have recently attracted significant interest. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate time-dislocation topological modes which are induced by the interplay between temporal dislocations and Floquet-band topology. By utilizing an extra physical dimension to represent the frequency-space lattice, we implement a two-dimensional Floquet higher-order topological phase and observe time-dislocation induced $\pi$-mode topological corner modes in a three-dimensional circuit metamaterial. Intriguingly, the realized time-dislocation topological modes exhibit spatial localization at the temporal dislocation, despite homogeneous in-plane lattice couplings across it. Our study opens a new avenue to explore the topological phenomena enabled by the interplay between real-space, time-space and momentum-space topology.</description>

      <title>Fully screened two-dimensional magnetoplasmons and rotational gravity shallow water waves in a rectangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study plasmons in a rectangular two-dimensional (2D) electron system in the vicinity of a planar metal electrode (gate) and in the presence of a perpendicular uniform magnetic field, using Maxwell's equations and neglecting retardation effects. The conductivity of the 2D system is characterized by the dynamical Drude model without taking collisional relaxation into account, which well describes both high mobility graphene and other field effect transistor structures, including quantum wells like Ga(Al)As, in the terahertz and in some cases sub-terahertz frequency ranges. Without a magnetic field, we analytically find the current distribution and frequency of plasma eigenmodes when the plasmon wavelength is much larger than the distance to the gate, i.e. in the fully screened limit. To find an approximate solution in a magnetic field, we expand current in the complete set of eigenmodes without magnetic fields. Analytical asymptotic expressions in weak and strong magnetic fields were obtained for the lower modes. Unlike the disk and stripe, the frequencies of these modes tend to zero as the magnetic field tends to infinity. We also discuss a direct analogy to rotational gravity shallow water waves, where size-quantized Poincare waves correspond to size-quantized magnetoplasmons, while Kelvin waves correspond to edge magnetoplasmons.</description>

      <title>Entangled magnon-pair generation in a driven synthetic antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding, manipulating, and using magnons - the quanta of spin waves - for energy-efficient applications is one of the primary goals of magnonics. In this paper, we consider a synthetic antiferromagnet in which one of the ferromagnetic layers is driven by spin-orbit torque. We find that under specific conditions for the magnitude of the spin-orbit torque and field, magnon pairs are spontaneously produced by quantum fluctuations in a way that is similar to Hawking pair production near black-hole horizons. One of the magnons is generated near the interface with the spacer layer in one of the magnetic layers of the synthetic antiferromagnet, while the other magnon is produced in the other magnetic layer. We compute the magnon current due to these spontaneously generated magnon pairs and estimate the temperature below which they should become observable. Additionally, we find that the magnons are entangled, which makes them interesting for future applications in quantum magnonics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Schwinger Effect in Lead-Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe strong photoluminescence of a lead-halide perovskite driven by deep sub-gap irradiation. Using the quasi-adiabatic Landau-Dykhne approach, we interpret this observation in terms of the dynamical Schwinger effect -- tunneling ionization in strong fields. Further, the exponential sensitivity of the Schwinger effect to driving fields allows us to measure the local frozen-in fields in a nominally cubic MAPbBr$_3$ single crystal at room temperature. Finally, we demonstrate an AC analogue of biasing in our system -- the cooperation between two time-dependent fields simultaneously driving the sample. Our results (i) establish lead-halide perovskites as an excellent platform for simulating effects of strong fields on Dirac fields, (ii) contribute to the on-going discussion about inversion-breaking in MAPbBr$_3$ single crystal, and (iii) pave the way for a mid-infrared light detection with lead-halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Ohms law lost and regained: observation and impact of zeros and poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum conductance and its classical wave analogue, the transmittance, are given by the sum of the eigenvalues of the transmission matrix. The lowest transmission eigenvalue in diffusive media might be expected to play a negligible role in the conductance, and, in any case, to be too small to be observed. Here, we observe the lowest transmission eigenchannel in microwave waveguides, though it is orders of magnitude below the nominal noise level, and show that the transmittance is pulled down by global correlation among transmission eigenvalues and among zeros and poles of the transmission matrix. Transmission vanishes either when the energy density on the sample output vanishes at topological transmission zeros or when the longitudinal velocity vanishes precisely at the crossover to a new channel. This lowers the conductance by an amount proportional to the modulation of the density of states. In accord with the correspondence principle, the conductance approaches Ohms law as the number of channels increases with sample width. The exploration of the transmission matrix opens the door to a new understanding of mesoscopic transport and ultrasensitive detection techniques.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interactions mediated by a photonic flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20382v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.</description>

      <title>Vortex entropy and superconducting fluctuations in ultrathin underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortices in superconductors can help identify emergent phenomena but certain fundamental aspects of vortices, such as their entropy, remain poorly understood. Here, we study the vortex entropy in underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ by measuring both magneto-resistivity and Nernst effect on ultrathin flakes ($\le$2 unit-cell). We extract the London penetration depth from the magneto-transport measurements on samples with different doping levels. It reveals that the superfluid phase stiffness $\rho_s$ scales linearly with the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, down to the extremely underdoped case. On the same batch of ultrathin flakes, we measure the Nernst effect via on-chip thermometry. Together, we obtain the vortex entropy and find that it decays exponentially with $T_c$ or $\rho_s$. We further analyze the Nernst signal above $T_c$ in the framework of Gaussian superconducting fluctuations. The combination of electrical and thermoelectric measurements in the two-dimensional limit provides fresh insight into high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Xenon plasma-focused ion beam milling as a method to deterministically fabricate bright and high-purity single-photon sources operating at C-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron beam lithography is a standard method for fabricating photonic nanostructures around semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), which are crucial for efficient single and indistinguishable photon sources in quantum information processing. However, this technique lacks direct 3D control over the nanostructure shape, complicating the design and enlarging the 2D footprint to suppress in-plane photon leakage while directing photons into the collecting lens aperture. Here, we present an alternative approach to employ Xenon plasma-focused ion beam (Xe-PFIB) technology as a reliable method for the 3D shaping of photonic nanostructures containing low-density self-assembled InAs/InP quantum dots emitting in the C-band range of the 3rd telecommunication window. We explore both deterministic and non-deterministic fabrication approaches, resulting in mesas naturally shaped as truncated cones. As a demonstration, we fabricate mesas using a heterogeneously integrated structure with a QDs membrane atop an aluminum mirror and silicon substrate. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations show that the angled sidewalls significantly increase photon extraction efficiency, achieving {\eta} = 0.89 for NA = 0.65. We demonstrate experimentally a high purity of pulsed single-photon emission (~99%) and a high extraction efficiency of {\eta} = 0.24, with the latter surpassing the highest reported values obtained using electron beam lithography in the C-band.</description>

      <title>Encapsulated void resonators in lossy dielectric van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric optical resonators traditionally rely on materials with the combination of high refractive indices and low optical losses. Such materials are scarce for operation in visible spectrum and shorter wavelengths. This limitation can be circumvented by relaxing the requirement of low losses. We demonstrate that highly lossy dielectric materials can be structured to support optical resonances that confine light in air voids. We theoretically design void resonances in the visible spectrum and identify resonant modes supported by void arrays. Experimentally, we fabricate void arrays in tungsten diselenide and characterize the confined resonances using far-field reflectance measurements and scanning near-field optical microscopy. Using van der Waals heterostructure assembly, we encapsulate the voids with hexagonal boron nitride which reduces the void volume causing a large spectral blue shift of the void resonance exceeding 150 nm. Our work demonstrates a versatile optical platform for lossy materials, expanding the range of suitable materials and the spectral range of photonic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many of graphene's remarkable properties are intrinsically linked to its inherent ripples. Defects, whether naturally present or artificially introduced, are known to have a strong impact on the rippling of graphene. However, how defects alter ripple dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) materials in general, and graphene in particular, remains largely unexplored. Here, using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal a fundamental connection between defect concentration and ripple dynamics in freestanding graphene sheets. Specifically, we find that at a critical concentration of approximately 0.1%, dynamic rippling undergoes a transition from freely propagating to static ripples. This is in quantitative alignment with the experimentally observed turning point in the non-monotonic scaling of the Young's modulus and emphasises the critical interplay between defects and material dynamics. Our work not only unveils the significant impact of defects on rippling dynamics in graphene but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the quantum nature of high spin YSR excitations in transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitations of individual and coupled spins on superconductors provide a platform to study quantum spin impurity models as well as a pathway toward realizing topological quantum computing. Here, we characterize, using ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states of individual manganese phthalocyanine molecules with high spin character on the surface of an ultra-thin lead film in variable transverse magnetic field. We observe two types of YSR excitations, depending on the adsorption geometry of the molecule. Using a zero-bandwidth model, we detail the role of the magnetic anisotropy, spin-spin exchange, and Kondo exchange. We illustrate that one molecular type can be treated as an individual spin akin to an isolated spin on the metal center, whereas the other molecular type invokes a coupled spin system represented by a spin on the center and the ligand. Using the field-dependent evolution of the YSR excitations and comparisons to modeling, we describe the quantum phase of each of the molecules. These results provide an insight into the quantum nature of YSR excitations in magnetic field, and a platform to study spin impurity models on superconductors in magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Kondo Screening and Indirect Magnetic Exchange through a Conventional Superconductor Studied by the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between the Kondo screening and indirect magnetic exchange in systems with two magnetic impurities coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor gives rise to a nontrivial ground-state phase diagram. Here, we utilize the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method and exploit the non-abelian spin-SU(2) symmetry to study the phase diagram for two quantum-spin-$\frac12$ impurities locally exchange coupled to large one-dimensional chains. The nonlocal inter-impurity exchange is treated as an emergent Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling. We find qualitatively different phase diagrams for impurity spins coupled to sites with odd or even distances $d$ on the chain and a partial-Kondo-screened spin-doublet phase that extends over the whole range of local exchange couplings $J$ in the limit of weak superconducting pairing strength $\Delta$. Our numerical studies are complemented by exact diagonalization of small (quantum-box) systems and by perturbative-in-$J$ computations of the $d$ and $\Delta$ dependent RKKY interaction. It is thereby demonstrated that the specific system geometry is essential for our understanding of magnetic impurity interactions in superconducting hosts, and thus for insights into the control of quantum-state properties in nanoparticle systems and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of a two-dimensional non-relativistic electron gas (TDEG) constrained on wires along a M\"{o}bius strip. We considered wires around the strip and along the transverse direction, across the width of the strip. For each direction, we investigate how the curvature modifies the electronic states and their corresponding energy spectrum. At the center of the strip, the wires around the surface form quantum rings whose spectrum depends on the strip radius $a$. For wires at the edge of the strip, the inner edge turns into the outer edge. Accordingly, the curvature yields localized states in the middle of the wire. Along the strip width, the effective potential exhibits a parity symmetry breaking leading to the localization of the bound state on one side of the strip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices formed from twisting trilayers of graphene are an ideal model for studying electronic correlation, and offer several advantages over bilayer analogues, including more robust and tunable superconductivity and a wide range of twist angles associated with flat band formation. Atomic reconstruction, which strongly impacts the electronic structure of twisted graphene structures, has been suggested to play a major role in the relative versatility of superconductivity in trilayers. Here, we exploit an inteferometric 4D-STEM approach to image a wide range of trilayer graphene structures. Our results unveil a considerably different model for moir\'e lattice relaxation in trilayers than that proposed from previous measurements, informing a thorough understanding of how reconstruction modulates the atomic stacking symmetries crucial for establishing superconductivity and other correlated phases in twisted graphene trilayers.</description>

Abstract: Interferometers and beam splitters are fundamental building blocks for photonic neuromorphic and quantum computing machinery. In waveguide-based photonic integrated circuits, beam-splitting is achieved with directional couplers that rely on transition regions where the waveguides are adiabatically bent to suppress back-reflection. We present a novel, compact approach to introducing guided mode coupling. By leveraging multimodal domain walls between microwave topological photonic crystals, we use the photonic-spin-conservation to suppress back-reflection while relaxing the topological protection of the valley degree of freedom to implement tunable beam splitting. Rapid advancements in chip-scale topological photonics suggest that the proposed simultaneous utilization of multiple topological degrees of freedom could benefit the development of novel photonic computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Theory of intrinsic acoustic plasmons in twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the intrinsic plasmonic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) as a function of the twist angle $\theta$ (and other microscopic parameters such as temperature and filling factor). Our calculations, which rely on the random phase approximation, take into account four crucially important effects, which are treated on equal footing: i) the layer-pseudospin degree of freedom, ii) spatial non-locality of the density-density response function, iii) crystalline local field effects, and iv) Hartree self-consistency. We show that the plasmonic spectrum of TBG displays a smooth transition from a strongly-coupled regime (at twist angles $\theta \lesssim 2^{\circ}$), where the low-energy spectrum is dominated by a weakly dispersive intra-band plasmon, to a weakly-coupled regime (for twist angles $\theta \gtrsim 2^{\circ}$) where an acoustic plasmon clearly emerges. This crossover offers the possibility of realizing tunable mid-infrared sub-wavelength cavities, whose vacuum fluctuations may be used to manipulate the ground state of strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a systematic method to spectrally design quasi-one-dimensional crystal models described by the Dirac equation in the low-energy regime. The method is based on the supersymmetric transformation applied to an initially known pseudo-spin-1/2 model. This allows extending the corresponding susy partner so that the new model describes a pseudo-spin-1 system. The spectral design allows the introduction of a flat-band and discrete energies at will into the new model. The results are illustrated in two examples where the Su-Schriefer-Heeger chain is locally converted into a stub lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional localized topological solitons in the volume of a magnet. In this work, starting with a classical free energy density of a helimagnet, an approximate variational model of hopfions is studied. The hopfion stability regions on the uniaxial anisotropy-external magnetic field phase diagram are computed and their evolution with increasing magnetostatic interaction strength is considered. It is found that magnetostatic interaction destabilizes the hopfions and, above the certain strength (relative to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction), destroys their stability completely. Numerical estimates for this bound are provided. They can help focus the search for materials, supporting bulk magnetic hopfions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector magnetometry is an essential tool in characterizing the distribution of currents and magnetization in a broad range of systems. Point defect sensors, like the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond, have demonstrated impressive sensitivity and spatial resolution for detecting these fields. Measuring the vector field at a single point in space using single defects, however, remains an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate that careful optimization of the static bias field can enable simultaneous measurement of multiple magnetic field components with enhanced sensitivity by leveraging the nonlinear Zeeman shift from transverse magnetic fields. This work quantifies the trade-off between the increased frequency shift from second-order Zeeman effects with decreasing contrast as off-axis field components increase, demonstrating the measurement of multiple components of the magnetic field from an exemplar antiferromagnet with a complex magnetic texture.</description>

Abstract: The significance of mass spectrometry lies in its unparalleled ability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in complex samples, providing invaluable insights into molecular structures and interactions. Here, we leverage diamond nanostructures as highly sensitive mass sensors by utilizing a self-excitation mechanism under an electron beam in a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM). The diamond molecular balance (DMB) exhibits exceptional mass resolution of a few MDa and an extensive dynamic range from MDa to TDa, positioning itself as a forefront molecular balance operating at room temperature. Notably, the DMB measures the mass of a single bacteriophage T4, achieving a mass resolution of 4.7 MDa for an analyte at 184 MDa, while precisely determining their positional information on the device. These findings highlight the groundbreaking potential of the DMB as a revolutionary tool for mass analysis at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of magnetoresistance oscillations in layered quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) metals. Using the Kubo-Streda formula, we calculate the Hall intralayer conductivity in a magnetic field perpendicular to conducting layers. The analytical expressions for the amplitudes and phases of magnetic quantum oscillations (MQO) and of the difference or the so-called slow oscillations (SO) are derived as a function of several parameters: magnetic field strength, interlayer transfer integral, temperature, and the electron mean-free time. We calculate the quantum oscillations of the magnetoresistance tensor, because the magnetoresistance rather than conductivity is usually measured. We also discuss the averaging of magnetoresistance oscillations over MQO period due to finite temperature and long-range sample inhomogeneities. The results obtained are useful to analyze experimental data on magnetoresistance oscillations in various quasi-2D metals.</description>

Abstract: We examine neutrino zeromode solutions on the electroweak $Z$-string and their effect on the stability of the string in the standard model and its extensions. We propose using topological invariants constructed from the momentum (and real) space topology of Green's functions, often used for investigating edge modes in condensed matter physics. We analyze the standard model and then examine type-I and type-II extensions of the neutrino sector as well as their hybrid. Based on this analysis, we also comment on proposals in the literature to stabilize the $Z$-string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polariton condensates occur away from thermal equilibrium, in an open system where heat and particles are continually exchanged with reservoirs. These phenomena have been extensively analyzed in terms of kinetic equations. Based on the collection of knowledge about polariton kinetics provided by these simulations and by experimental works, we constructed a few-level model that captures the main processes involved in the buildup of a ground-state population of polaritons. This allows condensation to be understood as the output of a thermal machine and exposes the thermodynamic constraints on its occurrence. The model consists of a three-level system interacting with a field and connected to a hot and a cold thermal reservoir that represent a non-resonant pump and the lattice phonons. This subsystem can drive a condensate, through polariton-polariton scattering, which produces work in the form of coherent light emission from the microcavity. We obtain a phase diagram as a function of the temperatures of the two baths and investigate the possible types of phase transition that lead to the condensate phase.</description>

Abstract: Metallic ferromagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as important building blocks for scalable magnonics and memory applications. Downscaling such systems to the ultra-thin limit is critical to integrate them into technology. Here, we achieved layer-by-layer control over the transition metal dichalcogenide Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ by using pulsed laser deposition, and we uncovered the minimum critical thickness above which room temperature magnetic order is maintained. The electronic and magnetic structure is explored experimentally and theoretically and it is shown that the films exhibit strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy as a consequence of large spin-orbit effects. Our study elucidates both magnetic and electronic properties of Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$, and corroborates the importance of intercalation to tune the magnetic properties of nanoscale materials architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric field control of magnetic properties offers a broad and promising toolbox for enabling ultra-low power electronics. A key challenge with high technological relevance is to master the interplay between the magnetic anisotropy of a ferromagnet and the exchange coupling to an adjacent antiferromagnet. Here, we demonstrate that magneto-ionic gating can be used to achieve a very stable out-of-plane (OOP) oriented magnetization with strong exchange bias in samples with as-deposited preferred in-plane (IP) magnetization. We show that the perpendicular interfacial anisotropy can be increased by more than a factor 2 in the stack Ta/Pt/PtMn/Co/HfO2 by applying -2.5 V gate voltage over 3 nm HfO2, causing a reorientation of the magnetization from IP to OOP with a strong OOP exchange bias of more than 50 mT. Comparing two thicknesses of PtMn, we identify a notable trade-off: while thicker PtMn yields a significantly larger exchange bias, it also results in a slower response to ionic liquid gating within the accessible gate voltage window. These results pave the way for post-deposition electrical tailoring of magnetic anisotropy and exchange bias in samples requiring significant exchange bias.</description>

Abstract: Context: Due to advances in synthesizing lower dimensional materials there is the challenge of finding the wave equation that effectively describes quantum particles moving on 1D and 2D domains. Jensen and Koppe and Da Costa independently introduced a confining potential formalism showing that the effective constrained dynamics is subjected to a scalar geometry-induced potential; for the confinement to a curve, the potential depends on the curve's curvature function.
  Method: To characterize the $\pi$ electrons in polyenes, we follow two approaches. First, we utilize a weakened Coulomb potential associated with a spiral curve. The solution to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions yields Bessel functions, and the spectrum is obtained analytically. We employ the particle-in-a-box model in the second approach, incorporating effective mass corrections. The $\pi$-$\pi^*$ transitions of polyenes were calculated in good experimental agreement with both approaches, although with different wave functions.</description>

      <title>Capillary Flow Printing of Submicron Carbon Nanotube Transistors</title>

Abstract: Although printed transistors have a wide range of applications, the limited resolution of printing techniques (10-30 um) has been a barrier to advancement and scaling, particularly down to submicron dimensions. While previous works have shown creative approaches to realizing submicron channel lengths with printing, reliance on chemical processes unique to specific inks or tedious post-processing limit their applicability. Here, we report the use of capillary flow printing (CFP) to repeatably create fully printed submicron carbon nanotube thin-film transistors (CNT-TFTs) without chemical modification or physical manipulation post-printing. The versatility of this printing technique is demonstrated by printing conducting, semiconducting, and insulating inks on several types of substrates (SiO2, Kapton, and paper) and through the fabrication of various TFT device (contacting/gating) architectures. Notably, CFP of these CNT-TFTs yielded on-currents of 1.12 mA/mm when back gated on Si/SiO2, and 490 uA/mm when side gated through ion gel on Kapton, demonstrating the strong transistor performance achievable with CFP. Mechanical bending and sweep rate resilience of devices printed on Kapton show the wide utility of CFP-fabricated devices for flexible applications. This work highlights the ability of CFP as a viable fabrication method for submicron electronics through cleanroom-free printing techniques.</description>
