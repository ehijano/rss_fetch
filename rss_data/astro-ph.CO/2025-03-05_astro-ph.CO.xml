      <title>Lost in the FoG: Pitfalls of Models for Large-Scale Hydrogen Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Siren: Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Background Measurements of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from individually resolved compact object mergers can be used as standard sirens, offering a novel self-calibrating precision probe of cosmology. While the standard siren method has been well-explored, the gravitational-wave background arising from unresolved mergers offers a novel alternative to probing cosmology. We demonstrate that the combination of resolved binary black hole mergers with the unresolved signals composing the stochastic gravitational-wave background can be used to measure cosmological parameters, including the Hubble constant, $H_0$. We apply this ``stochastic siren'' method to existing gravitational-wave data and find that including the current non-detection of the background increases the accuracy at which $H_0$ can be measured, relative to using resolved mergers alone. We also provide projections for upcoming detectors to highlight their ability to probe cosmology with the background. With the anticipated detection of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background, the stochastic siren approach can be expected to improve future standard siren cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>DESI Spectroscopy of HETDEX Emission-line Candidates I: Line Discrimination Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hobby-Eberly Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) is an untargeted spectroscopic galaxy survey that uses Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) as tracers of 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 large scale structure. Most detections consist of a single emission line, whose identity is inferred via a Bayesian analysis of ancillary data. To determine the accuracy of these line identifications, HETDEX detections were observed with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In two DESI pointings, high confidence spectroscopic redshifts are obtained for 1157 sources, including 982 LAEs. The DESI spectra are used to evaluate the accuracy of the HETDEX object classifications, and tune the methodology to achieve the HETDEX science requirement of $\lesssim 2\%$ contamination of the LAE sample by low-redshift emission-line galaxies, while still assigning $96\%$ of the true Ly$\alpha$ emission sample with the correct spectroscopic redshift. We compare emission line measurements between the two experiments assuming a simple Gaussian line fitting model. Fitted values for the central wavelength of the emission line, the measured line flux and line widths are consistent between the surveys within uncertainties. Derived spectroscopic redshifts, from the two classification pipelines, when both agree as an LAE classification, are consistent to within $\langle \Delta z / (1 + z) \rangle = 6.9\times 10^{-5}$ with an rms scatter of $3.3\times 10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>The kinematic contribution to the cosmic number count dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the number count dipole with large surveys have shown amplitudes in tension with kinematic predictions based on the observed Doppler dipole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These observations seem to be in direct conflict with a homogeneous and isotropic Universe as asserted by the cosmological principle, demanding further investigation into the origin of the tension. Here, we investigate whether the observed number count dipoles are consistent with being fully kinematic or if there is any residual anisotropy contributing to the total observed dipole. To disentangle these contributions, we aim to leverage the fact that the kinematic matter dipole expected in a given galaxy catalogue scales with observed properties of the sample, and different catalogues used in the literature therefore have different kinematic dipole expectations. We here perform joint dipole fits using the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), and the AGN catalogue derived from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (CatWISE). Assuming a common kinematic and non-kinematic dipole component between all catalogues, we find that a large residual, non-kinematic dipole anisotropy is detected, though a common direction between the two components is disfavoured by model selection. Freeing up both amplitude and direction for this residual dipole while fixing the kinematic dipole to the CMB dipole expectation, we recover a significant residual dipole with $\mathcal{D}_{resid} = (0.81\pm0.14)\times10^{-2}$, that is offset from the CMB dipole direction by $39\pm8$ degrees. While the present work provides a valuable first test of this concept, its scrutinising power is limited by the currently employed catalogues. Larger catalogues, especially in radio, will be needed to further lift the degeneracy between the kinematic and residual dipole components.</description>

      <title>A New $\sim 5\sigma$ Tension at Characteristic Redshift from DESI DR1 and DES-SN5YR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts, $z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$ shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$ tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: View of the Fornax galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fornax cluster is one of the most nearby X-ray bright galaxy clusters. Previous observations of the intracluster medium were limited to less than R500. We aim to significantly extend the X-ray coverage. We use data from five SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys and perform a detailed one- and two-dimensional X-ray surface brightness analysis, allowing us to trace hot gas emission from kpc to Mpc scales with a single instrument. We compare the results to those from a recent numerical simulation of the local Universe (SLOW) and correlate the X-ray emission distribution with that of other tracers, including cluster member galaxies, ultra compact dwarf galaxies, intracluster globular clusters, and HI-tail galaxies. We detect X-ray emission out to well beyond the virial radius, R100=2.2 deg. We do not find obvious evidence for the bow shock several hundred kpc south of the cluster center predicted by previous numerical simulations of the Fornax cluster. Instead, we discover finger-like structures beyond R500 to the west and south-east that stretch out far beyond the virial radius. They might be due to gas being pushed outward by the previous merger with NGC 1404 or due to warm-hot gas infall along large-scale filaments. Intriguingly, we find the distributions of the other tracers -- galaxies and globular clusters -- to be correlated with the X-ray excess regions, favoring the latter infall scenario. Interestingly, we also discover an apparent Bridge of low surface brightness emission beyond the virial radius connecting to the Fornax A galaxy group, which is also traced by the member galaxy and globular cluster distribution. This X-ray Bridge furthermore approximately coincides with a region of enhanced Faraday depth detected previously. The gas distribution in the SLOW simulation shows similar features as those we have discovered with SRG/eROSITA.</description>

      <title>PAC in DESI. I. Galaxy Stellar Mass Function into the $10^{6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC) method integrates cosmological photometric and spectroscopic surveys, offering valuable insights into galaxy formation. PAC measures the excess surface density of photometric objects, $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$, with specific physical properties around spectroscopic tracers. In this study, we improve the PAC method to make it more rigorous and eliminate the need for redshift bins. We apply the enhanced PAC method to the DESI Y1 BGS Bright spectroscopic sample and the deep DECaLS photometric sample, obtaining $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements across the complete stellar mass range, from $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies, and from $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.9}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies. We combine $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ with $w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements from the BGS sample, which is not necessarily complete in stellar mass. Assuming that galaxy bias is primarily determined by stellar mass and colour, we derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) down to $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies and $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies, while also setting lower limits for smaller masses. The blue and red GSMFs are well described by single and double Schechter functions, respectively, with low-mass end slopes of $\alpha_{\rm{blue}}=-1.54^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{red}}=-2.50^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$, resulting in the dominance of red galaxies below $10^{7.6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Stage-IV cosmological photometric surveys, capable of reaching 2-3 magnitudes deeper than DECaLS, present an opportunity to explore the entire galaxy population in the local universe with PAC. This advancement allows us to address critical questions regarding the nature of dark matter, the physics of reionization, and the formation of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Star-formation efficiencies in high-redshift galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations hint at unexpectedly intense cosmic star-formation in the early Universe, often attributed to enhanced star-formation efficiencies (SFEs). Here, we analyze the SFE in THESAN-ZOOM, a novel zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamic simulation campaign of high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 3$) galaxies employing a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model resolving the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The halo-scale SFE ($\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$) - the fraction of baryons accreted by a halo that are converted to stars - follows a double power-law dependence on halo mass, with a mild redshift evolution above $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{9.5}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. The power-law slope is roughly $1/3$ at large halo masses, consistent with expectations when gas outflows are momentum-driven. At lower masses, the slope is roughly $2/3$ and is more aligned with the energy-driven outflow scenario. $\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$ is a factor of $2-3$ larger than commonly assumed in empirical galaxy-formation models at $M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{11}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. On galactic (kpc) scales, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation of neutral gas is universal in THESAN-ZOOM, following $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} \propto \Sigma_{\rm gas}^2$, indicative of a turbulent energy balance in the ISM maintained by stellar feedback. The rise of $\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$ with halo mass can be traced primarily to increasing gas surface densities in massive galaxies, while the underlying KS relation and neutral, star-forming gas fraction remain unchanged. Although the increase in $\epsilon^{\ast}_{\rm halo}$ with redshift is relatively modest, it is sufficient to explain the large observed number density of UV-bright galaxies at $z \gtrsim 12$. However, reproducing the brightest sources at $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21$ may require extrapolating the SFE beyond the halo mass range directly covered by THESAN-ZOOM.</description>

      <title>Inverse bubbles from broken supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon the recent findings regarding inverse phase transitions in the early universe, we present the first natural realisation of this phenomenon within a supersymmetry-breaking sector. We demonstrate that inverse hydrodynamics, which is characterized by the fluid being aspired by the bubble wall rather than being pushed or dragged, is actually not limited to a phase of (re)heating but can also occur within the standard cooling cosmology. Through a numerical analysis of the phase transition, we establish a simple and generic criterion to determine its hydrodynamics based on the generalised pseudo-trace. Our results provide a proof of principle highlighting the need to account for these new fluid solutions when considering cosmological phase transitions and their phenomenological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a covariant formalism to study the evolution of cosmological perturbations during a first-order phase transition, addressing in particular their gauge dependence that have been overlooked so far. Our results reveal that non-covariant treatments employed in previous studies can substantially overestimate the production of primordial black holes and scalar-induced gravitational waves. Once gauge dependencies are properly accounted for, we find that both effects occur at significantly lower levels than previously estimated.</description>

      <title>Can primordial black holes explain the overabundance of bright super-early galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is detecting an excess of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 10$), bright galaxies challenging most theoretical predictions. To address this issue, we investigate the impact of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) on the halo mass function and UV luminosity function (LF) of super-early galaxies. We explore two key effects: (i) the enhancement of massive halos abundance due to the compact nature and spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) the luminosity boost, characterized by the Eddington ratio $\lambda_E$, due to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) powered by matter accretion onto PBHs. We build an effective model, calibrated using data at lower redshifts ($z\approx 4-9$), to derive the evolution of the LF including the additional PBH contribution. Via Bayesian analysis, we find that: (a) Although a small fraction ($\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -5.42$) of massive ($\log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 8.37$), non-emitting ($\lambda_E=0$) PBHs can explain the galaxy excess via the halo abundance enhancement, this solution is excluded by CMB $\mu$-distortion constraints on monochromatic PBHs. (b) If PBHs power an AGN emitting at super-Eddington luminosity ($\lambda_E \approx 10$), the observed LF can be reproduced by a PBH population with characteristic mass $\log M_{\rm PBH} / {\rm M_{\odot}} \approx 3.69$ constituting a tiny ($\log f_{\rm PBH} \approx -8.16$) fraction of the cosmic dark matter content. In the AGN scenario, about 75% of the observed galaxies with ${\rm M_{UV}}=-21$ at $z=11$ should host a PBH-powered AGN and typically reside in low mass halos, $M_h = 10^{8-9} {\rm M_{\odot}}$. These predictions can be tested with available and forthcoming JWST spectroscopic data. We note that our analysis considers a lognormal PBH mass function and compares its parameters with monochromatic limits on PBH abundance. Further work is required to relax such limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the frequency and physical drivers of transformations from cool-core (CC) to non-cool-core (NCC) clusters, and vice versa, in a sample of 352 massive galaxy clusters (M_vir = 10^14-15.3 M_sun) from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation of galaxies. By identifying transformations based on the evolution of central entropy and focusing on z&lt;2.5, we find that clusters frequently undergo such events, depending on their assembly and supermassive black hole histories. On average, clusters experience 2 to 3 transformations. Transformations can occur in both directions and can be temporary, but those to higher entropy cores, i.e. in the direction from CC to NCC states, are the vast majority. CC phases are shorter than NCC phases, and thus overall the TNG-Cluster population forms with low-entropy cores and moves towards NCC states with time. We study the role that mergers play in driving transformations, and find that mergers within ~1Gyr prior to a transformation toward higher (but not lower) entropy cores occur statistically more often than in a random control sample. Most importantly, we find examples of mergers associated with CC disruption regardless of their mass ratio or angular momentum. However, past merger activity is not a good predictor for z=0 CC status, at least based on core entropy, even though clusters undergoing more mergers eventually have the highest core entropy values at z=0. We consider the interplay between AGN feedback and evolving cluster core thermodynamics. We find that core transformations are accompanied by an increase in AGN activity, whereby frequent and repeated (kinetic) energy injections from the central SMBHs can produce a collective, long-term impact on central entropy, ultimately heating cluster cores. Whether such fast-paced periods of AGN activity are triggered by mergers is plausible, but not necessary.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave cosmology in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) gravity, we systematically study gravitational waves (GWs), first produced by remote compact astrophysical sources and then propagating through the flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe at cosmic distances before arriving at detectors. Assuming that the speed $c_T$ of the spin-2 graviton is the same as that of photons, we find explicitly the stability conditions of the theory and then obtain the severest observational constraint found so far. In particular, all these conditions and constraints are satisfied, provided that $0 \leq \alpha\dot{f}(\phi_0) \lesssim 8.97 \times 10^{-24}$ (km), where $\alpha{f}(\phi)$ denotes the coupling strength between the scalar field $\phi$ and the Gauss-Bonnet term, an over-dot represents the derivative with respect to the cosmic time, and $\phi_0$ is the present value of $\phi$. The trajectories for both spin-2 and spin-0 gravitons and the amplitudes of GWs along the trajectories are explicitly obtained. The amplitude of a spin-2 GW is practically indistinguishable from that of GR, while the spin-0 GWs remain almost constant during radiation- and matter-dominated epochs, and in the dark energy-dominated epoch it is proportional to the physical distance between the source and the observer. A careful analysis shows that the latter is due to the assumption $c_T = 1$. When $c_T \not= 1$ to the extent that is consistent with the stability conditions and observational constraints, the above behavior disappears.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Current in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical background electric fields and the Schwinger effect in de Sitter space. We show that having a constant electric field in de Sitter requires the photon to have a tachyonic mass proportional to the Hubble scale. This has physical implications for the induced Schwinger current which affect its IR behaviour. To study this we recompute the Schwinger current in de Sitter space for charged fermions and minimally coupled scalars imposing a physically consistent renormalization condition. We find a finite and positive Schwinger current even in the massless limit. This is in contrast to previous calculations in the literature which found a negative IR divergence. We also obtain the first result of the Schwinger current for a non-minimally coupled scalar, including for a conformally coupled scalar which we find has very similar behaviour to the fermion current. Our results may have physical implications for both magnetogenesis and inflationary dark matter production.</description>

      <title>Gas outflows in two recently quenched galaxies at z = 4 and 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive ($M_\star\sim10^{10.2}M_\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\sim15\,M_\odot$/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $&lt;12\,M_\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\lesssim1$ and $\sim50$ for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the reason behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit $M_\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

      <title>Cuscuton Bounce Beyond the Linear Regime: Bispectrum and Strong Coupling Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cuscuton Gravity is characterized as a scalar field that can be added to general relativity without introducing any new dynamical degrees of freedom on a cosmological background. Yet, it modifies gravity such that spacetime singularities can be avoided. This has led to the Cuscuton bounce, a nonsingular cosmology that has been shown to be linearly stable, which is a rare feat. Upon introducing mechanisms known to generate a near-scale-invariant power spectrum of isocurvature perturbations in the prebounce contracting phase, we perform an extensive linear analysis of all scalar perturbations as they evolve through the Cuscuton bounce, both analytically and numerically. Then, after deriving the third-order perturbed action for our theory, we compare the magnitude of its terms (on shell) to those in the second-order action. We show that perturbativity is maintained in the infrared throughout the evolution, including through the bounce. In the ultraviolet, we show that a hierarchy of scales is maintained, with the strong coupling scale well above the relevant background energy scale at all times. We reconfirm these results by computing the three-point functions in various limits and demonstrate that the models do not have any strong coupling problems and furthermore that there is negligible non-Gaussianities on observable scales. Consequently, the primary potential source of observable non-Gaussianities may only arise from the conversion of isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations. The whole scenario is thus a robust, stable, weakly coupled nonsingular cosmological model, consistent with observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that if the universe started as a vacuum fluctuation rather than from a singular Big Bang state, the universe must have a late-time cosmic acceleration. This is required by a ``cosmological sum rule'' derived using the Schwarzian form of the Friedmann equations. We discuss possible connections to conformal and M\"obius transformations, and also compute that the best fit present cosmic data is consistent with the necessary crossing of the Schwarzian through zero having occurred (while it would not yet have happened in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology).</description>

      <title>A common origin of two accelerating universes: inflation and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantum theory of inflaton and its decay product of various gauge boson pairs to investigate the preheating towards thermalized universe. The inflaton decay into gauge-boson pairs is shown to be inevitably accompanied by tachyon-mass-like correction to inflation potential that ultimately leads to an inflaton escape out of trapped local potential minimum towards the field infinity. This gives rise to a conversion mechanism of early inflationary acceleration to a quintessence dark energy acceleration at late stages of cosmic evolution. The success of the escape depends on how standard particles are incorporated into a scheme of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. New types of super-radiance mechanism that enhance the ending of preheating are identified and compared with the Dicke model.</description>

      <title>Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal setup within the framework of Horndeski gravity that can describe a nonpathological Genesis scenario. Our setup allows for a fully stable transition to the kination epoch, during which General Relativity (GR) is restored. This Genesis scenario circumvents the no-go theorem at the cost of encountering the risk of strong coupling in the past. Interestingly, our scenario admits two different regimes for the background solution for Hubble parameter at the Genesis stage: power-law behavior and manifestly non-power-law behavior. We explicitly show that, in both regimes, our model remains within unitarity bounds. In most cases, the tensor spectrum is blue-tilted. Then, we adopt a mechanism with a spectator field that allows for a red-tilted scalar power spectrum. We also suggest a deformation of the model that enables us to achieve sufficiently small values for the r ratio. Finally, we discuss the geodesic (in)completeness of the current model.</description>

      <title>A new diagnostic for the null test of dynamical dark energy in light of DESI 2024 and other BAO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new diagnostic for the null tests of dynamical dark energy alongside two other combined equivalent diagnostics. These diagnostics are useful, especially when we include anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data in an analysis, to quantify the deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We also consider another diagnostic for isotropic BAO observations. These null tests are independent of any late-time dark energy model or parametrization. With these diagnostics, we study the evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 data combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations of the Planck 2018 mission and local $H_0$ measurements. We find no strong evidence for dynamical dark energy. The exclusion of the individual deviations at the effective redshift 0.51 of the DESI 2024 data makes the evidence even weaker. We get nearly similar results for other non-DESI BAO data. Both for DESI 2024 and other non-DESI BAO data, the evidence is almost independent of early-time physics. The evidence corresponding to the SHOES value of $H_0$ is higher than the corresponding tRGB value of $H_0$ for all combinations of data, but still not strong enough to reject the flat $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely established that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <title>Vector Dark Matter Halo: From Polarization Dynamics to Direct Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17315v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the characteristic polarization formation and evolution of vector dark matter (VDM) in the outer halo of galaxies. By employing numerical simulations, we analyze the behavior of VDM under different initial conditions -- homogeneous, isotropic, and partially polarized. The simulations solve the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, examining the spin density distribution and its evolution during gravitational collapse and halo formation. Our results reveal that VDM forms halos and central Proca stars from homogeneous and isotropic conditions, with the polarization density fluctuation amplitude mirroring VDM matter density. In scenarios with no initial polarization, spin density remains stable in the halo core but fluctuates in outer regions. Partially polarized initial conditions lead to a conservation of total polarization, with increased core polarization resulting in opposite polarization in the periphery. We examine the novel consequences of the partially polarized state for direct detection of dark photons, i.e., VDM kinetically mixed with ordinary photons.</description>

      <title>Expanding covariant cosmography of the local Universe: incorporating the snap and axial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies show that the model-independent, fully non-perturbative covariant cosmographic approach is suitable for analyzing the local Universe $(z\lesssim 0.1)$. However, accurately characterizing large and inhomogeneous mass distributions requires the fourth-order term in the redshift expansion of the covariant luminosity distance $d_L(z,\boldsymbol{n})$. We calculate the covariant snap parameter $\mathbb{S}$ and its spherical harmonic multipole moments using the matter expansion tensor and the evolution equations for lightray bundles. The fourth-order term adds 36 degrees of freedom, since the highest independent multipole of the snap is the 32-pole (dotriacontapole) $(\ell=5)$. Including this term helps to de-bias estimations of the covariant deceleration parameter. Given that observations suggest axially symmetric anisotropies in the Hubble diagram for $z \lesssim 0.1$ and theory shows that only a subset of multipoles contributes to the signal, we demonstrate that only 12 degrees of freedom are needed for a model-independent description of the local universe. We use an analytical axisymmetric model of the local Universe, with data that matches the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, in order to provide a numerical example of the amplitude of the snap multipoles and to forecast precision.</description>

Abstract: Stacking the public Planck CMB temperature maps (NILC, SMICA, SEVEM, Commander) on galaxy clusters from Planck catalogues reveals substantial residual contamination from thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) emission. Unexpectedly, stacking "tSZ-free" CMB maps, like the Planck SMICA-noSZ or Constrained ILC (CILC) maps, still shows noticeable residual contamination from galaxy clusters. We demonstrate that this persisting residual stems from neglected relativistic SZ (rSZ) corrections in the CMB map estimation. Employing a component-separation method specifically designed for the rSZ effect on Planck data, we map the rSZ first-order moment field $y(T_{\rm e}-\bar{T}_{\rm e})$ over the sky for different pivot temperatures $\bar{T}_{\rm e}$ ranging from $2$ to $10$ keV. Stacking these $y(T_{\rm e}-\bar{T}_{\rm e})$-maps on Planck clusters exhibits either an intensity decrement or increment at the centre, contingent upon whether $\bar{T}_{\rm e}$ is above or below the ensemble-averaged cluster temperature $T_{\rm e}$. For the pivot value $\bar{T}_{\rm e}=5$ keV, a vanishing intensity is observed in the stacked Planck $y(T_{\rm e}-\bar{T}_{\rm e})$-map, enabling us to infer the average gas temperature of $T_{\rm e}\simeq 5$ keV for Planck clusters. Building upon this finding, we revisit the Planck tSZ-free CMB map by deprojecting the complete rSZ emission using CILC, assuming an rSZ spectrum with $T_{\rm e} = 5$ keV. Our new, rSZ-free Planck CMB map, when stacked on clusters, shows a clear cancellation of residual SZ contamination in contrast to prior (non-relativistic) tSZ-free Planck CMB maps. Our map-based approach provides compelling evidence for an average temperature of the Planck galaxy clusters of $T_{\rm e} = 4.9 \pm 2.6$ keV using the rSZ effect.</description>

      <title>Super sample covariance and the volume scaling of galaxy survey covariance matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super sample covariance (SSC) is important when estimating covariance matrices using a set of mock catalogues for galaxy surveys. If the underlying cosmological simulations do not include the variation in background parameters appropriate for the simulation sizes, then the scatter between mocks will be missing the SSC component. The coupling between large and small modes due to non-linear structure growth makes this pernicious on small scales. We compare different methods for generating ensembles of mocks with SSC built in to the covariance, and contrast against methods where the SSC component is computed and added to the covariance separately. We find that several perturbative expansions, developed to derive background fluctuations, give similar results. We then consider scaling covariance matrices calculated for simulations of different volumes to improve the accuracy of the covariance matrix for a given computational time. On large scales, we find that the primary limitation is from the discrete number of modes contributing to the measured power spectrum, and we propose a new method for correcting this effect. Correct implementation of SSC and the effect of discrete mode numbers allows covariance matrices created from mocks to be scaled between volumes, potentially leading to a significant saving on computational resources when producing covariance matrices. We argue that a sub-percent match is difficult to achieve because of the effects of modes on scales between the box sizes, which cannot be easily included. Even so, when working in real space and cubic boxes, we show that a 3% match in the dark matter power spectrum covariance is achievable on scales of interest for current surveys scaling the simulation volume by 512x, costing a small fraction of the computational time of running full-sized simulations.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 III: weak-lensing analysis and merging scenario reconstruction of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 ($z=0.234$) is a post-merging system that exhibits symmetric double radio relics separated by ~2.7 Mpc. We present the first weak-lensing analysis of PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 and propose possible merging scenarios using numerical simulations. Our analysis with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging identifies a binary dark matter structure consisting of northern and southern components, separated by ~500 kpc. Assuming Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos, the masses for the northern and southern subclusters are $M_{200c}^{N} = 0.88_{-0.30}^{+0.35} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ and $M_{200c}^{S} = 2.71_{-0.48}^{+0.51} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, respectively. By superposing the two NFW halos, we determine the total mass of the cluster to be $M_{200c} = 4.22_{-1.00}^{+1.10} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ ($M_{500c} = 2.90_{-0.69}^{+0.75} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$). Our mass estimate suggests that the two relics are located around the cluster $R_{200c}$, where the density of the intracluster medium is very low. Our idealized simulations find that an off-axis collision of a 3:1 major merger can simultaneously reproduce the observed relic and dark matter halo separations. From these findings, we suggest that the system is observed ~0.9 Gyr after the first pericenter passage and is returning from the first apocenter.</description>

Abstract: In tomographic cosmic-shear observations, the BNT (Bernardeau, Nishimichi, Taruya) transform, Bernardeau et al. (2014), allows to build weak lensing transformed maps for which the contribution from low redshift lenses is nulled. As this transformation depends specifically on the expansion rate of the Universe but is independent of the matter distribution properties, it can be leveraged to extract information from large-scale structure probes at arbitrary non-linear scales, providing constraints on cosmological background evolution. We demonstrate this by proposing a specific null test for stage IV weak lensing projects. Using a Fisher matrix analysis and parameter sampling, we show that this approach can substantially enhance constraints on the dark energy equation of state. Notably, we find that shape noise currently limits this method's effectiveness making significant improvement possible in future designs. A detailed analysis of our null test in the context of the Euclid mission is presented in a companion paper Touzeau et al. (2025).</description>

      <title>Cosmic Shear Nulling as a geometrical cosmological probe: methodology and sensitivity to cosmological parameters and systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In tomographic weak lensing surveys, the presence of nulling properties reveals symmetries inherent in the data, which rely solely on the geometrical properties of the Universe. Ensuring its validity thus provides us with constraints on the cosmological parameters that describe the background evolution, particularly the redshift dependence of the cosmological angular distance. This forms the basis of the tomographic cosmic shear nulling test that we introduce here. We outline how such a test can be executed, what it can constrain, and its specific efficiency in constraining cosmological parameters. Additionally, we explore its sensitivity to astrophysical effects such as magnification bias and reduced shear corrections, as well as observational systematics like errors in the mean redshift of the source bins. Our findings indicate that in a scenario akin to that of Euclid, this nulling test can bring significant and complementary constraints on basic cosmological parameters such as $\{\Omega_m,{\rm w}_0\}$, provided that the mean redshift of the bins are known at a level of $10^{-3}$. We conclude that the combination of nulling as a cosmological probe or a consistence test with usual weak lensing and galaxy clustering probes could allow to better keep systematics under control and bring more precise results in the future.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Supercooled Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transitions (1stOPTs) are said to be strongly supercooled when the nucleation temperature is much smaller than the critical temperature. These are often encountered in theories that admit a nearly scale-invariant potential, for which the bounce action decreases only logarithmically with temperature. During supercooled 1stOPTs the equation of state of the universe undergoes a rapid and drastic change, transitioning from vacuum-domination to radiation-domination. The statistical variations in bubble nucleation histories imply that distinct causal patches percolate at slightly different times. Patches which percolate the latest undergo the longest vacuum-domination stage and as a consequence develop large over-densities triggering their collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs). We derive an analytical approximation for the probability of a patch to collapse into a PBH as a function of the 1stOPT duration, $\beta^{-1}$, and deduce the expected PBH abundance. We find that 1stOPTs which take more than $15\%$ of a Hubble time to complete ($\beta/H \lesssim 7$) produce observable PBHs. Their abundance is independent of the duration of the supercooling phase, in agreement with the de Sitter no hair conjecture.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the effect of the population model uncertainty on the strong lensing Bayes factor using nonparametric methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong lensing of gravitational waves can produce several detectable images as repeated events in the upcoming observing runs, which can be detected with the posterior overlap analysis (Bayes factor). The choice of the binary black hole population plays an important role in the analysis as two gravitational-wave events could be similar either because of lensing or astrophysical coincidence. In this study, we investigate the biases induced by different population models on the Bayes factor. We build up a mock catalog of gravitational-wave events following a benchmark population and reconstruct it using both nonparametric and parametric methods. Using these reconstructions, we compute the Bayes factor for lensed pair events by utilizing both models and compare the results with a benchmark model. We show that the use of a nonparametric population model gives a smaller bias than parametric population models. Therefore, our study demonstrates the importance of choosing a sufficiently agnostic population model for strong lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Conformal Higgs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale-invariant extensions of the electroweak theory are not only attractive because they can dynamically generate the weak scale, but also due to their role in facilitating supercooled first-order phase transitions. We study the minimal scale-invariant $U(1)_{\rm D}$ extension of the standard model and show that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) can be abundantly produced. The mass of these PBHs is bounded from above by that of the moon due to QCD catalysis limiting the amount of supercooling. Lunar-mass PBHs, which are produced for dark Higgs vev $v_\phi\simeq 20~\rm TeV$, correspond to the best likelihood to explain the HSC lensing anomaly. For $v_\phi\gtrsim 400~\rm TeV$, the model can explain hundred per cent of dark matter. At even larger hierarchy of scales, it can contribute to the $511~\rm keV$ line. While the gravitational wave (GW) signal produced by the HSC anomaly interpretation is large and detectable by LISA above astrophysical foreground, the dark matter interpretation in terms of PBHs can not be entirely probed by future GW detection. This is due to the dilution of the signal by the entropy injected during the decay of the long-lived $U(1)_{\rm D}$ scalar. This extended lifetime is a natural consequence of the large hierarchy of scales.</description>

      <title>More is Different: Multi-Axion Dynamics Changes Topological Defect Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topological defects in multi-axion models arising from multiple Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalars. Using a simplified two-axion system, we reveal fundamental differences in the evolution of these defects compared to single-axion scenarios. This finding is particularly significant because, despite the fact that integrating out heavier axions reduces these models to an effective single PQ scalar theory at low energies, the actual physical behavior of topological defects differs markedly from single-axion predictions. Unlike single-axion models where conventional cosmic strings form, multi-axion scenarios with post-inflationary or mixed initial conditions generically produce networks of strings interconnected by high-tension domain walls. This results in a severe cosmological domain wall problem. We determine string-wall network instability conditions and discuss cosmological implications including the application to the QCD axion and gravitational wave generation. Our findings highlight that multi-axion dynamics can lead to qualitatively different outcomes for topological defects, challenging the conventional picture of cosmic evolution of topological defects based on single-axion models.</description>

      <title>Partition function approach to non-Gaussian likelihoods: information theory and state variables for Bayesian inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of statistical physics concepts such as entropy extends far beyond classical thermodynamics. We interpret the similarity between partitions in statistical mechanics and partitions in Bayesian inference as an articulation of a result by Jaynes (1957), who clarified that thermodynamics is in essence a theory of information. In this, every sampling process has a mechanical analogue. Consequently, the divide between ensembles of samplers in parameter space and sampling from a mechanical system in thermodynamic equilibrium would be artificial. Based on this realisation, we construct a continuous modelling of a Bayes update akin to a transition between thermodynamic ensembles. This leads to an information theoretic interpretation of Jazinsky's equality, relating the expenditure of work to the influence of data via the likelihood. We propose one way to transfer the vocabulary and the formalism of thermodynamics (energy, work, heat) and statistical mechanics (partition functions) to statistical inference, starting from Bayes' law. Different kinds of inference processes are discussed and relative entropies are shown to follow from suitably constructed partitions as an analytical formulation of sampling processes. Lastly, we propose an effective dimension as a measure of system complexity. A numerical example from cosmology is put forward to illustrate these results.</description>

Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV, making the test of neutrino seesaw a great challenge. A striking fact is that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. Through the neutrino seesaw mechanism, fluctuations of the Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays, contributing to the curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to probe the high-scale neutrino seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by the seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In this work, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos. After inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field which act as the source of curvature perturbations. We demonstrate that this modulation produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures, which can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>$f(R)$ Gravity: Gravitational Waves Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review explores modified theories of gravity, particularly $f(R)$ gravity, as extensions to General Relativity (GR) that offer alternatives to dark energy for explaining cosmic acceleration. These models generalize the Einstein-Hilbert action to include functions of the Ricci scalar, providing new insights into cosmology and astrophysics. The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has enabled rigorous tests of $f(R)$ gravity, as deviations in GW propagation, speed, and polarization can signal modifications to GR. Constraints on $f(R)$ models arise from LIGO-Virgo observations of binary mergers, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), and complementary tests in cosmology and weak-field regimes. Future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope, will enhance sensitivity to smaller deviations from GR, necessitating advancements in theoretical modeling. Among competing theories -- including scalar-tensor, massive gravity, and Horndeski models -- $f(R)$ gravity remains a pivotal framework for understanding fundamental gravitational physics and cosmology. This review highlights key developments, challenges, and future directions in the field.</description>
