      <title>Accelerated creation of NOON states with ultracold atoms via counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17545v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum control protocol is proposed for the creation of NOON states with N ultracold bosonic atoms on two modes, corresponding to the coherent superposition $\vert N,0\rangle + \vert 0,N\rangle$. This state can be prepared by using a third mode where all bosons are initially placed and which is symmetrically coupled to the two other modes. Tuning the energy of this third mode across the energy level of the other modes allows the adiabatic creation of the NOON state. While this process normally takes too much time to be of practical usefulness, due to the smallness of the involved spectral gap, it can be drastically boosted through counterdiabatic driving which allows for efficient gap engineering. We demonstrate that this process can be implemented in terms of static parameter adaptations that are experimentally feasible with ultracold quantum gases. Gain factors in the required protocol speed are obtained that increase exponentially with the number of involved atoms and thus counterbalance the exponentially slow collective tunneling process underlying this adiabatic transition.</description>

      <title>Characterising transport in a quantum gas by measuring Drude weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport properties play a crucial role in defining materials as insulators, metals, or superconductors. A fundamental parameter in this regard is the Drude weight, which quantify the ballistic transport of charge carriers. In this work, we measure the Drude weights of an ultracold gas of interacting bosonic atoms confined to one dimension, characterising the induced atomic and energy currents in response to perturbations with an external potential. We induce currents through two distinct experimental protocols; by applying a constant force to the gas, and by joining two subsystems prepared in different equilibrium states. By virtue of integrability, dynamics of the system is governed by ballistically propagating, long-lived quasi-particle excitations, whereby Drude weights almost fully characterise large-scale transport. Indeed, our results align with predictions from a recently developed hydrodynamic theory, demonstrating almost fully dissipationless transport, even at finite temperatures and interactions. These findings not only provide experimental validation of the hydrodynamic predictions but also offer methodologies applicable to various condensed matter systems, facilitating further studies on the transport properties of strongly correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators: A View from the Corner Charge Fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, within a finite region is a powerful approach to characterizing quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that the corner charge fluctuation reveals universal information even for generic $\textit{lattice}$ systems of non-interacting electrons. We first prove that universal angle-dependence can be recovered in the $\textit{small-angle}$ limit for proper partitions of the lattice, from which the integrated Fubini-Study quantum metric can be extracted. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically. Numerical verification is presented for various Chern insulator models, demonstrating the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, we highlight a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity induced by strong electron-exciton coupling in doped atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mechanism to induce superconductivity in atomically thin semiconductors where excitons mediate an effective attraction between electrons. Our model includes interaction effects beyond the paradigm of phonon-mediated superconductivity and connects to the well-established limits of Bose and Fermi polarons. By accounting for the strong-coupling physics of trions, we find that the effective electron-exciton interaction develops a strong frequency and momentum dependence accompanied by the system undergoing an emerging BCS-BEC crossover from weakly bound $s$-wave Cooper pairs to a superfluid of bipolarons. Even at strong-coupling the bipolarons remain relatively light, resulting in critical temperatures of up to 10\% of the Fermi temperature. This renders heterostructures of two-dimensional materials a promising candidate to realize superconductivity at high critical temperatures set by electron doping and trion binding energies.</description>
