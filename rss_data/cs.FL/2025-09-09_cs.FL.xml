      <title>Scalable Learning of One-Counter Automata via State-Merging Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose One-counter Positive Negative Inference (OPNI), a passive learning algorithm for deterministic real-time one-counter automata (DROCA). Inspired by the RPNI algorithm for regular languages, OPNI constructs a DROCA consistent with any given valid sample set.
  We further present a method for combining OPNI with active learning of DROCA, and provide an implementation of the approach. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach scales more effectively than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed approach for learning visibly one-counter automata.</description>

      <title>On Synthesis of Timed Regular Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timed regular expressions serve as a formalism for specifying real-time behaviors of Cyber-Physical Systems. In this paper, we consider the synthesis of timed regular expressions, focusing on generating a timed regular expression consistent with a given set of system behaviors including positive and negative examples, i.e., accepting all positive examples and rejecting all negative examples. We first prove the decidability of the synthesis problem through an exploration of simple timed regular expressions. Subsequently, we propose our method of generating a consistent timed regular expression with minimal length, which unfolds in two steps. The first step is to enumerate and prune candidate parametric timed regular expressions. In the second step, we encode the requirement that a candidate generated by the first step is consistent with the given set into a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formula, which is consequently solved to determine a solution to parametric time constraints. Finally, we evaluate our approach on benchmarks, including randomly generated behaviors from target timed models and a case study.</description>

      <title>Decision Procedure for A Theory of String Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of sequences, supported by many SMT solvers, can model program data types including bounded arrays and lists. Sequences are parameterized by the element data type and provide operations such as accessing elements, concatenation, forming sub-sequences and updating elements. Strings and sequences are intimately related; many operations, e.g., matching a string according to a regular expression, splitting strings, or joining strings in a sequence, are frequently used in string-manipulating programs. Nevertheless, these operations are typically not directly supported by existing SMT solvers, which instead only consider the generic theory of sequences. In this paper, we propose a theory of string sequences and study its satisfiability. We show that, while it is undecidable in general, the decidability can be recovered by restricting to the straight-line fragment. This is shown by encoding each string sequence as a string, and each string sequence operation as a corresponding string operation. We provide pre-image computation for the resulting string operations with respect to automata, effectively casting it into the generic OSTRICH string constraint solving framework. We implement the new decision procedure as a tool $\ostrichseq$, and carry out experiments on benchmark constraints generated from real-world JavaScript programs, hand-crafted templates and unit tests. The experiments confirm the efficacy of our approach.</description>
