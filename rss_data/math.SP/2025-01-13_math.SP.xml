      <title>Analytic microlocal Bohr-Sommerfeld expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to Gevrey-analytic estimates in $\hbar$, of the Bohr-Sommerfeld expansion of the eigenvalues of self-adjoint pseudo-differential operators acting on $L^2(R)$ in the regular case. We consider an interval of energies in which the spectrum of $P$ is discrete and such that the energy sets are regular connected curves. Under some assumptions on the holomorphy of the symbol p, we will use the isometry between $L^2(R)$ and the Bargmann space to obtain an exponentially sharp description of the spectrum in the energy window . More precisely it is possible to build exponentially sharp WKB quasimodes in the Bargmann space. A precise examination of the principal symbols will provide an interpretation to the Maslov correction $\pi\hbar$ in the Bargmann space.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of walks in multidimensional orthants and reflection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider (random) walks in a multidimensional orthant. Using the idea of universality in probability theory, one can associate a unique polyhedral domain to any given walk model. We use this connection to prove two sets of new results. First, we are interested in a group of transformations naturally associated with any small step model; as it turns out, this group is central to the classification of walk models. We show a strong connection between this group and the reflection group through the walls of the polyhedral domain. As a consequence, we can derive various conditions for the combinatorial group to be infinite. Secondly, we consider the asymptotics of the number of excursions, whose critical exponent is known to be computable in terms of the eigenvalue of the above polyhedral domain. We prove new results from spectral theory on the eigenvalues of polyhedral nodal domains. We believe that these results are interesting in their own right; they can also be used to find new exact asymptotic results for walk models corresponding to these nodal polyhedral domains.</description>

      <title>The Born approximation for the fixed energy Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Born approximation of a potential in the context of the Calder\'on inverse problem is an object that can be formally defined in terms of spectral data of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. In this article, we prove, in the case of radial potentials in the Euclidean ball and any fixed energy, that this Born approximation is well-defined as a compactly supported radial distribution, and that the Calder\'on problem can be reformulated as recovering a potential from its Born approximation. In addition, we show that the Born approximation depends locally on the potential and captures exactly its singularities, and that the functional that maps the Born approximation to the potential is H\"older continuous. We also prove that the Born approximation converges to the potential in the high-energy limit. Moreover, we give an explicit formula for the Fourier transform of the Born approximation at any fixed energy, and illustrate how it can be used as the basis of an accurate procedure to approximate a potential from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>
