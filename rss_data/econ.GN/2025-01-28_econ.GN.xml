      <title>Enhancing Green Economy with Artificial Intelligence: Role of Energy Use and FDI in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating challenge of climate change necessitates an urgent exploration of factors influencing carbon emissions. This study contributes to the discourse by examining the interplay of technological, economic, and demographic factors on environmental sustainability. This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), energy consumption, and urbanization on CO2 emissions in the United States from 1990 to 2022. Employing the ARDL framework integrated with the STIRPAT model, the findings reveal a dual narrative: while AI innovation mitigates environmental stress, economic growth, energy use, FDI, and urbanization exacerbate environmental degradation. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, and DF-GLS) confirm mixed integration levels among variables, and the ARDL bounds test establishes long-term co-integration. The analysis highlights that AI innovation positively correlates with CO2 reduction when environmental safeguards are in place, whereas GDP growth, energy consumption, FDI, and urbanization intensify CO2 emissions. Robustness checks using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR validate the ARDL findings. Additionally, Pairwise Granger causality tests reveal significant one-way causal links between CO2 emissions and economic growth, AI innovation, energy use, FDI, and urbanization. These relationships emphasize the critical role of AI-driven technological advancements, sustainable investments, and green energy in fostering ecological sustainability. The study suggests policy measures such as encouraging green FDI, advancing AI technologies, adopting sustainable energy practices, and implementing eco-friendly urban development to promote sustainable growth in the USA.</description>

      <title>Economic Implications of Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility: Evidence from Banks in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the challenges and implications of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the banking sector of Bangladesh, highlighting its regulatory framework, implementation gaps, and alignment with sustainable development goals. While the central bank mandates CSR, the profit-driven nature of banking institutions often shifts the focus of CSR initiatives toward competitive advantage and brand enhancement rather than addressing genuine social and environmental needs. Major investments are concentrated in the education and health sectors, with minimal attention to ecological sustainability and marginalized communities. Weak regulatory oversight, profit-oriented governance structures, and limited stakeholder participation hinder the effective implementation of CSR. The lack of diversity in board representation, particularly the exclusion of women and underrepresented groups, further limits CSR's participatory and inclusive nature. This study underscores the need for stronger policy interventions, enhanced monitoring mechanisms, and a shift in corporate governance to transform CSR into a tool for meaningful societal impact. The findings call for further research to explore strategies for aligning profit-driven motives with sustainable and equitable development objectives.</description>

      <title>Investigating Circularity in India's Textile Industry: Overcoming Challenges and Leveraging Digitization for Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India's growing population and economy have significantly increased the demand and consumption of natural resources. As a result, the potential benefits of transitioning to a circular economic model have been extensively discussed and debated among various Indian stakeholders, including policymakers, industry leaders, and environmental advocates. Despite the numerous initiatives, policies, and transnational strategic partnerships of the Indian government, most small and medium enterprises in India face significant challenges in implementing circular economy practices. This is due to the lack of a clear pathway to measure the current state of the circular economy in Indian industries and the absence of a framework to address these challenges. This paper examines the circularity of the 93-textile industry in India using the C-Readiness Tool. The analysis comprehensively identified 9 categories with 34 barriers to adopting circular economy principles in the textile sector through a narrative literature review. The identified barriers were further compared against the findings from a C-readiness tool assessment, which revealed prominent challenges related to supply chain coordination, consumer engagement, and regulatory compliance within the industry's circularity efforts. In response to these challenges, the article proposes a strategic roadmap that leverages digital technologies to drive the textile industry towards a more sustainable and resilient industrial model.</description>

      <title>Skill-Based Labor Market Polarization in the Age of AI: A Comparative Analysis of India and the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines labor market polarization through a comparative analysis of skill-based employment and wage distributions in India and the United States during 2018-2023, with particular attention to differential automation risks and AI preparedness. Using detailed occupation-level data, automation risk metrics, and a series of statistical tests including wage premium analysis, employment share tests, and wage-employment regressions, we document significant structural differences in labor markets between developing and developed economies. Our analysis yields four key findings. First, we find statistically significant differences in employment distribution patterns, with India showing disproportionate concentration in low-skill employment compared to the US, particularly in occupations with high automation risk. Second, regression analysis reveals that wage premiums differ systematically between the two countries, with significantly larger skill-based wage gaps in India. Third, we find robust evidence of a negative relationship between employment size and wages, suggesting stronger labor supply effects in developing economies. Fourth, analysis of occupation-specific automation risk reveals that developing economies face a "double vulnerability" - concentration of employment in both low-skill occupations and jobs with higher automation potential, complicated by lower AI preparedness scores. These findings provide novel empirical evidence on how development stages influence labor market polarization patterns and carry important implications for skill development and technology adoption policies in developing economies. Our results suggest that traditional approaches to labor market development may need significant modification to account for the differential impacts of AI across development stages.</description>

      <title>Microfoundations of IPR and standardization strategies of companies: Evidence from the evolving European Single Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intellectual property rights (IPR) and standards are important institutions that by shaping appropriability conditions of companies impact international trade flows and the rate and direction of technological progress and innovation activity. We shed light on microfoundations of IPR and standardization capabilities and explore how companies have developed their IPR and standardization strategies and adapted to related institutional changes in the European Single Market. The analysis of the IPR and standardization strategies of companies active in P\"aij\"at-H\"ame region of Finland, a northern part of the European Union, reveals that only a few companies have explicit IPR and standardization strategies, but several have systematic approaches to following the development of standards and IPR environments in their industries. Companies build dynamic IPR and standardization capabilities and adapt their IPR and standardization strategies to the changing institutional environment via experiential learning.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Volatility of Energy Transition Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to a cleaner energy mix, essential for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, will significantly increase demand for metals critical to renewable energy technologies. Energy Transition Metals (ETMs), including copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements, are indispensable for renewable energy generation and the electrification of global economies. However, their markets are characterized by high price volatility due to supply concentration, low substitutability, and limited price elasticity. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the price volatility of ETMs, a subset of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs). Using a combination of exploratory data analysis, data reduction, and visualization methods, we identify key features for accurate point and density forecasts. We evaluate various volatility models, including Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and Stochastic Volatility (SV) models, to determine their forecasting performance. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in ETM volatility patterns, which challenge standard groupings by data providers and geological classifications. The results contribute to the literature on CRM economics and commodity volatility, offering novel insights into the complex dynamics of ETM markets and the modeling of their returns and volatilities.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Optimization for Long-Term Contract vs. Spot Allocation Decisions: Application to Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are numerous industrial settings in which a decision maker must decide whether to enter into long-term contracts to guarantee price (and hence cash flow) stability or to participate in more volatile spot markets. In this paper, we investigate a data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach aimed at balancing this tradeoff. Unlike traditional risk-neutral stochastic optimization models that assume the underlying probability distribution generating the data is known, DRO models assume the distribution belongs to a family of possible distributions, thus providing a degree of immunization against unseen and potential worst-case outcomes. We compare and contrast the performance of a risk-neutral model, conditional value-at-risk formulation, and a Wasserstein distributionally robust model to demonstrate the potential benefits of a DRO approach for an ``elasticity-aware'' price-taking decision maker.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in debt recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Debt recycling is an aggressive equity extraction strategy that potentially permits faster repayment of a mortgage. While equity progressively builds up as the mortgage is repaid monthly, mortgage holders may obtain another loan they could use to invest on a risky asset. The wealth produced by a successful investment is then used to repay the mortgage faster. The strategy is riskier than a standard repayment plan since fluctuations in the house market and investment's volatility may also lead to a fast default, as both the mortgage and the liquidity loan are secured against the same good. The general conditions of the mortgage holder and the outside market under which debt recycling may be recommended or discouraged have not been fully investigated. In this paper, to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional monthly mortgage repayment versus debt recycling strategies, we build a dynamical model of debt recycling and study the time evolution of equity and mortgage balance as a function of loan-to-value ratio, house market performance, and return of the risky investment. We find that the model has a rich behavior as a function of its main parameters, showing strongly and weakly successful phases - where the mortgage is eventually repaid faster and slower than the standard monthly repayment strategy, respectively - a default phase where the equity locked in the house vanishes before the mortgage is repaid, signalling a failure of the debt recycling strategy, and a permanent re-mortgaging phase - where further investment funds from the lender are continuously secured, but the mortgage is never fully repaid. The strategy's effectiveness is found to be highly sensitive to the initial mortgage-to-equity ratio, the monthly amount of scheduled repayments, and the economic parameters at the outset. The analytical results are corroborated with numerical simulations with excellent agreement.</description>
