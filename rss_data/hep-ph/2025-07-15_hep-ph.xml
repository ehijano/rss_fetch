      <title>Asymgenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework based on the standard type-I seesaw model that relates the baryon asymmetry of the universe to the dark matter (DM) density. The framework, which we name "Asymgenesis", relies on the presence of primordial charge asymmetries seeded either in the dark sector or in the visible sector. A higher-dimensional portal operator reshuffles this initial asymmetry into both sectors, eventually resulting in a nonzero $B-L$ asymmetry and an asymmetric DM component. Compared to conventional asymmetric-dark-matter (ADM) schemes, our framework imposes far milder requirements on the portal interaction. In particular, the portal interaction need not violate $B-L$, and the temperature scales of efficient $B-L$ violation and efficient charge-transfer interaction mediated by the portal operator can be separated. We develop the formalism in detail and argue that the flexibility of our framework enlarges the model-building landscape for ADM.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Minimal Dark Sectors via the 21 cm Line at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of the hydrogen hyperfine transition through the 21 cm line near the end of the cosmic dark ages provide unique opportunities to probe new physics. In this work, we investigate the potential of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal to constrain metastable particles produced in the early universe that decay at later times, thereby modifying the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic medium. The study begins by extending previous analyses of decaying dark matter (DM), incorporating back-reaction effects and tightening photon decay constraints down to DM masses as low as 20.4 eV. The focus then shifts to non-minimal dark sectors with multiple interacting components. The analysis covers two key scenarios: a hybrid setup comprising a stable cold DM component alongside a metastable sub-component, and a two-component dark sector of nearly degenerate states with a metastable heavier partner. A general parameterization based on effective mass spectra and fractional densities allows for a model-independent study. The final part presents two explicit realizations: an axion-like particle coupled to photons, and pseudo-Dirac DM interacting via vector portals or electromagnetic dipoles. These scenarios illustrate how 21 cm cosmology can set leading bounds and probe otherwise inaccessible regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Exploring ultra-high energy neutrino experiments through the lens of the transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a first-principles formalism, based on the transport equation in the line-of-sight approximation, to link the expected number of muons at neutrino telescopes to the flux of neutrinos at the Earth surface. We compute the distribution of muons inside Earth, arising from the up-scattering of neutrinos close to the detector, as well as from the decay of taus produced farther away. This framework allows one to account for systematic uncertainties, as well as to clarify the assumptions behind definitions commonly used in literature, such as the effective area. We apply this formalism to analyze the high-energy muon event recorded by KM3NeT, with a reconstructed energy of $ 120^{+110}_{-60} \, \mathrm{PeV}$ and an elevation angle of $\left(0.54\pm 2.4\right)^\circ$, in comparison with the non-observation of similar events by IceCube. We find a $3.1\,\sigma$ tension between the two experiments, assuming a diffuse neutrino source with a power-law energy dependence. Combining both datasets leads to a preference for a very low number of expected events at KM3NeT, in stark contrast to the observed data. The tension increases both in the case of a diffuse source peaking at the KM3NeT energy and of a steady point source, whereas a transient source may reduce the tension down to $1.6\,\sigma$. The formalism allows to treat potential beyond-the-Standard-Model sources of muons, and we speculate on this possibility to explain the tension.</description>

      <title>When CP requires $\bar\theta=0$, not $\bar\theta=\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imposing CP or P forces the QCD topological angle to be either $\bar\theta=0$ or $\bar\theta=\pi$. However, only the former is phenomenologically viable. This implies that the assumption of CP or P alone cannot provide a framework for unambiguously solving the Strong CP problem. We show that $\bar\theta=0$ is naturally selected when the assumption of CP is combined with the hypothesis that the Standard Model is embedded in a suitable gauge group.</description>

      <title>Updated Bounds on the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model from LHC Dilepton Resonance Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Left-Right model is a popular extension of the Standard Model that features three new neutral gauge bosons, $W^{\pm}_R$ and $Z_R$. Collider searches for a Left-Right symmetry are often concentrated on the charged right-handed current, but in this work, we take advantage of the dilepton data at the LHC with center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and 139 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity to place lower mass bounds in the $Z_R$ mass based on the $p\,p \rightarrow Z_{R} \rightarrow \ell^{+} \, \ell^{-}$ process. We vary the $SU(2)_R$ gauge coupling from $g_{R}=0.4$ to $g_{R}=1.0$, and impose $M_{Z_R}&gt;4.9$ TeV and $M_{Z_{R}}&gt;6.1$ TeV, respectively. Lastly, we put our findings into perspective with $W_R$ searches at the LHC and show that our limits cover an unexplored region of parameter space, where the right-handed neutrino is heavier than the $W_R$ boson.</description>

      <title>Tracing Neutrino Non-Standard Interactions through Charged Lepton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) play a crucial role in neutrino oscillations and can provide valuable insights for constructing models of neutrino masses and mixing. While NSI have been widely explored through oscillation and scattering experiments, as well as in cosmological and astrophysical contexts, we focus on probing them at future lepton colliders like the ILC, CLIC, and FCC-$ee$. If NSI arise from heavy mediators above the electroweak scale, these colliders can offer superior sensitivity compared to neutrino experiments across a broad mass range. A notable outcome is that lepton collider data can help resolve parameter degeneracies seen in oscillation studies. We find that large NSI scenarios, proposed to address the tension between T2K and NO$\nu$A results, can be completely tested at such collider facilities. We also explore the potential of future colliders like the FCC to probe leptonic NSI using lepton PDFs in proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>Beyond standard model particles in the atmospheric flux: a long-lived stau example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss fluxes of long-lived supersymmetric (SUSY) particles produced in the atmosphere from ultra-high energy cosmic-ray interactions with air nuclei. We consider long-lived particle production which proceeds first via the on-shell formation of heavier particles in the SUSY spectrum and then their decays. Specifically, we focus on the production of stau pairs from the decays of squarks produced in the initial cosmic ray-air collision under the purview of gauge-mediated symmetry breaking models that have the stau as the next-to-lightest SUSY particle. The calculation of the resulting stau flux schematically mirrors that of prompt atmospheric neutrino production, however, with the energy scale of initial hadronic collision set to EeV energy scales of the incident cosmic rays rather than the PeV energies where the prompt atmospheric neutrino fluxes dominate over neutrino fluxes from pions and kaons, and with the appropriate stau production cross section. We show the effect of accounting for the energy distribution of the staus relative to the squark energy distributions. We discuss the potential for future ultra-high energy detectors similar in scope to IceCube-Gen2 to detect atmospheric staus via tracks going through the detector volume. Current collider constraints on stau pair production within the SUSY framework considered here are more constraining than those from a detector like IceCube-Gen2 over ten years.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopoles: Theoretical Insights into the Cosmic Ray Conundrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high energy (UHE) photons above 10^{18} eV serve as valuable probes of fundamental physics. While typically produced in interactions involving charged particles, they could also originate from exotic sources such as annihilations of magnetically charged monopole-antimonopole pairs or decays of highly accelerated monopoles (10^{21} eV). Detecting such photons would impose constraints on monopole properties. Despite strong theoretical motivations and extensive experimental searches, no monopoles have been observed to date. A possible explanation beyond high monopole masses arises from Staruszkiewicz's quantum theory of infrared electromagnetic fields. His argument, rooted in the positivity of the Hilbert space norm, suggests that isolated magnetic monopoles may not be physically realizable. If correct, this would imply that while monopoles remain mathematically well-defined within field theories, only magnetically neutral configurations could exist in nature.</description>

      <title>Generation of a scalar vortex in a rotational frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider generation from the vacuum of a scalar charged field in a rigidly rotating frame. Adding an external magnetic field opens the way to Bose condensation of the field. This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</description>

      <title>Probing vector- vs scalar-mediator dark-matter scenarios in $B\to (K,K^*) M_X$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the hypothesis of the dark-matter origin of the excess in $B\to K M_X$ decays over the standard-model expectation, observed by Belle-II, we show that: (i) Scalar- and vector-medator scenarios may be unambiguously discriminated by measuring the differential distributions in $B\to K M_X$ and $B\to K^* M_X$ decays. (ii) Combining the available data on $\Gamma(B\to K M_X)$ and the upper limit on $\Gamma(B\to K^* M_X)$ provides a tight constraint on the vector mediator mass $M_V\lesssim 3$ GeV. At the same time, no constraints on the scalar-mediator mass are imposed by these data. (iii) Both scalar- and vector-mediator scenarios allow a good description of the differential distributions in $B\to K M_X$ measured by Belle-II and an extraction of dark-model parameters within both scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Neutrino Background through Parametric Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that relic neutrinos from the Big Bang may induce the parametric fluorescence in molecular systems, which offers a novel way to discover cosmic neutrino background. By coherently scattering with molecular energy levels, a massive neutrino can spontaneously ``decay" into a lighter neutrino and an infrared signal photon, i.e., $\nu^{}_{i} + M \to \nu^{}_{j} + \gamma^{}_{\rm S} + M$, where the molecular state $M$ remains unchanged after the scattering. Because the amplitudes of different radiants are matched in phase, the rate is coherently enhanced and proportional to the squared density of ambient dipoles. When the energy transfer from neutrinos coincides with the molecular energy-level difference, the fluorescence will be on resonance. We find that the event rate for $\nu^{}_{i} \to \nu^{}_{j} + \gamma^{}_{\rm S}$ at the resonance peak through the magnetic dipole transition can reach $R \sim 5~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ (or $10~{\rm yr}^{-1}$) for Dirac (or Majorana) neutrinos for a nominal target with a spatial dimension of $l=3~{\rm m}$. Parity mixing by the Stark effect may help to further magnify the signal rate.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Q-ball Interactions with Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-ball dark matter is one of candidates for the macroscopic dark matter: Q-ball is a non-topological solitonic configuration, whose stability can be ensured by global charge and energy conservation. One of the crucial factors for discovering signatures from the Q-ball dark matter, is the interactions of the Q-ball dark matter with ordinary matter. In particular, the scattering of ordinary matter off the Q-ball dark matter is important for the direct detection searches, such as paleo-detectors. It was conjectured that quarks incident on the Q-ball were reflected as anti-quarks with a probability of order unity, but it costs the energy of the squark in the Q-ball, which cannot be paid in the scattering of ordinary matter off the Q-ball dark matter. In addition, once a proton is reflected as an anti-proton, the Q-ball obtains the electromagnetic charge. In this study, we revisit the scattering process of quarks with the Q-ball with taking into account the energy cost of the scattering and the electromagnetic charge-up of the Q-ball.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of newly observed charm-strange meson states based on a relativistic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass spectra of charm-strange mesons including ground, radial and orbital excitations have been calculated within a relativistic Dirac framework. The predicted masses of the ground state $1S$ and the first orbital excited state $1P$ exhibits excellent agreement with values reported by the PDG. Utilizing these mass predictions and an effective Lagrangian approach based on heavy quark and chiral symmetries, we have computed the OZI allowed two body strong decay widths of higher excited state candidates of charm-strange sector. The resulting partial widths and branching ratios enable the assignment of spin-parity quantum numbers to several newly observed charm-strange states. In particular, we identify $D_{sJ}(2700)$ as the $2^3S_1$, $D_{s0}(2590)$ as the $2^1S_0$, $D_{sJ}(2860)$ as the $1^3D_3$, $D_{s1}(2860)$ as the $1^3D_1$, and $D_{sJ}(3040)$ as the $2^1P_1$ states. The effective coupling constants $g_T$, $g_X$, $g_Y$, $\tilde{g}_S$ and $\tilde{g}_H$ extracted from present analysis. Furthermore, the $D^*K$ decay channel emerges as the most promising mode for the experimental search of the missing $1^3D_2$ and $1^1D_2$ states, while the $2^3P_0$ state is more likely to be observed through the $DK$ channel.</description>

      <title>Two-particle cumulant distribution: a probe of "true" elliptic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have shown the two-particle correlations of charged hadrons in d-Au collisions at 200 GeV. These correlations were studied at different multiplicities and pseudorapidity intervals. The two-particle correlations arise due to Color Reconnections, resonance decays, jet correlations, and "jet-like" correlations of low-energy partons in softer interactions. These correlations are inversely proportional to multiplicity but remain unaffected (slowly increase) for larger pseudorapidity windows. We treated these correlations as distributions and calculated their skewness and kurtosis. The non-flow distributions deviate greatly from a Gaussian distribution and have high skewness and kurtosis. The "true" elliptic flow distributions resemble Gaussian distributions; they have significantly lower skewness and kurtosis. We suggest that if the two-particle cumulant flow is treated as a distribution, its skewness and kurtosis can be instrumental in distinguishing true flow and non-flow.</description>

Abstract: The Cutkosky cutting rules establish a direct connection between the imaginary parts of loop amplitudes and physical observables such as decay rates and cross sections, providing heuristic insights into the underlying processes. This work lays a robust theoretical foundation for the application of cutting rules in solid-state systems involving instantaneous dark matter (DM)-electron Yukawa interaction as well as the Coulomb potential. The cutting rules are formulated using the single-electron wavefunctions and corresponding energy eigenvalues obtained from the Kohn-Sham equations within density functional theory (DFT). This framework is not only of considerable theoretical interest but also holds significant practical relevance for studying DM phenomenology in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Can SMEFT discover New Physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel strategy to uncover indirect signs of new physics in collider data using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, offering notably improved sensitivity compared to traditional global analyses. Our approach leverages genetic algorithms to efficiently navigate the high-dimensional space of operator subsets, identifying deformations that improve agreement with data without relying on prior UV assumptions. This enables the systematic detection of SMEFT scenarios that outperform the Standard Model in explaining observed deviations. We validate the approach on current LHC and LEP measurements, perform closure tests with injected UV signals, and assess performance under high-luminosity projections. The algorithm successfully recovers relevant operator subsets and highlights directions in parameter space where deviations are most likely to emerge. Our results demonstrate the potential of SMEFT-based discovery searches driven by model selection, providing a scalable framework for future data analyses.</description>

      <title>Synchronization Induced by Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of ultralight bosonic dark matter (UlDM) to induce a synchronized behaviour on randomly evolving oscillators. We introduce a new interaction between UlDM and the oscillators and further demonstrate the occurence of the phase transition from disordered oscillators state into ordered state. For UlDM within the mass range of $10^{-14}\,\text{eV}/c^{2} \leq m_{\phi} \leq 1 \,\text{eV}/c^{2}$ as well as the white noise strength lower than 0.01 Hz, the synchronization of randomly distributed oscillators with the mean angular frequency $1$ Hz and the corresponding standard deviation 0.1 Hz occurs when the coupling strength between UlDM and oscillators lies within $10 \geq g_{\omega} \geq 10^{-13}$. This offers an alternative method to unveil the nature of UlDM with respect to the established experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Kinetic Mixing of Dark Photons from Dilepton Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons, the hypothetical gauge bosons associated with an additional $U(1)^{\prime}$ symmetry, can couple to Standard Model particles through a small kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ with the ordinary photon. This mechanism provides a portal between the dark sector and visible matter. In this study, we present a procedure to derive theoretical upper bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon^2(M_U)$ by analyzing dilepton spectra from heavy-ion collisions across a broad energy range, from SIS to LHC energies. Our analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions across the same energy range. Besides the dilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model particles (such as mesons and baryons), the PHSD has been extended to include the decay of hypothetical dark photons into dileptons, $U \to e^+ e^-$. The production of these dark photons occurs via Dalitz decays of $\pi^0$, $\eta$, $\omega$, $\eta^{\prime}$, and $\Delta$ resonances; direct decays of $\rho$, $\omega$, and $\phi$; the kaon mode $K^+ \to \pi^+ U$; and thermal $q\bar q$ annihilation in the quark-gluon plasma. Our results show that high-precision measurements of dilepton spectra in heavy-ion collisions provide a sensitive and competitive probe of dark photons in the MeV to multi-GeV mass range. Furthermore, we quantify the experimental accuracy required to constrain the remaining viable parameter space of kinetic mixing in dark photon scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neutrino physics, it is conventional to work with massive states corresponding to defined neutrino masses. However, in weak interaction processes, only flavor states participate, and the propagation can be described by an off-diagonal mass matrix. In this work, we operate directly with the non-diagonal mass matrix and employ a quantum field theory approach to describe neutrino oscillations within the plane-wave approximation, circumventing the use of wave packets. Within this framework, numerical estimates for the amplitude of a local process involving lepton interactions via virtual neutrino exchange yield values of order $10^{-53}$. For macroscopic processes with neutrino exchange, application of the matrix propagator reproduces the standard quantum mechanical neutrino oscillation probability formula while preserving relativistic invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent parameterizations of parton distribution functions (PDFs) have led to the determination of the gravitional form factors of the nucleon's dependence on generalized parton distributions of nucleons in the limit $\xi$$\to 0$. This paper aims to obtain the flavor division of nucleon electromagnetic and gravitional form factors using the VS24 Ansatz and two PDFs at $N^3L0$ approximation in GPDs. The PDFs and GPDs formalism enable the calculation of various form factors of nucleons in different approximations, as well as the calculation of the electric radius of nucleons. The study, despite its high approximation complexity, enhances the accuracy of calculations and brings them closer to the experimental values.</description>

      <title>GeV-scale thermal dark matter from dark photons: tightly constrained, yet allowed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GeV-scale thermal dark matter (DM) is highly constrained by the null results of both direct and indirect detection experiments, especially in the context of simplified models. In this work, we study the interplay of collider, direct and indirect detection constraints on an extension of the dark Abelian Higgs model that includes a Dirac fermionic DM candidate, $\chi$. We take into account in a consistent fashion the dilution of the indirect and direct detection signals when the relic abundance of $\chi$ is smaller than the total observed DM density (assuming that it is a subdominant component in those cases). As a consequence, we show that indirect detection constraints cannot probe regions with large kinetic mixing, and direct detection experiments provide the leading constraints in most of the parameter space. Collider searches for the (invisibly decaying) vector mediator provide complementary bounds in areas with large kinetic mixing. We find that the only way to avoid both indirect and direct detection limits is in narrow windows of parameter space close to $m_\chi\lesssim m_{Z_D}/2$, when $\chi$ is produced resonantly in the early universe, and it can constitute all of the DM. For this to happen, a small dark sector coupling is required: $\alpha_D~\lesssim10^{-3}$ for DM masses below $6$ GeV, or $\alpha_D~\lesssim10^{-5}$ for DM masses larger than $10$ GeV. The remaining areas of the parameter space can be probed in a complementary way by future direct detection experiments (which will narrow down the allowed area around the resonant region) and collider searches (which will set limits for smaller values of the kinetic mixing).</description>

      <title>Towards NNLO QCD predictions for off-shell top-quark pair production and decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider QCD radiative corrections to $W^+W^-b {\bar b}$ production with leptonic decays and massive bottom quarks at the LHC. We perform an exact next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation within the $q_T$-subtraction formalism and validate it against an independent computation in the dipole subtraction scheme. Non-resonant and off-shell effects related to the top quarks and the leptonic decays of the $W^\pm$ bosons are consistently included. We also consider the approximation in which the real-emission contribution is computed exactly while the virtual is evaluated in the double-pole approximation (DPA), which formally requires the inclusion of both factorisable and non-factorisable corrections. We evaluate such contributions and show that the DPA performs remarkably well at both the inclusive and differential levels. We then extend our calculation to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). All tree-level and one-loop amplitudes are evaluated exactly, while the missing two-loop virtual contribution is estimated using the DPA. The factorisable two-loop corrections are explicitly computed by relying on available results for the polarised two-loop on-shell top-quark pair production amplitudes and the corresponding top-quark decays. The non-factorisable contributions are inferred by exploiting the cancellation of logarithmic singularities in the $\Gamma_t\to 0$ limit through an on-shell matching procedure. The NNLO corrections for the inclusive cross section are found to increase the NLO prediction by approximately $11\%$, with a numerical uncertainty that is conservatively estimated to be below the $2\%$ level $\unicode{x2013}$ significantly smaller than the $5\%$ residual perturbative uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Nuclear modification factor within a dynamical approach to the complex entropic index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to the nuclear deformation factor $R_{AA}$, grounded in the dynamical effects of the Quark-Gluon Plasma on parton momentum. The approach uses the Blast-Wave method combined with Tsallis Statistics, within the Copper-Frye freeze-out framework and, by profiting from appropriate simplifications, it gives analytical expressions that describe the observed $R_{AA}$ for two sets of independent measurements at $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV. A nonlinear dynamical equation describes the dynamics and leads to log-periodic oscillations. With the analytical solutions for that equation, it is possible to link the dynamical approach with the complex-$q$ formalism, which was proposed to describe the log-oscillations observed in experimental data.</description>

This enables us to give a nonperturbative proof of factorization for the energy correlators, relate the energy correlator jet function to transverse-momentum-sensitive dihadron fragmentation functions, and provide a rigorous description of the confinement transition region.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many theories, matter-antimatter asymmetries originate from out-of-equilibrium decays and scatterings of heavy particles. While decays remain efficient, scattering rates typically drop below the Hubble rate as the universe expands. We point out the possibility of scatterings between non-relativistic particles and the relativistic bath whose cross-sections grow with decreasing temperature, leading to scattering rates that track or exceed the Hubble rate at late times. This results in soaring asymmetry generation, even at low scales and with small CP- or baryon/lepton-violating couplings.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of hypothetical strange stars as an efficient source ultra-high-energy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical behavior of strange quark matter (SQM) objects, such as stars and planets, when subjected to radial oscillations induced by tidal interactions in stellar systems. Our study demonstrates that SQM objects can efficiently convert mechanical energy into hadronic energy due to the critical mass density at their surfaces of 4.7*10^{14} g/cm^3, below which SQM becomes unstable and decays into photons, hadrons, and leptons. We show that even small-amplitude radial oscillations, with a radius change of as little as 0.1%, can result in significant excitation energies near the surface of SQM stars. This excitation energy is rapidly converted into electromagnetic energy over short timescales approximately 1 ms, potentially leading to observable astrophysical phenomena. Higher amplitude oscillations may cause fragmentation or dissolution of SQM stars, which has important implications for the evolution of binary systems containing SQM objects and the emission of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Positive Parity Dibaryons with Maximal Charm and Strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the ground-state energy spectra of dibaryons composed of single-flavor quarks, specifically systems with strangeness $\mathcal{S} = -6$ and charm $\mathcal{C} = 6$. Our lattice QCD study is based on $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC ensembles with highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea quarks, spanning four lattice spacings and two spatial volumes. We employ valence quark propagators realized using a relativistic overlap action, evaluate correlation matrices with carefully designed operator bases, and extract reliable ground-state energy estimates in the $S = 0$ and $S = 2$ spin channels. We explore their binding characteristics and interaction dynamics by examining the energy separation between the dibaryon states and the corresponding two-baryon thresholds. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of single-flavor dibaryon states as a function of the quark masses. In the $S=0$ channel, the $\Omega_{ccc}$-$\Omega_{ccc}$ system exhibits a clear signal of a bound state, while the $\Omega$-$\Omega$ system lies very close to the threshold, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. For $S=2$, both systems are found to be unbound.</description>

      <title>Ideal Boson Particle-Antiparticle System at Finite Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of an ideal bosonic system composed of particles and antiparticles at finite temperatures are examined within the framework of a scalar field model. It is assumed that particle-antiparticle pair creation occurs; however, the system is simultaneously subject to exact charge (isospin) conservation. To implement this constraint, we first consider the system within the Grand Canonical Ensemble and then transform to the Canonical Ensemble using a Legendre transformation. This procedure provides a formally consistent scheme for incorporating the chemical potential at the microscopic level into the Canonical Ensemble framework. To enforce exact conservation of charge (isospin, N_I), we further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system within the extended Canonical Ensemble, in which the chemical potential becomes a thermodynamic function of the temperature and conserved charge. It is shown that as the temperature decreases, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical temperature T_c, but only when the conserved charge is finite, N_I=const \ne 0. In a particle-antiparticle system, the condensate forms exclusively in the component with the dominant particle number density, which determines the excess charge. We demonstrate that the symmetry breaking of the ground state at T=0 results from a first-order phase transition associated with the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate. Although the transition involves symmetry breaking, it is not spontaneous in the strict field-theoretic sense, but is instead induced by the external injection of particles. Potential experimental signals of Bose-Einstein condensation of pions produced in high-energy nuclear collisions are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Feynman Integral Reduction using Syzygy-Constrained Symbolic Reduction Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals with high powers of numerators or propagators, a demanding computational step in evaluating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. The algorithm starts with solving syzygy equations in individual sectors to produce IBP operators that turn seed integrals into IBP equations without artificially raised propagator powers. The IBP operators are expressed in terms of index-shift operators and number operators. We perform row reduction to systematically reshuffle the IBP operators and expose reduction rules with symbolic dependence on the powers of propagators and numerators. When this is insufficient, we produce more symbolic reduction rules by directly solving the linear system of IBP equations in which some propagator/numerator powers are kept symbolic. This linear system is kept small, as the equations are generated from a small set of seed integrals in the neighborhood of the target integral. We stress-test our algorithm against two highly non-trivial examples, namely rank-20 integrals for the double box with an external mass and the massless pentabox. As an application, we revisit the IBP reduction in a calculation of scattering amplitudes for spinning black hole binary systems, which involves two-loop Feynman integrals with complexity greater than 20, and achieve much faster IBP reduction than that of the original calculation.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of exploiting Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations of extragalactic sources to infer constraints on the intensity of cosmological background radiations, as well as on deviations from the standard model of particles and physical interactions (like violations of Lorentz invariance and axion-like particles -- LIV and ALPs), we discuss here possible contaminant effects due to the presence of radiations fields from local sources. We specifically model and analyze the foreground radiations produced inside the host galaxy of the VHE source and the cosmic environment itself hosting the source, as well as radiations produced in the Milky Way, along the VHE source's observational line-of-sights. Our analysis shows that such contaminant foregrounds may indeed impact on observations of only the very local Active Galactic Nuclei (e.g. Centaurus A), but not significantly those in the Virgo cluster (M87) and beyond.</description>

      <title>Measured Lepton Magnetic Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron and muon magnetic moment have played, and continue to play, important roles in testing the fundamental mathematical description of physical reality called the Standard Model of particle physics (SM). The electron magnetic moment is the most precisely measured property of an elementary particle and the most precise SM prediction, setting up the most precise confrontation ever between experiment and theory. It enables the most precise test of quantum field theory, and of the fundamental CPT symmetry invariance of the SM with leptons. The stable electron is studied with quantum methods while the electron remains for months in its quantum ground and first excited states. The muon magnetic moment is one of the most precisely measured property of an unstable elementary particle. Although less precise measured than the electron, it provides greater sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model -- a powerful tool for testing the existence of new particles and forces. Because muons decay quickly, they must be studied as they orbit at nearly the speed of light in a large storage ring. The extremely high precision of the electron and muon magnetic moment measurements has driven major advances in theoretical physics, inspiring new techniques in quantum field theory, precision calculations, and lattice gauge theory. Only experimental limits currently exist on the size of the magnetic moments of the tau and neutrino leptons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the Bayesian model selection method (based on the Bayes factor) to optimize $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$-dependence in the phenomenological parameters of the (3+1)-dimensional hybrid framework for describing relativistic heavy-ion collisions within the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. The effects of various experimental measurements on the posterior distribution are investigated. We also make model predictions for longitudinal flow decorrelation, rapidity-dependent anisotropic flow and identified particle $v_0(p_\mathrm{T})$ in Au+Au collisions, as well as anisotropic flow coefficients in small systems. Systematic uncertainties in the model predictions are estimated using the variance of the simulation results with a few parameter sets sampled from the posterior distributions.</description>

      <title>UV completions of scalar-tensor EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study models that give rise to scalar-tensor effective field theories (EFTs) at low energies. Our framework involves massive particles of spin $S=0, 1/2, 1$ coupled to gravity and to a real massless scalar in the UV. Integrating out the massive states leads to a scalar-tensor EFT describing the massless graviton and scalar degrees of freedom. Using the on-shell amplitude methods and the spinor-helicity formalism, we match the two frameworks at one loop, so as to express the EFT Wilson coefficients in terms of the UV masses and coupling. We explore the space of the operators generated in the EFT, including the ones related to the scalar Gauss-Bonnet (SGB) and dynamical Chern-Simons (DCS) gravity theories. We demonstrate that, within our setup, the SGB interactions are always generated with shift-symmetry breaking operators. This is in contrast to the DCS case, where there is a unique choice that preserves the shift symmetry in the IR, corresponding to a theory of spin 1/2 fermions and a complex scalar with a Peccei-Quinn global symmetry.</description>

      <title>FlexCAST: Enabling Flexible Scientific Data Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of scientific data analyses is a resource-intensive process that often yields results with untapped potential for reuse and reinterpretation. In many cases, a developed analysis can be used to measure more than it was designed for, by changing its input data or parametrization. Existing reinterpretation frameworks, such as RECAST, enable analysis reinterpretation by preserving the analysis implementation to allow for changes of particular parts of the input data. We introduce FlexCAST, which generalizes this concept by preserving the analysis design itself, supporting changes to the entire input data and analysis parametrization. FlexCAST is based on three core principles: modularity, validity, and robustness. Modularity enables a change of the input data and parametrization, while validity ensures that the obtained results remain meaningful, and robustness ensures that as many configurations as possible yield meaningful results. While not being limited to data-driven machine learning techniques, FlexCAST is particularly valuable for the reinterpretation of analyses in this context, where changes in the input data can significantly impact the parametrization of the analysis. Using a state-of-the-art anomaly detection analysis on LHC-like data, we showcase FlexCAST's core principles and demonstrate how it can expand the reach of scientific data analysis through flexible reuse and reinterpretation.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillation measurements with KamLAND and JUNO in the presence of scalar NSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07343v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determination of neutrino mass ordering and precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters are the foremost goals of the JUNO experiment. Here, we explore the effects of scalar non-standard interactions (sNSI) on the electron anti-neutrino survival probability measured by JUNO. sNSI appear as corrections to the neutrino mass term in the Hamiltonian. We have considered the simplest scenario where there is only one NSI ($\eta_{ee}$) present in the theory. Our results show that sNSI can have a significant effect on neutrino oscillation probabilities at the medium- and long-baseline reactor experiments. We fit KamLAND data assuming non-zero sNSI in theory and find that {\it estimates of $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$ from KamLAND deviate significantly from their standard best-fit values} if one assumes sNSI in the theory. $\eta_{ee} \in [-1.0, 1.0]$ is allowed by KamLAND. JUNO cannot constrain sNSI but it can robustly measure $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$ even when they differ widely from their current best-fit values. {\it Our work highlights the necessity of global analysis of constraints on sNSI and standard two-flavour oscillation parameters before arduous three-flavour questions such as neutrino mass ordering or CP violation in their presence are attempted.</description>

      <title>Global coupled-channel analysis of $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ processes in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-precision $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ data from the BESIII and Belle are highly useful to understand vector charmonium ($\psi$) pole structures and puzzling lineshapes due to the exotic hadron candidates $Y$. We thus perform a global coupled-channel analysis of most of the available data (10 two-body, 9 three-body, and 1 four-body final states) in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV. Not only cross sections but also invariant-mass distributions of subsystems are fitted. The $e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-$ cross sections are also predicted. Our model includes dozens of (quasi) two-body states that nonperturbatively couple with each other through bare $\psi$ excitations, particle-exchange, and short-range mechanisms; approximate three-body unitarity is considered. The amplitudes obtained from the fit are analytically continued to $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles. We find $\psi$ states similar to those in the Particle Data Group listing and $Y(4320)$. Moreover, several $\psi$ states, including new ones, are found close to open charm thresholds. Trajectories and compositeness of the near-threshold poles suggest dominant hadron-molecule contents in their internal structures. Two $Z_c$ poles are found as virtual states $\sim$40 MeV below the $D^*\bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds, being consistent with lattice QCD results. This work presents the first global analysis to determine $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles, thereby paving the way to extracting detailed properties of the prominent exotic hadron candidates from data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal scenario for light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV to GeV range by incorporating a scalar singlet DM in a type-I seesaw scenario extended by an additional Higgs doublet $\phi_2$. The latter permits efficient annihilation of light scalar DM into leptonic final states including right-handed neutrinos (RHN). We keep the charged fermion as well as neutral fermion final states in forbidden regime to avoid bounds from indirect search as well as cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. After studying the purely forbidden DM scenario with neutral and charged fermion final states separately, we discuss the interplay of forbidden and non-forbidden channels in generating light thermal DM relic by considering neutral fermions in non-forbidden mode due to relatively weaker constraints. The model can also explain the anomalous magnetic moment of muon, W-mass anomaly and saturate experimental bounds on charged lepton flavour violation and DM direct detection while offering tantalising detection prospects of RHN, the mass of which is kept approximately in the same range as DM.</description>

      <title>Discovery potential of a long-lived partner of inelastic dark matter at MATHUSLA in $U(1)_{X_3}$ extension of the standard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential at the MATHUSLA experiment of a long-lived particle (LLP), which is the heavier state of inelastic scalar dark matter (DM) in third generation-philic $U(1)$ ($U(1)_{X_3}$) extension of the standard model. Since the heavier state and DM state form the complex scalar charged under the $U(1)_{X_3}$, it is natural that the heavier state $P$ is almost degenerate with the DM state and hence long-lived. We find that third generation-philic right-handed $U(1)$, $U(1)_{R_3}$, model is the most interesting, because third generation-philic models are less constrained by the current experimental results and right-handed $U(1)$ interactions leave visible final decay products without produing neutrinos. For a benchmark of the model parameters consistent with the current phenomenological constraints, we find that the travel distance of the LLP can be $\mathcal{O}(100)$ m and the LLP production cross section at the 14 TeV LHC can be $\mathcal{O}(10)$ fb. Thus, we conclude that the LLP can be discovered at the MATHUSLA with a sufficiently large number of LLP decay events inside the MATHUSLA detector.</description>

      <title>Universality of the baryon axial vector current operator in large-$N_c$ chiral perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryon axial vector current is computed in a combined formalism in $1/N_c$ and chiral corrections. Flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry breaking is accounted for in two ways: Implicitly through the integrals occurring in the one-loop graphs and explicitly through perturbative symmetry breaking. Loop integrals can be expanded in a power series in the ratio of the decuplet-octet baryon mass difference to the pseudoscalar meson mass and the first three terms in the series are retained and evaluated. The universal baryon axial vector current so constructed is neither diagonal nor off-diagonal in the sense that it can connect baryon states of either different or equal spins to obtain appropriate axial vector couplings. Processes of interest are found in octet-baryon and decuplet-baryon semileptonic decays and strong decays of decuplet baryons. A fit to the available experimental information is performed to determine the free parameters in the formalism, which allows one to estimate, for instance, the leading axial vector coupling in the semileptonic decay $\Omega^- \to{\Xi^*}^0\ell^-\overline{\nu}_\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a KSVZ-like extension of the Standard Model with a Dirac fermion and three right-handed neutrinos. PQ symmetry allows the Dirac mass for neutrinos and prevents the Majorana mass. A $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry guarantees the stability of Dirac fermion dark matter. The breakdown of PQ symmetry generates the QCD axion at a high scale. The fermion dark matter relic abundance arises from the UV-freeze-in mechanism through the axion portal. We determine the fermion DM relic by solving the coupled Boltzmann equations and finding the allowed parameter space using the relic density constraints. Having determined the allowed parameter space for fermion DM, we also look for non-thermal axion production schemes to seek the two DM possibility. We find that FIMP alone is a suitable dark matter that is not excluded while considering several current bounds and future sensitivities on axion and dark matter. Our study highlights the interlinking of dark matter, axion, and neutrinos while addressing the strong CP problem and small neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Widen the Resonance: Probing a New Regime of Neutrino Self-Interactions with Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions beyond the standard model have profound implications in astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we study an uncharted scenario in which one of the three neutrino species has a mass smaller than the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background. This results in a relativistic component that significantly broadens the absorption feature on the astrophysical neutrino spectra, in contrast to the sharply peaked absorption expected in the extensively studied scenarios assuming a fully nonrelativistic cosmic neutrino background. By solving the Boltzmann equations for neutrino absorption and regeneration, we demonstrate that this mechanism provides novel sensitivity to sub-keV mediator masses, well below the traditional $\sim 1$--100 MeV range. Future observations of the diffuse supernova neutrino background with Hyper-Kamiokande could probe coupling strengths down to $g \sim 10^{-8}$, surpassing existing constraints by orders of magnitude. These findings open new directions for discoveries and offer crucial insights into the interplay between neutrinos and the dark sector.</description>

Abstract: In the HEFT, we consider the Regge limit of the two-loop amplitudes for Higgs boson production in association with a jet, expanded to NNLL accuracy. We discuss the issue of the Regge cuts versus poles in this context, showing that the former cannot contribute through three loops, due to the simplicity of the colour structure of the amplitudes. Finally, we determine for the first time the Higgs impact factor at two-loop accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scale-dependent dipole-pion cross section is analyzed as a function of the dipole size $r$ and the impact parameter $b$. This analysis relies on the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equation in ${\mu}{\sim} 1/r +{\mu}_{0}$ at the next-to-leading order (NLO) approximation, with a specific initial condition at ${\mu}_{0}$. The dipole-pion cross section at small Bjorken variable $\beta$ is being considered over a wide range of transverse separations $r$. Using the Laplace transformation technique, we describe the determination of the dipole-pion cross section based on the gluon distribution at the initial scale ${\mu}_{0}$ within a kinematic region characterized by low values of the Bjorken variable $\beta$. We found that geometric scaling for the dipole-pion cross section holds approximately within a wide kinematic region of $rQ_{s}$. The cross section saturates at large dipole sizes.</description>

Abstract: We point out a novel mechanism to generate $\cos \phi$ two-particle azimuthal correlation (`directed flow') in unpolarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions in the forward rapidity region of the projectile proton. This is a direct consequence of the recently discovered strong spin-orbit coupling in gluons at small-$x$. The observable simultaneously serves as a unique probe into the double helicity parton distribution functions of the proton.</description>

      <title>Jet Substructure Probe on Scalar Leptoquark Models via Top Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of leptoquarks and their couplings to fermions with different chiralities provides a powerful tool for distinguishing among different leptoquark models. As a case study, we focus on two specific third-generation scalar leptoquark models, $S_3$ and $R_2$, which differ in their electroweak quantum numbers and chiral structures of couplings to the top quark, leading to distinct top-quark polarization states. To enhance the efficacy of the analysis, we employ jet substructure techniques like Soft Drop, $N$-subjettiness, and our custom $b$-tagging method, along with other event variables. The analysis has been performed using both fixed radius and dynamic radius jet clustering algorithms. A multivariate analysis using a boosted decision tree (BDT) is performed to isolate signal from the Standard Model background. For a leptoquark mass of 1250 GeV, the analysis achieves a signal significance of up to $5.3\,\sigma$ at the 14 TeV HL-LHC. Furthermore, a $CL_s$-based profile likelihood estimator is applied to polarization-sensitive variables to discriminate between the two models. To enhance separation between the two models, an additional BDT classifier score is obtained by training a BDT network to distinguish between the $S_3$ and $R_2$ models. In the chosen signal region, the BDT classifier score provides a separation score of up to $3.2\,\sigma$, outperforming traditional variables such as $E_b/E_t$ and $\cos\theta_b$.</description>

      <title>Heavy Mesons to Charmed Tetraquark Decays</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of $T^*_{cs0}(2870)^0$, $T^*_{c\bar s 0}(2900)^0$ and $T^*_{c\bar s 0}(2900)^{++}$ charmed tetraquark states by LHCb, we study the decays of heavy mesons to these charmed tetraquark states ($T$) using a topological amplitude approach. We first obtain the $T\to DP$ and $DS$ strong decay amplitudes by decomposing them into several topological amplitudes, where $P$ is a light pseudo-scalar particle and $S$ is a low-lying scalar particle. Later on, weak decay amplitudes of $\bar B\to D\bar T$, $\bar D T$ and $\bar B\to TP$, $TS$ decays are also decomposed topologically. In addition, $B^-_c\to T\bar T$ decays are also discussed. Using these results, modes with an unambiguous exotic interpretation in flavor are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Production mechanism of doubly charmed exotic mesons $T_{cc}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production mechanism for doubly charmed tetraquark mesons within a coupled-channel formalism. The two-body Feynman kernel amplitudes are constructed using effective Lagrangians that respect heavy quark symmetry, chiral symmetry, SU(3) flavor symmetry, and hidden local symmetry. The fully off-shell coupled scattering equations are solved within the Blankenbecler-Sugar (BbS) reduction scheme. We find three positive-parity and one negative-parity tetraquark states with total spin $J=1$. Among them, two positive-parity states appear as bound states in the isoscalar and isovector $DD^*$ channels, while another appears as a resonance in the $D^*D^*$ channel. A negative-parity resonance is also predicted in the isoscalar channel. We analyze the coupling strengths of these tetraquark states to various channels. The dependence of the results on the reduced cutoff mass $\Lambda_0$ is examined. The most significant tetraquark state remains stable within the range of $\Lambda_0=(600-700)$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Looking for Black Hole Morsels in Astrophysical Mergers via Hawking Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observation has provided numerous insights into the merger of astrophysical black holes. In contrast to other violent events (e.g. supernovae), they are, however, not expected to lead to significant emissions of photons and neutrinos. In this paper we discuss a scenario that would lead to characteristic observable gamma ray bursts, which would provide numerous hints to physics beyond General Relativity. Starting from the hypothesis that micro-black holes (called morsels) are formed during the merger process, we show that it is possible to observe their Hawking radiation, which takes the form of gamma ray bursts of a uniquely characteristic form: with energies in the TeV range, their temporal structure is unlike that stemming from any other astrophysical event. Notably, the time delay from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels, allowed by the unaccounted merger mass, leads to a Hawking radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC, and gamma ray space telescopes, such as Fermi-LAT. This renders the hypothesis of morsel creation experimentally testable, and we provide the first concrete bounds on the total mass of morsels formed in specific events.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Muons in Binary Neutron Star Mergers: First Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a set of binary neutron star (BNS) merger simulations including the net muon fraction as an additional degree-of-freedom in the equation of state (EoS) and hydrodynamics evolution using the numerical-relativity code BAM. Neutrino cooling is modeled via a neutrinos leakage scheme, including in-medium corrections to the opacities and emission rates of semi-leptonic charged-current reactions, although within the elastic approximation. We show that, for our particular choice of baseline baryonic EoS, the presence of muons delays the gravitational collapse of the remnant compared to the case where muons are neglected. Furthermore, when muons and muonic weak reactions are considered, no gravitational collapse occurs within our simulation time and muons are confined in the densest portions of the remnant, while the disk is effectively colder, less protonized and de-muonized. Accordingly, ejecta properties are affected, e.g., ejecta masses are systematically smaller for the muonic setups and exhibit a larger fraction of neutron-rich, small velocity material. Overall, our results suggest that the inclusion of muons and muon-flavored neutrino reactions in the context of BNS merger simulations should not be neglected, thus representing an important step towards more realistic modeling of such systems.</description>

Abstract: We study stimulated emission and absorption of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state immersed in a thermal radiation bath. Employing one-loop interaction-picture perturbation theory, we track the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in the squeezed vacuum, which characterizes the inflationary graviton state. In a Minkowski background with a thermal bath as a toy example, we demonstrate that the net graviton emission or absorption rate depends sensitively on the initial squeezing parameters. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors operating in radiation at temperatures of order 0.1 GeV and find that graviton occupation numbers at frequencies of order 100 Hz can be significantly enhanced, suggesting a novel mechanism for amplifying gravitational-wave signals. Although these conditions exceed current experimental capabilities, they point toward potential future advances in detection. Extending our analysis to an expanding, radiation-dominated universe, we show that subhorizon gravitons undergo stimulated absorption, while superhorizon modes exhibit secular logarithmic growth, indicating the breakdown of perturbative methods and motivating further investigation. These findings open a new direction for exploring graviton coherence effects in realistic cosmological and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>More varieties of 4-d gauge theories: product representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we used methods of arithmetic geometry to study the anomaly-free irreducible representations of an arbitrary gauge Lie algebra. Here we generalize to the case of products of irreducible representations, where it is again possible to give a complete description. A key result is that the projective variety corresponding to $m$-fold product representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}_n$ is a rational variety for every $m$ and $n$. We study the simplest case of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ (corresponding to the strong interaction) in detail. We also describe the implications of a number-theoretic conjecture of Manin (and related theorems) for the number of chiral representations of bounded size $B$ (measured roughly by the Dynkin labels) compared to non-chiral ones, giving a precise meaning to the sense in which the former (which are those most relevant for phenomenology) are rare compared to the latter. As examples, we show that, for both irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{su}_5$ and once-reducible product representations of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ that are non-anomalous, the number of chiral representations is asymptotically between $B (\log B)^5$ and $B^\frac{4}{3}$, while the number of non-chiral representations is asymptotically $B^2$. Despite this rarity of chiral, anomaly-free, product representations, we show that there are examples relevant for phenomenology, including one that gives an asymptotically-free gauge theory with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}_7$.</description>

      <title>Two- and three-meson scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study systems of two and three mesons composed of pions and kaons at maximal isospin using four CLS ensembles with $a\approx 0.063\;$fm, including one with approximately physical quark masses. Using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, we determine the energy spectrum of these systems including many levels in different momentum frames and irreducible representations. Using the relativistic two- and three-body finite-volume formalism, we constrain the two and three-meson K matrices, including not only the leading $s$ wave, but also $p$ and $d$ waves. By solving the three-body integral equations, we determine, for the first time, the physical-point scattering amplitudes for $3\pi^+$, $3K^+$, $\pi^+\pi^+ K^+$ and $K^+ K^+ \pi^+$ systems. These are determined for total angular momentum $J^P=0^-$, $1^+$, and $2^-$. We also obtain accurate results for $2\pi^+$, $\pi^+ K^+$, and $2K^+$ phase shifts. We compare our results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, and to phenomenological fits.</description>

      <title>Constraints on New Physics with Light Mediators and Generalized Neutrino Interactions via Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate new physics effects on the framework of Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) from Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) of neutrinos and generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) as well as the possibility of light mediators from simplified model which includes all possible Lorentz-invariant interactions of vector (V), axialvector (A), scalar (S), pseudoscalar (P), and tensor (T) type. The constraints and the allowed regions at $90\%$ C.L. for masses and couplings in each new physics scenario are derived from the analysis of TEXONO data, including two datasets from 2016 with a high purity $n$-type point-contact (nPC) germanium (Ge) detector and from 2024 with an advanced $p$-type point-contact (pPC) Ge detector. The results are presented in comparison with the current data of COHERENT with CsI and LAr detectors to highlight the complementarity of reactor- and accelerator-based neutrino experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00351v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical results for the indirect CP violation parameter, $ |\varepsilon_K| $, evaluated directly within the Standard Model using lattice QCD inputs including $ B_K $, $ |V_{cb}| $, $ |V_{us}| $, $ |V_{ud}| $, $ \xi_0 $, $ \xi_2 $, $ F_K $, and the charm quark mass $ m_c $. Our analysis reveals a significant tension at the $ \sim 5\sigma $ level ($ 4.6\sigma $ to $ 5.2\sigma $) between the Standard Model prediction and the experimental value of $ |\varepsilon_K| $. The Standard Model prediction, informed by lattice QCD inputs, accounts for only approximately 65% of the experimental value, leaving a 35% discrepancy unexplained. Notably, this tension vanishes when using the inclusive determination of $ |V_{cb}| $, derived from heavy quark expansion. The discrepancy is therefore tied to the well-known tension between the exclusive and inclusive determinations of $ |V_{cb}| $. We further report results for $ |\varepsilon_K| $ obtained using the Brod--Gorbahn--Stamou (BGS) method based on $ u\text{--}t $ unitarity, which yields an even stronger discrepancy, in the range of $ 4.9\sigma $ to $ 5.5\sigma $, when combined with lattice QCD inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Circular orbits and accretion disk around a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and electrically charged particles in the vicinity of a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To examine the motion of an electrically charged test particle, we propose an expression for electromagnetic 4-potential that contains the impacts of loop quantum gravity. This electromagnetic 4-potential satisfies approximately the covariant Maxwell's equations to first order in the loop quantum effects. We explore the effects of the loop quantum correction parameter on the particle geodesics. We investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for both neutral and electrically charged particles in detail, demonstrating that the loop quantum parameter significantly influences on the ISCO radius, causing it to shrink. Finally, we explore the accretion disk around the loop quantum black hole. We delve into the electromagnetic radiation flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and the spectral luminosity as radiation properties of the accretion disk in detail. We show that the loop quantum correction parameter shifts the profile of the electromagnetic flux and accretion disk temperature towards the central object, leading to a slight increase in these quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the relaxation time approximation under a constant mass profile, we investigate the collective dynamics of a system of massive relativistic particles described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution. We analytically derive the two-point retarded correlation functions for both charge and energy-momentum tensor components at arbitrary momentum and frequency. We expand our results in the limits of very small and very large mass-to-temperature ratios ($m/T$). Similar to the massless case, we identify a critical threshold in ($k \tau$) below which the correlators permit physical solutions. This behavior arises from a logarithmic branch cut in the spectral function. At higher momenta, solutions emerge significantly below this cut, corresponding to non-hydrodynamic modes. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic poles dominate in the strong coupling regime, while the weak coupling regime features a logarithmic branch cut extending along $\omega = k$ and $\omega = -k$. Notably, in the sound channel, finite mass modifies the standard propagating sound mode, converting it into a purely imaginary mode. In contrast, the shear channel exhibits modes that asymptotically converge to their massless counterparts. Additionally, we compute the transport coefficients for shear and bulk viscosity, along with higher-order gradient corrections up to third order, expressed as perturbative expansions in both the small and large ($m/T$) regimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>
