      <title>Through-Thickness Modelling of Metal Rolling using Multiple-Scale Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling process is introduced, which, for the first time, is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long thin roll-gaps. The model is based on multiple-scales asymptotics, assuming a long thin roll-gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on a long lengthscale corresponding to the roll-gap length and matches with slab models. The next-order correction varies on both this long lengthscale and a short lengthscale associated with the workpiece thickness, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through the thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, this model compares well with finite element simulations that employ more realistic material behaviour (including elasticity and strain hardening). These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. This model can form the foundation of further improved models with more complicated mechanics in the future. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Field Dislocation Mechanics, Conservation of Burgers vector, and the augmented Peierls model of dislocation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative models for the quasi-static and dynamic response due to slip in an elastic body containing a single slip plane of vanishing thickness are developed. Discrete dislocations with continuously distributed cores can glide on this plane, and the models are developed as special cases of a fully three-dimensional theory of plasticity induced by dislocation motion. The reduced models are compared and contrasted with the augmented Peierls model of dislocation dynamics. A primary distinguishing feature of the reduced models is the a-priori accounting of space-time conservation of Burgers vector during dislocation evolution. A physical shortcoming of the developed models as well as the Peierls model with regard to a dependence on the choice of a distinguished, coherent reference configuration is discussed, and a testable model without such dependence is also proposed.</description>

      <title>From Mass-Shell Factorisation to Spin: An Attempt at a Matrix-Valued Liouville Framework for Relativistic Classical and Quantum Phase-Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Liouville's theorem is first-order in time for the phase-space distribution itself, the relativistic mass-shell constraint $p^\mu p_\mu = m^2$ is naively second-order in energy. We argue that it is reasonable to unify both energy branches within a single Hamiltonian by factorizing $(p^2 - m^2)$ in analogy with Dirac's approach in relativistic quantum mechanics. We show the resulting matrix-based Liouville equation remains first order and naturally yields a $4\times4$ matrix-valued probability density function in phase space as a classical analogue of a relativistic spin-half Wigner function. We investigate its classical physics and deformation quantisation.</description>
