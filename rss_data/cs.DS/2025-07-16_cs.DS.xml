      <title>A Fast Coloring Oracle for Average Case Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraph $2$-colorability is one of the classical NP-hard problems. Person and Schacht [SODA'09] designed a deterministic algorithm whose expected running time is polynomial over a uniformly chosen $2$-colorable $3$-uniform hypergraph. Lee, Molla, and Nagle recently extended this to $k$-uniform hypergraphs for all $k\geq 3$. Both papers relied heavily on the regularity lemma, hence their analysis was involved and their running time hid tower-type constants.
  Our first result in this paper is a new simple and elementary deterministic $2$-coloring algorithm that reproves the theorems of Person-Schacht and Lee-Molla-Nagle while avoiding the use of the regularity lemma. We also show how to turn our new algorithm into a randomized one with average expected running time of only $O(n)$.
  Our second and main result gives what we consider to be the ultimate evidence of just how easy it is to find a $2$-coloring of an average $2$-colorable hypergraph. We define a coloring oracle to be an algorithm which, given vertex $v$, assigns color red/blue to $v$ while inspecting as few edges as possible, so that the answers to any sequence of queries to the oracle are consistent with a single legal $2$-coloring of the input. Surprisingly, we show that there is a coloring oracle that, on average, can answer every vertex query in time $O(1)$.</description>

      <title>Solving Random Planted CSPs below the $n^{k/2}$ Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of algorithms to solve random planted instances of any $k$-ary Boolean constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). A randomly planted instance of a Boolean CSP is generated by (1) choosing an arbitrary planted assignment $x^*$, and then (2) sampling constraints from a particular "planting distribution" designed so that $x^*$ will satisfy every constraint. Given an $n$ variable instance of a $k$-ary Boolean CSP with $m$ constraints, our algorithm runs in time $n^{O(\ell)}$ for a choice of a parameter $\ell$, and succeeds in outputting a satisfying assignment if $m \geq O(n) \cdot (n/\ell)^{\frac{k}{2} - 1} \log n$. This generalizes the $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-time algorithm of [FPV15], the case of $\ell = O(1)$, to larger runtimes, and matches the constraint number vs.\ runtime trade-off established for refuting random CSPs by [RRS17].
  Our algorithm is conceptually different from the recent algorithm of [GHKM23], which gave a $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-time algorithm to solve semirandom CSPs with $m \geq \tilde{O}(n^{\frac{k}{2}})$ constraints by exploiting conditions that allow a basic SDP to recover the planted assignment $x^*$ exactly. Instead, we forego certificates of uniqueness and recover $x^*$ in two steps: we first use a degree-$O(\ell)$ Sum-of-Squares SDP to find some $\hat{x}$ that is $o(1)$-close to $x^*$, and then we use a second rounding procedure to recover $x^*$ from $\hat{x}$.</description>

      <title>Solving Linear Programs with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving linear programs of the form $Ax\le b$, $x\ge0$ with differential privacy. For homogeneous LPs $Ax\ge0$, we give an efficient $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private algorithm which with probability at least $1-\beta$ finds in polynomial time a solution that satisfies all but $O(\frac{d^{2}}{\epsilon}\log^{2}\frac{d}{\delta\beta}\sqrt{\log\frac{1}{\rho_{0}}})$ constraints, for problems with margin $\rho_{0}&gt;0$. This improves the bound of $O(\frac{d^{5}}{\epsilon}\log^{1.5}\frac{1}{\rho_{0}}\mathrm{poly}\log(d,\frac{1}{\delta},\frac{1}{\beta}))$ by [Kaplan-Mansour-Moran-Stemmer-Tur, STOC '25]. For general LPs $Ax\le b$, $x\ge0$ with potentially zero margin, we give an efficient $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private algorithm that w.h.p drops $O(\frac{d^{4}}{\epsilon}\log^{2.5}\frac{d}{\delta}\sqrt{\log dU})$ constraints, where $U$ is an upper bound for the entries of $A$ and $b$ in absolute value. This improves the result by Kaplan et al. by at least a factor of $d^{5}$. Our techniques build upon privatizing a rescaling perceptron algorithm by [Hoberg-Rothvoss, IPCO '17] and a more refined iterative procedure for identifying equality constraints by Kaplan et al.</description>

      <title>FPT Parameterisations of Fractional and Generalised Hypertree Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fixed-parameter tractable (fpt) algorithms for precisely determining several central hypergraph decomposition parameters, including generalized hypertree width, fractional hypertree width, and adaptive width. Despite the recognized importance of these measures in complexity theory, databases, and constraint satisfaction, no exact fpt algorithms for any of them had previously been known. Our results are obtained for hypergraph classes of bounded rank and bounded degree.
  Our approach extends a recent algorithm for treewidth (Boja\'ncyk &amp; Pilipczuk, LMCS 2022) utilizing monadic second-order (MSO) transductions. Leveraging this framework, we overcome the significant technical hurdles presented by hypergraphs, whose structural decompositions are technically much more intricate than their graph counterparts.</description>

      <title>Faster algorithms for k-Orthogonal Vectors in low dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Orthogonal Vectors problem (OV), we are given two families $A, B$ of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,d\}$, each of size $n$, and the task is to decide whether there exists a pair $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ such that $a \cap b = \emptyset$. Straightforward algorithms for this problem run in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot d)$ or $\mathcal{O}(2^d \cdot n)$ time, and assuming SETH, there is no $2^{o(d)}\cdot n^{2-\varepsilon}$ time algorithm that solves this problem for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$.
  Williams (FOCS 2024) presented a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1.35^d \cdot n)$-time algorithm for the problem, based on the succinct equality-rank decomposition of the disjointness matrix. In this paper, we present a combinatorial algorithm that runs in randomized time $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1.25^d n)$. This can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(1.16^d \cdot n)$ using computer-aided evaluations.
  We generalize our result to the $k$-Orthogonal Vectors problem, where given $k$ families $A_1,\ldots,A_k$ of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,d\}$, each of size $n$, the task is to find elements $a_i \in A_i$ for every $i \in \{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that $a_1 \cap a_2 \cap \ldots \cap a_k = \emptyset$. We show that for every fixed $k \ge 2$, there exists $\varepsilon_k &gt; 0$ such that the $k$-OV problem can be solved in time $\mathcal{O}(2^{(1 - \varepsilon_k)\cdot d}\cdot n)$. We also show that, asymptotically, this is the best we can hope for: for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ there exists a $k \ge 2$ such that $2^{(1 - \varepsilon)\cdot d} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time algorithm for $k$-Orthogonal Vectors would contradict the Set Cover Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Efficient Branch-and-Bound for Submodular Function Maximization under Knapsack Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The submodular knapsack problem (SKP), which seeks to maximize a submodular set function by selecting a subset of elements within a given budget, is an important discrete optimization problem. The majority of existing approaches to solving the SKP are approximation algorithms. However, in domains such as health-care facility location and risk management, the need for optimal solutions is still critical, necessitating the use of exact algorithms over approximation methods. In this paper, we present an optimal branch-and-bound approach, featuring a novel upper bound with a worst-case tightness guarantee and an efficient dual branching method to minimize repeat computations. Experiments in applications such as facility location, weighted coverage, influence maximization, and so on show that the algorithms that implement the new ideas are far more efficient than conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Finding Order-Preserving Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Induced) Subgraph Isomorphism and Maximum Common (Induced) Subgraph are fundamental problems in graph pattern matching and similarity computation. In graphs derived from time-series data or protein structures, a natural total ordering of vertices often arises from their underlying structure, such as temporal sequences or amino acid sequences. This motivates the study of problem variants that respect this inherent ordering. This paper addresses Ordered (Induced) Subgraph Isomorphism (O(I)SI) and its generalization, Maximum Common Ordered (Induced) Subgraph (MCO(I)S), which seek to find subgraph isomorphisms that preserve the vertex orderings of two given ordered graphs. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We prove that these problems remain NP-complete even when restricted to small graph classes, such as trees of depth 2 and threshold graphs. (2) We establish a gap in computational complexity between OSI and OISI on certain graph classes. For instance, OSI is polynomial-time solvable for interval graphs with their interval orderings, whereas OISI remains NP-complete under the same setting. (3) We demonstrate that the tractability of these problems can depend on the vertex ordering. For example, while OISI is NP-complete on threshold graphs, its generalization, MCOIS, can be solved in polynomial time if the specific vertex orderings that characterize the threshold graphs are provided.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling algorithms and Poincar\'e inequalities for non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling from such distributions is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be arbitrarily large.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.
  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\'e constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.</description>

      <title>Fully Dynamic Euclidean k-Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fundamental Euclidean $k$-means clustering problem in a dynamic setting, where the input $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ evolves over time via a sequence of point insertions/deletions. We have to explicitly maintain a solution (a set of $k$ centers) $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ throughout these updates, while minimizing the approximation ratio, the update time (time taken to handle a point insertion/deletion) and the recourse (number of changes made to the solution $S$) of the algorithm.
  We present a dynamic algorithm for this problem with $\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$-approximation ratio, $\tilde{O}(k^{\epsilon})$ update time and $\tilde{O}(1)$ recourse. In the general regime, where the dimension $d$ cannot be assumed to be a fixed constant, our algorithm has almost optimal guarantees across all these three parameters. Indeed, improving our update time or approximation ratio would imply beating the state-of-the-art static algorithm for this problem (which is widely believed to be the best possible), and the recourse of any dynamic algorithm must be $\Omega(1)$.
  We obtain our result by building on top of the recent work of [Bhattacharya, Costa, Farokhnejad; STOC'25], which gave a near-optimal dynamic algorithm for $k$-means in general metric spaces (as opposed to in the Euclidean setting). Along the way, we design several novel geometric data structures that are of independent interest. Specifically, one of our main contributions is designing the first consistent hashing scheme [Czumaj, Jiang, Krauthgamer, Vesel\'y, Yang; FOCS'22] that achieves $\text{poly}(d)$ running time per point evaluation with competitive parameters.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Lower Bounds for $k$-Edge Connectivity in the Distributed Sketching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $k$-edge connectivity problem on undirected graphs in the distributed sketching model, where we have $n$ nodes and a referee. Each node sends a single message to the referee based on its 1-hop neighborhood in the graph, and the referee must decide whether the graph is $k$-edge connected by taking into account the received messages.
  We present the first lower bound for deciding a graph connectivity problem in this model with a deterministic algorithm. Concretely, we show that the worst case message length is $\Omega( k )$ bits for $k$-edge connectivity, for any super-constant $k = O(\sqrt{n})$. Previously, only a lower bound of $\Omega( \log^3 n )$ bits was known for ($1$-edge) connectivity, due to Yu (SODA 2021). In fact, our result is the first super-polylogarithmic lower bound for a connectivity decision problem in the distributed graph sketching model.
  To obtain our result, we introduce a new lower bound graph construction, as well as a new 3-party communication complexity problem that we call UniqueOverlap. As this problem does not appear to be amenable to reductions to existing hard problems such as set disjointness or indexing due to correlations between the inputs of the three players, we leverage results from cross-intersecting set families to prove the hardness of UniqueOverlap for deterministic algorithms. Finally, we obtain the sought lower bound for deciding $k$-edge connectivity via a novel simulation argument that, in contrast to previous works, does not introduce any probability of error and thus works for deterministic algorithms.</description>

      <title>On Tight Robust Coresets for $k$-Medians Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers coresets for the robust $k$-medians problem with $m$ outliers, and new constructions in various metric spaces are obtained. Specifically, for metric spaces with a bounded VC or doubling dimension $d$, the coreset size is $O(m) + \tilde{O}(kd\varepsilon^{-2})$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. For Euclidean spaces, the coreset size is $O(m\varepsilon^{-1}) + \tilde{O}(\min\{k^{4/3}\varepsilon^{-2},k\varepsilon^{-3}\})$, improving upon a recent result by Jiang and Lou (ICALP 2025). These results also extend to robust $(k,z)$-clustering, yielding, for VC and doubling dimension, a coreset size of $O(m) + \tilde{O}(kd\varepsilon^{-2z})$ with the optimal linear dependence on $m$. This extended result improves upon the earlier work of Huang et al. (SODA 2025). The techniques introduce novel dataset decompositions, enabling chaining arguments to be applied jointly across multiple components.</description>

      <title>Permutation patterns in streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutation patterns and pattern avoidance are central, well-studied concepts in combinatorics and computer science. Given two permutations $\tau$ and $\pi$, the pattern matching problem (PPM) asks whether $\tau$ contains $\pi$. This problem arises in various contexts in computer science and statistics and has been studied extensively in exact-, parameterized-, approximate-, property-testing- and other formulations.
  In this paper, we study pattern matching in a \emph{streaming setting}, when the input $\tau$ is revealed sequentially, one element at a time. There is extensive work on the space complexity of various statistics in streams of integers. The novelty of our setting is that the input stream is \emph{a permutation}, which allows inferring some information about future inputs. Our algorithms crucially take advantage of this fact, while existing lower bound techniques become difficult to apply.
  We show that the complexity of the problem changes dramatically depending on the pattern~$\pi$. The space requirement is: $\Theta(k\log{n})$ for the monotone patterns $\pi = 12\dots k$, or $\pi = k\dots21$, $O(\sqrt{n\log{n}})$ for $\pi \in \{312,132\}$, $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ for $\pi \in \{231,213\}$, and $\widetilde{\Theta}_{\pi}(n)$ for all other $\pi$. If $\tau$ is an arbitrary sequence of integers (not necessary a permutation), we show that the complexity is $\widetilde{\Theta}_{\pi}(n)$ in all except the first (monotone) cases.</description>

      <title>Scheduling on Identical Machines with Setup Time and Unknown Execution Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate a scheduling problem on identical machines in which jobs require initial setup before execution. We assume that an algorithm can dynamically form a batch (i.e., a collection of jobs to be processed together) from the remaining jobs. The setup time is modeled as a known monotone function of the set of jobs within a batch, while the execution time of each job remains unknown until completion. This uncertainty poses significant challenges for minimizing the makespan. We address these challenges by considering two scenarios: each job batch must be assigned to a single machine, or a batch may be distributed across multiple machines. For both scenarios, we analyze settings with and without preemption. Across these four settings, we design online algorithms that achieve asymptotically optimal competitive ratios with respect to both the number of jobs and the number of machines.</description>

      <title>Multipass Linear Sketches for Geometric LP-Type Problems</title>

Abstract: LP-type problems such as the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB), Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Programming (LP), and Semidefinite Programming (SDP) are fundamental combinatorial optimization problems, with many important applications in machine learning applications such as classification, bioinformatics, and noisy learning. We study LP-type problems in several streaming and distributed big data models, giving $\varepsilon$-approximation linear sketching algorithms with a focus on the high accuracy regime with low dimensionality $d$, that is, when ${d &lt; (1/\varepsilon)^{0.999}}$. Our main result is an $O(ds)$ pass algorithm with $O(s( \sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)^{3d/s}) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(d, \log (1/\varepsilon))$ space complexity in words, for any parameter $s \in [1, d \log (1/\varepsilon)]$, to solve $\varepsilon$-approximate LP-type problems of $O(d)$ combinatorial and VC dimension. Notably, by taking $s = d \log (1/\varepsilon)$, we achieve space complexity polynomial in $d$ and polylogarithmic in $1/\varepsilon$, presenting exponential improvements in $1/\varepsilon$ over current algorithms. We complement our results by showing lower bounds of $(1/\varepsilon)^{\Omega(d)}$ for any $1$-pass algorithm solving the $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation MEB and linear SVM problems, further motivating our multi-pass approach.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization with Adversarial Data Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) provides a framework for decision-making under distributional uncertainty, yet its effectiveness can be compromised by outliers in the training data. This paper introduces a principled approach to simultaneously address both challenges. We focus on optimizing Wasserstein-1 DRO objectives for generalized linear models with convex Lipschitz loss functions, where an $\epsilon$-fraction of the training data is adversarially corrupted. Our primary contribution lies in a novel modeling framework that integrates robustness against training data contamination with robustness against distributional shifts, alongside an efficient algorithm inspired by robust statistics to solve the resulting optimization problem. We prove that our method achieves an estimation error of $O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ for the true DRO objective value using only the contaminated data under the bounded covariance assumption. This work establishes the first rigorous guarantees, supported by efficient computation, for learning under the dual challenges of data contamination and distributional shifts.</description>

      <title>Access Control for Information-Theoretically Secure Key-Document Stores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel key-based access control technique for secure outsourcing key-value stores where values correspond to documents that are indexed and accessed using keys. The proposed approach adopts Shamir's secret-sharing that offers unconditional or information-theoretic security. It supports keyword-based document retrieval while preventing leakage of the data, access rights of users, or the size (\textit{i}.\textit{e}., volume of the output that satisfies a query). The proposed approach allows servers to detect (and abort) malicious clients from gaining unauthorized access to data, and prevents malicious servers from altering data undetected while ensuring efficient access -- it takes 231.5ms over 5,000 keywords across 500,000 files.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing of Glauber Dynamics for Monotone Systems via Entropic Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of Glauber dynamics on monotone systems. For monotone systems satisfying the entropic independence condition, we prove a new mixing time comparison result for Glauber dynamics. For concrete applications, we obtain $\tilde{O}(n)$ mixing time for the random cluster model induced by the ferromagnetic Ising model with consistently biased external fields, and $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ mixing time for the bipartite hardcore model under the one-sided uniqueness condition, where $n$ is the number of variables in corresponding models, improving the best known results in [Chen and Zhang, SODA'23] and [Chen, Liu, and Yin, FOCS'23], respectively.
  Our proof combines ideas from the stochastic dominance argument in the classical censoring inequality and the recently developed high-dimensional expanders. The key step in the proof is a novel comparison result between the Glauber dynamics and the field dynamics for monotone systems.</description>

      <title>Compressed data structures for Heegaard splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heegaard splittings provide a natural representation of closed 3-manifolds by gluing handlebodies along a common surface. These splittings can be equivalently given by two finite sets of meridians lying in the surface, which define a Heegaard diagram. We present a data structure to effectively represent Heegaard diagrams as normal curves with respect to triangulations of a surface of complexity measured by the space required to express the normal coordinates' vectors in binary. This structure can be significantly more compressed than triangulations of 3-manifolds, given exponential gains for some families. Even with this succinct definition of complexity, we establish polynomial time algorithms for comparing and manipulating diagrams, performing stabilizations, detecting trivial stabilizations and reductions, and computing topological invariants of the underlying manifolds, such as their fundamental and first homology groups. We also contrast early implementations of our techniques with standard software programs for 3-manifolds, achieving better precision and faster algorithms for the average cases and exponential gains in speed for some particular presentations of the inputs.</description>

      <title>Distributed Treewidth Computation and Courcelle's Theorem in the CONGEST Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.10708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic meta-theorems, stating that graph properties expressible in some particular logic can be decided efficiently in graph classes having some specific structural properties, are now standard in sequential graph algorithms. One of the most classic examples is Courcelle's theorem: all properties expressible in Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO) are decidable in linear time in graphs of bounded treewidth.
  We provide here a distributed version of Courcelle's theorem, in the standard CONGEST model for distributed computing: For any MSO formula $\varphi$ and any constant $k$, there is a CONGEST algorithm that, given an input communication network $G$ of treewidth at most $k$ and of diameter $D$, decides if $G$ satisfies property $\varphi$ in $\tilde O(D)$ rounds. Simple examples show that the dependency on $D$ is unavoidable. Also, if we drop the assumption of bounded treewidth, deciding MSO properties such as 3-colorability are known to require $\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ rounds in the CONGEST model. Our results extend to optimization problems (e.g., computing a maximum size independent set, or a minimum dominating set) and counting (e.g. triangle counting). As usual, the $\tilde{O}$ notation hides polylogarithmic factors in $n$; here it also hides a constant factor depending on $k$ and on the MSO formula $\varphi$.
  We also give a distributed algorithm producing a linear approximation for treewidth: For any $k$, it decides that the treewidth of the input network $G$ is larger than $k$ or computes a tree decomposition of width $O(k)$ and depth $O(\log n)$, in $\tilde O(k^{O(k)} D)$ rounds in CONGEST.
  Our algorithms make use of the low-congestion shortcuts framework introduced by Ghaffari and Haeupler [SODA 2016], and our main technical tool is an $\tilde O(k^4 D)$ algorithm for computing $(s,t)$-vertex separators of size at most $k+1$ in graphs of treewidth at most $k$.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Peak-Cost Flows Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When planning transportation whose operation requires non-consumable resources, the peak demand for allocated resources is often of higher interest than the duration of resource usage. For instance, it is more cost-effective to deliver parcels with a single truck over eight hours than to use two trucks for four hours, as long as the time suffices. To model such scenarios, we introduce the novel minimum peak cost flow over time problem, whose objective is to minimise the maximum cost at all points in time rather than minimising the integral of costs. We focus on minimising peak costs of temporally repeated flows. These are desirable for practical applications due to their simple structure. This yields the minimum-peak-cost temporally repeated flow problem (MPC-TRF).
  We show that the simple structure of temporally repeated flows comes with the drawback of arbitrarily bad approximation ratios compared to general flows over time. Furthermore, our complexity analysis shows the integral version of MPC-TRF is strongly NP-hard, even under strong restrictions. On the positive side, we identify two benign special cases: unit-cost series-parallel networks and networks with time horizon at least twice as long as the longest path in the network (with respect to the transit time). In both cases, we show that integral optimal flows if the desired flow value equals the maximum flow value and fractional optimal flows for arbitrary flow values can be found in polynomial time. For each of these cases, we provide an explicit algorithm that constructs an optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Digital Zero-Noise Extrapolation with Quantum Circuit Unoptimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit unoptimization is an algorithm that transforms a quantum circuit into a different circuit that uses more gate operations while maintaining the same unitary transformation. We demonstrate that this method can implement digital zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a quantum error mitigation technique. By employing quantum circuit unoptimization as a form of circuit folding, noise can be systematically amplified. The key advantages of this approach are twofold. First, its ability to generate an exponentially increasing number of distinct circuit variants as the noise level is amplified, which allows noise averaging over many circuit variants with slightly different circuit structure. Averaging over these variants can mitigate the effect of biased error propagation due to the significantly altered circuit structure from quantum circuit unoptimization, or biased noise sources on a quantum processor. Second, quantum circuit unoptimization by design resists circuit simplification back to the original unmodified circuit, making it plausible to use ZNE in contexts where circuit compiler optimization is applied server-side. We evaluate the effectiveness of quantum circuit unoptimization as a noise-scaling method for ZNE in two test cases using depolarizing noise numerical simulations: random quantum volume circuits, where the observable is the heavy output probability, and QAOA circuits for the (unweighted) maximum cut problem on random 3-regular graphs, where the observable is the cut value. We show that using quantum circuit unoptimization to perform ZNE can approximately recover signal from noisy quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Solving Modular Linear Systems with a Constraint by parallel decomposition of the Smith form and extended Euclidean division modulo powers of primes divisors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integral linear systems $Ax=b$ with matrices $A$, $b$ and solutions $x$ are also required to be in integers, can be solved using invariant factors of $A$ (by computing the Smith Canonical Form of $A$). This paper explores a new problem which arises in applications, that of obtaining conditions for solving the Modular Linear System $Ax=b\rem n$ given $A,b$ in $\zz_n$ for $x$ in $\zz_n$ along with the constraint that the value of the linear function $\phi(x)=\la w,x\ra$ is coprime to $n$ for some solution $x$. In this paper we develop decomposition of the system to coprime moduli $p^{r(p)}$ which are divisors of $n$ and show how such a decomposition simplifies the computation of Smith form. This extends the well known index calculus method of computing the discrete logarithm where the moduli over which the linear system is reduced were assumed to be prime (to solve the reduced systems over prime fields) to the case when the factors of the modulus are prime powers $p^{r(p)}$. It is shown how this problem can be addressed effciently using the invariant factors and Smith form of the augmented matrix $[A,-p^{r(p)}I]$ and conditions modulo $p$ satisfied by $w$, where $p^{r(p)}$ vary over all divisors of $n$ with $p$ prime.</description>

      <title>Few Single-Qubit Measurements Suffice to Certify Any Quantum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental task in quantum information science is state certification: testing whether a lab-prepared $n$-qubit state is close to a given hypothesis state. In this work, we show that every pure hypothesis state can be certified using only $O(n^2)$ single-qubit measurements applied to $O(n)$ copies of the lab state. Prior to our work, it was not known whether even subexponentially many single-qubit measurements could suffice to certify arbitrary states. This resolves the main open question of Huang, Preskill, and Soleimanifar (FOCS 2024, QIP 2024).
  Our algorithm also showcases the power of adaptive measurements: within each copy of the lab state, previous measurement outcomes dictate how subsequent qubit measurements are made. We show that the adaptivity is necessary, by proving an exponential lower bound on the number of copies needed for any nonadaptive single-qubit measurement algorithm.</description>

      <title>Verification of Hamiltonian Path Conjecture (BHR Conjecture) for Integers up to p=31 based on one multiset per FP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a computational approach to verify a specific conjecture concerning Hamiltonian paths in complete graphs with prescribed edge lengths, often referred to as the Buratti $-$ Horak-Rosa Conjecture. Building upon prior computational work by Mariusz Meszka which verified the conjecture for all primes up to 23, our Python program does the BHR conjecture verification for composite and prime numbers up to p=32 in a different way by taking into account one mulltiset per frequency partition (FP). We report successful computational verification for all frequency partitions for integers $p &lt; 32$, specifically presenting results for $p=31$. For the composite number $p = 30$, the Python code took approximately 11 hours to verify on a Lenovo laptop. The method systematically generates frequency partitions of edge lengths and employs a recursive backtracking algorithm to construct the corresponding Hamiltonian paths. The presented program is optimized for efficiency and designed for scalability, allowing for its utilization on more powerful computing resources to explore even higher integer values, thereby providing further evidence for the conjecture's validity.
  The conjecture of Peter Horak and Alex Rosa (generalizing that of Marco Buratti) states that a multiset L of (p-1) positive integers not exceeding $[p/2]$ is the list of edge lengths of a suitable Hamiltonian path of the complete graph with vertex-set of {1, 2, ..., [p-1]} if and only if for every divisor d of p, the number of multiples of d appearing in L is at most [p-d].</description>
