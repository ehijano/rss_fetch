      <title>Observation of Half-Quantum Vorticity in an Iron-based Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-quantum vortices -- topological excitations carrying half the superconducting flux quantum -- are predicted to emerge in spin-triplet superconductors, where the spin component of order parameter enables fractional flux quantization. We present direct transport signatures of half-quantum vorticity in single-crystal Fe(Te,Se), an iron-based superconductor with helical Dirac surface states. Using mesoscopic superconducting ring devices, we observe half-integer quantum oscillations arising from the splitting of quantized fluxoid states, further supported by distinct signatures of trapped half-integer fluxoids. The quantum oscillations are modulated by a background symmetry, set by the relative orientation of the DC bias current and perpendicular magnetic field, consistent with strong spin-orbit coupling. These findings demonstrate the long-sought half-quantum vorticity in spin-polarized superconductors and open new directions toward non-Abelian excitations in quantum materials and scalable topological qubits.</description>

      <title>Vortex States and Coherence Lengths in Flat-Band Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in flat-band systems, governed by quantum metric of Bloch states rather than the BCS framework, exhibits unique phenomena due to the vanishing electron group velocity. Here, we propose the vortex states and vortex size as direct probes to explore the quantum geometry effects in flat-band superconductors. We show that flat-band vortex bound states are sharply localized near the vortex core, and the energy gap between the lowest two bound states is on the order of the bulk superconducting gap. Both the spatial spread and energy scales of bound states are controlled by the flat-band's quantum metric length. Moreover, the vortex size at zero temperature, set by the quantum metric length, is atomic in scale and independent of interaction strength. Near $T_c$, the vortex size corresponds to the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length, diverges as $\xi\sim \sqrt{T_c/(T_c-T)}\xi_0$, where $\xi_0$ depends linearly on the quantum metric length. Thus, the quantum metric serves as the lower bound for vortex state spread and vortex size. We also introduce perturbations to make the flat band dispersive, and distinguish flat-band vortices from BCS-like vortices. Our results establish vortices as universal probes of quantum geometry in flat-band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity: Bilayer-MnBi2Te4/Fe(Se,Te) Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi2Te4 coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi2Te4. This sliding mechanism breaks the MzT and PT symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin-polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>New quantum state formed by highly concentrated protons in superconducting palladium hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen exhibits quantum phenomena, such as tunneling in materials. According to theory, the quantum properties of hydrogen change significantly in superconductors due to the emergence of an energy gap on the Fermi surface, which reduces the interaction between hydrogen nucleus (i.e., proton) and conduction electrons. This reduction is predicted to enhance the tunneling probability of protons. Here, we report the double transitions of the electrical resistivity in high-quality palladium hydride (PdHx) and deuteride (PdDx) prepared by low-temperature absorption below T = 180 K. After a sharp drop in the resistivity at T ~ 2 K owing to the superconducting transition of PdH(D)x, a large residual resistivity remained. Additionally, the resistivity dropped to zero below T = 1 K. The experimental results suggest that the quantum tunneling of highly concentrated protons (deuterons) in the superconducting state is responsible for the observed features: the residual resistivity arises from the weakening of the global coherence of superconductivity owing to the tunneling motion of protons (deuterons), while the zero resistivity is caused by long-range ordering of the protons (deuterons). This system offers a new platform for investigating the quantum many-body properties of tunneling particles.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Cryogenic Phase Slip Memory with Single-Shot Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for cryogenic memory components is driven by the need for ultra-fast, low-power, and highly reliable computing systems. Phase slip-based devices promise to fulfill all these requirements, with potential applications in both classical and quantum information processing. However, previous implementations have faced challenges due to inefficient writing and readout schemes. In this work, we address these limitations with a simple device design and measurement techniques inspired by circuit quantum electrodynamics. We present a memory element that stores information in the winding of a high-kinetic inductance superconducting loop, inductively coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator. Using single-shot measurements, we achieve a readout fidelity of 99.698\% with an active measurement time of just 25 ns.</description>

      <title>Interfacial superconductivity in Cu/Cu$_{\rm{2}}$O and its effect on shielding ambient electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model is presented for two-dimensional superconductivity at semiconductor-on-metal interfaces mediated by Coulomb interactions between electronically-active interface charges in the semiconductor and screening charges in the metal. The junction considered is native Cu$_{\rm{2}}$O on Cu in which an interfacial double charge layer of areal density $n$, comprising superconducting holes in Cu$_{\rm{2}}$O and mediating electrons in Cu, is induced in proportion to a sub-monolayer of adsorbed $^{\rm{4}}\rm{He}$ atoms. Evidence for superconductivity on copper with prior air exposure is revealed in new analysis of previously published work function data. Based on a theory developed for layered superconductors, the intrinsic transition temperature $T_{\rm{C}}$ = $\beta$ $n$$^{\rm{1/2}}$/$\zeta$ is determined by $n$ and transverse distance $\zeta$ $\simeq$ 2.0 $\rm{\r{A}}$ between the charge layers; $\beta$ = 1.933(6) $e$$^{\rm{2}}$$\bar{\lambda}$$_{\rm{C}}$/k$_{\rm{B}}$ = 1247.4(3.7) K-$\rm{\r{A}}$$^{\rm{2}}$ is a universal constant involving the reduced Compton wavelength of the electron $\bar{\lambda}$$_{\rm{C}}$. This model is applied to understanding the shielding of copper work-function patch and gravitational compression electric fields reported in the Witteborn-Fairbank gravitational electron free fall experiment. Interfacial superconductivity with $n$ $\simeq$ 1.6 $\times$ 10$^{\rm{12}}$ $\rm{cm}^{\rm{-2}}\rm{,}$ $T_{\rm{C}}$ $\simeq$ 7.9 K and Berezinski\u{i}-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature $T_{\rm{BKT}}$ $\simeq$ 4.4 K accounts for the shielding observed at temperature $T$ $\simeq$ 4.2 K. Helium desorption and concomitant decreases in $n$ and $T_{\rm{C}}$ replicate the temperature transition in ambient electric fields on falling electrons, as observed by Lockhart et al., and the vanishing of superconductivity above $T$ $\simeq$ 4.8 K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Lagrangian of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of acoustic phonon with constant background charge density is proposed for an effective field theory of conventional superconductivity. We find static charged vortex solutions of finite energy and, for the critical couplings of the quartic self-interaction coupling of complex scalar field and the cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar field, these charged vortices saturate the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound, that guarantees the nonperturbative classification of type I and II superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory calculations suggest a pronounced hole electron doping asymmetry in a single layer graphene. It turns out that a single graphene sheet can sustain doping levels up to 0.1 holes or up to a remarkably large 1.9 electrons per atom while maintaining dynamical [phonon] stability. Estimates of the superconducting critical temperature in the electron doped regime based on McMillans formula reveal two local maxima in the function of doping level which correlate with the local maxima of the electron phonon coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Nodal and Nodeless Pairing Symmetry in Superconducting 6R-SnNbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana fermions, a fundamental idea to fault-tolerant quantum computing, can emerge in systems where superconductivity coexists with nontrivial band topology. One promising route to realizing such topological superconductors (TSCs) involves inducing superconductivity in topological materials, particularly in systems lacking inversion symmetry. In this study, we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of Sn-intercalated NbSe2, forming a new polytype, 6R-SnNbSe2. This compound crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric space group R3m and exhibits bulk superconductivity below Tc around 4 K. Structural, electronic, and magnetic measurements confirm the emergence of a superconducting phase derived from Sn intercalation into the non-superconducting 3R-NbSe2. Temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth and superfluid density measurements down to 1.5 K are performed using the tunnel diode oscillator technique. The findings suggest the mixing of nodal and nodeless superconductivity in 6R-SnNbSe2. Given the non-centrosymmetric nature of the crystal structure and the theoretical prediction of topological nodal-line features in SnNbSe2, it is an interesting candidate to investigate unconventional pairing mechanisms. Our findings highlight the potential of this material to host nontrivial superconducting states among the transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Observing two-electron interactions with correlation-ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and studying the underlying two-electron interactions that give rise to emergent phenomena is a key step in developing a holistic understanding of quantum materials. This step is hindered by the lack of an experiment that can directly interrogate the interactions and the specific quasiparticles involved in the interaction simultaneously. We introduce correlation-ARPES (C-ARPES) as a new experimental method that overcomes this difficulty and directly measures the interactions between specific, chosen quasiparticles by measuring the correlations between two electrons photoemitted from the same pulse (but not the same photon). We illustrate how this technique can extract the underlying interactions, and demonstrate this with an example of phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions, such as those that give rise to charge density waves through the Kohn anomaly mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hyperinductance based on stacked Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superinductances are superconducting circuit elements that combine a large inductance with a low parasitic capacitance to ground, resulting in a characteristic impedance exceeding the resistance quantum $R_Q = h/(2e)^2 \simeq 6.45 \mathrm{k}\Omega$. In recent years, these components have become key enablers for emerging quantum circuit architectures. However, achieving high characteristic impedance while maintaining scalability and fabrication robustness remains a major challenge. In this work, we present two fabrication techniques for realizing superinductances based on vertically stacked Josephson junctions. Using a multi-angle Manhattan (MAM) process and a zero-angle (ZA) evaporation technique -- in which junction stacks are connected pairwise using airbridges -- we fabricate one-dimensional chains of stacks that act as high-impedance superconducting transmission lines. Two-tone microwave spectroscopy reveals the expected $\sqrt{n}$ scaling of the impedance with the number of junctions per stack. The chain fabricated using the ZA process, with nine junctions per stack, achieves a characteristic impedance of $\sim 16 \mathrm{k}\Omega$, a total inductance of $5.9 \mathrm{\mu H}$, and a maximum frequency-dependent impedance of $50 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ at 1.4 GHz. Our results establish junction stacking as a scalable, robust, and flexible platform for next-generation quantum circuits requiring ultra-high impedance environments.</description>

      <title>Electric Control of Polarity in Spin-Orbit Josephson Diode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of spin-orbit coupling in a Josephson diode has not been elucidated due to its interplay with the complexity of Josephson devices. Here, we systematically control local electric fields in epitaxial Al-InAs Josephson junctions under in-plane magnetic fields and observe a polarity reversal of the Josephson diode. We interpret this polarity reversal as an effect of field-tunable spin-orbit coupling on nonreciprocal Josephson currents. A theoretical model, accounting for Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings in a planar Josephson junction containing many transverse subbands, aligns with the observed polarity reversal and its dependence on magnetic field. Our finding addresses spin-orbit control in a Josephson diode, enabling manipulation of Josephson harmonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically Meissner effect in non-Hermitian systems of BCS type, i.e., with an electron-electron interaction leading to the mean field description in a Cooper channel, via superfluid stiffness. We show that depending on the values of the mean fields, chemical potential, and temperature, we obtain paramagnetic or diamagnetic Meissner effect. Notably, positive real part of the product of mean fields guarantees diamagnetic Meissner effect in an $s$-wave 3D non-Hermitian superconductor. Once the mean fields are close to being anti-Hermitian, 2D $s$-, $p_x$-, and $d$-wave superconductors exhibit interesting behaviour, including negative superfluid stiffness giving paramagnetic Meissner effect for certain parameters. Negative superfluid stiffness indicates instability of this collective state.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Ising superconductivity induced by $p$-wave magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional magnetic orders usually interplay with superconductivity in intriguing ways. Here we propose that a conventional superconductor in proximity to a compensated $p$-wave magnet exhibits behaviors analogous to those of Ising superconductivity found in transition-metal dichalcogenides, which we refer to as pseudo-Ising superconductivity. The pseudo-Ising superconductivity is characterized by several distinctive features: (i) it stays much more robust under strong $p$-wave magnetism than usual ferromagnetism or $d$-wave altermagnetism, thanks to the apparent time-reversal symmetry in $p$-wave spin splitting; (ii) in the low-temperature regime, a second-order superconducting phase transition occurs at a significantly enhanced in-plane upper critical magnetic field $B_{c2}$; (iii) the supercurrent-carrying state establishes non-vanishing out-of-plane spin magnetization, which is forbidden by symmetry in Rahsba and Ising superconductors. We further propose a spin-orbit-free scheme to realize Majorana zero modes by placing superconducting quantum wires on a $p$-wave magnet. Our work establishes a new form of unconventional superconductivity generated by $p$-wave magnetism.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in ballistic graphene Andreev interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in a voltage-biased graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (JJ). We observe periodic oscillations of resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the $\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting $\pi$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Surface topological quantum criticality: Conformal manifolds and Discrete Strong Coupling Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum critical phenomena in surfaces of symmetry-protected topological matter, i.e. surface topological quantum criticality. A generic phase boundary of gapless surfaces in a symmetry-protected state shall be a co-dimension one manifold in an interaction parameter space of dimension $D_p$ (where $p$ refers to the parameter space) where the value of $D_p$ further depends on bulk topologies. In the context of fermionic topological insulators that we focus on, $D_p$ depends on the number of half-Dirac cones $\mathcal{N}$. We construct such manifolds explicitly for a few interaction parameter spaces with various $D_p$ values. Most importantly, we further illustrate that in cases with $D_p=3$ and $6$, there are sub-manifolds of fixed points that dictate the universalities of surface topological quantum criticality. These infrared stable manifolds are associated with emergent symmetries in the renormalization-group-equation flow naturally appearing in the loop expansion. Unlike in the usual order-disorder quantum critical phenomena, typically governed by an isolated Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find in the one-loop approximation surface topological quantum criticalities are naturally captured by conformal manifolds where the number of marginal operators uniquely determines their co-dimensions. Isolated strong coupling fixed points also appear, usually as the endpoints in the phase boundary of surface topological quantum phases. However, their extreme infrared instabilities along multiple directions suggest that they shall be related to multi-critical surface topological quantum critical phenomena rather than generic surface topological quantum criticality. We also discuss and classify higher-loop symmetry-breaking effects, which can either distort the conformal manifolds or further break the conformal manifolds down to a few distinct fixed points.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of low-loss Josephson parametric devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson elements represent a promising hardware platform for quantum technologies. Potential applications include scalable quantum computing, microwave quantum networks, and quantum-limited amplifiers. However, progress in Josephson junction-based quantum technologies is facing the ongoing challenge of minimizing loss channels. This is also true for parametric superconducting devices based on nonlinear Josephson resonators. In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of low-loss Josephson parametric devices operated in the GHz frequency range, showing record internal quality factors. Specifically, we achieve internal quality factors $Q_\mathrm{int}$ significantly exceeding $10^5$ for both Josephson parametric converters and Josephson parametric amplifiers in the single-photon regime by fitting the scattering data. We confirm the extracted $Q_\mathrm{int}$ values by analyzing purity of squeezed vacuum states generated by these devices. These low-loss devices mark a significant step forward in realizing high-performance quantum circuits, enabling further advancements in superconducting quantum technologies.</description>
