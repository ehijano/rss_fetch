      <title>The 15 Puzzle and homological stability in the space direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ordered configuration space of $n$ open unit squares in the $w$ by $h$ rectangle exhibits homological stability in the space direction. That is, for fixed $n$ and fixed homological degree $k$, once the underlying rectangle is large enough, making it any larger does not change the $k$-th homology of the square configuration space. In this paper, we sharpen the stable range. Finding bounds for $w$ and $h$ in terms of $n$ and $k$, we prove that most rectangles can be almost entirely filled with squares and there still be an isomorphism between the $k$-th homology of the resulting square configuration space and the $k$-th homology of the ordered configuration space of $n$ points in the plane.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of symplectic $T^n$ - reductions and compactifications of $\mathcal{M}_{0, n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symplectic $T^n$ - reduction on a complex Grassmann manifold $G_{n,2}$ for the canonical action of the maximal compact torus depends on the $S_n$ - orbit of a maximal chamber in a hypersimplex $\Delta _{n,2}$. The chamber decomposition of $\Delta _{n,2}$ is defined by the admissible polytopes, which can be realized as matroids. In our previous work we described this chamber decomposition by means of the hyperplane arrangement. It is important to note that to any chamber it corresponds the compact space, which is a smooth compact manifold for a chamber of maximal dimension. In this paper we obtain explicit description of the cohomology rings of the symplectic $T^n$ - reductions on $G_{n,2}$ for the standard moment map in terms of the chamber decomposition of $\Delta _{n,2}$ and the well known results of Kirwan and Goldin.
  We recently introduced the Hassett category whose objects are special compactifications of the space $\mathcal{M}_{0, n}$. The initial object in this category is the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0, n}$. In this paper we describe the cohomology rings of various compactifications for $\mathcal{M}_{0, n}$, which correspond to the objects of the Hassett category. Our results show that even in the case $n=5$ there are objects in the Hassett category with different cohomology rings.</description>

      <title>Bredon cohomology methods in mass partition problems on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded Bredon cohomology to mass assignment problems, extending classical mass partition methods. Within this framework, we reprove a recent result of Lessure and Sober\'on: for $n+1$ mass assignments on $k$-dimensional affine subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a $k$-subspace containing a sphere that simultaneously bisects all measures. This approach highlights a flexible topological framework with potential for broader applications.</description>

      <title>Diffeological Spaces with a Non-Smooth Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that on certain diffeological spaces there exist linear derivations that satisfy the Leibniz rule but are not smooth with respect to the given diffeology. This reveals that the notion of tangent space defined via all such derivations is strictly larger than the one defined using only smooth derivations, showing that smoothness cannot be recovered from the Leibniz rule alone.</description>

      <title>A \v{C}ech--Stokes Pushout Groupoid: a Log/Kummer Betti Presenter for Stokes Torsors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex manifold and let $D\subset X$ be a simple normal crossings divisor. Fix a Kummer level $n\ge 1$ and an irregular type $\Phi$ along $D$, and consider the logarithmic Betti boundary $X^{\log}_n$ (the level-$n$ Kato--Nakayama space). We construct a strictly $1$-categorical, cover-based Betti presenter for Stokes torsors by building a small strict \v{C}ech--Stokes collar groupoid on a punctured logarithmic collar of $D$, together with a canonical projection $\pi$ to the underlying sector \v{C}ech groupoid. The central observation is that the appropriate collar Stokes moduli is the groupoid of strict functorial sections $\operatorname{Sec}(\pi)$ (equivalently, $\mathrm{St}_{\Phi}$-torsors on the sector cover), yielding a fully explicit presenter that remains small and strictly functorial. We then glue the collar presenter to the ordinary \v{C}ech presenter of $U:=X\setminus D$ through a strict diagram of small groupoids and an explicit $2$-pushout presenter $G_{\Phi,n}$. We prove that global Stokes objects, defined intrinsically as a $2$-fiber product, are computed by a strict torsorial gluing problem, i.e.\ by Stokes-corrected torsorial representations of $G_{\Phi,n}$. In arbitrary SNC depth we solve the local corner presentation problem by an explicit chamber-complex model on the angular torus: Stokes torsors are nonabelian cocycles on the $1$-skeleton with relations read off from $2$-cells. The overall construction is canonical up to Morita equivalence with a contractible space of identifications (invariant under stratified subdivision), and it is compatible with Kummer descent along all normal crossings strata via $(\mu_n)^k$-equivariant local models and descent to homotopy fixed points.</description>

      <title>Classifying anima of condensed $\infty$-categories of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the classifying anima of two natural condensed $\infty$-categories associated to a coherent $\infty$-topos. One from our work with Barwick and Glasman on exit-path categories in algebraic geometry, and the other from Lurie's work on ultracategories. The key consequence of our comparison is a connection between algebraic geometry and model theory: up to a mild completion, the pro\'{e}tale fundamental group of a scheme and the Lascar group of a complete first-order theory are both special cases of the same construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the total cut complexes and their Alexander duals. The homotopy type of these complexes is calculated for de $p$th power of a cycle with at least $2rn$ vertices where $p\leq r$, solving part of a conjecture of Bayer, Denker, Milutinovi\'c, Rowlands, Sundaram and Xue. The homotopy type of the $2$-total cut complex for any $r$th power of a cycle with $r\geq3$ also is calculated, solving a conjecture of Chauhan, Shukla and Vinayak. We give some results about the connectivity. The homotopy type of the complexes for complete multipartite graph is determined. We also study the complexes of cartesian products of paths and of cartesian products of complete graphs for the total $2$-cut complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study ordered configuration spaces of $n$ hard discs inside a unit disc, and how the topology changes with the radius $r$ of the hard discs. We describe the full homotopy type of this space for all radii when $n = 4$ and exhibit nontrivial classes in $\pi_{n-3}$ for all $n$. We also explore the persistence of these nontrivial classes when the ambient disc is deformed into an ellipse.</description>

      <title>Angular pair-of-pants decompositions of complex varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of torically hyperbolic varieties and we construct pair-of-pants decompositions for these in terms of angle sets of essential projective hyperplane complements. This construction generalizes the classical pair-of-pants decomposition for hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. In our first main theorem, we prove that the natural angle map associated to an essential projective hyperplane complement is a homotopy equivalence, extending earlier work of Salvetti and Bj\"orner-Ziegler. By a topological argument, we further show that the angle map for a finite Kummer covering of an essential projective hyperplane complement is likewise a homotopy equivalence. We then explain how these local building blocks can be glued along the dual intersection complex of a semistable degeneration. Using the theory of Kato-Nakayama spaces, we prove that the resulting space is homotopy equivalent to the original algebraic variety. We make this explicit for complete intersections in projective space using techniques from tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Minimal Projective Resolutions, M\"obius Inversion, and Bottleneck Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a stability theory for minimal projective resolutions of $\mathbf{P}$-modules, where $\mathbf{P}$ is a finite metric poset. On the module side, we introduce the Galois transport distance, defined by factoring two modules through a common "apex" poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\mathbf{P}$-modules.
  On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions.
  We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and M\"obius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for M\"obius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions.</description>
