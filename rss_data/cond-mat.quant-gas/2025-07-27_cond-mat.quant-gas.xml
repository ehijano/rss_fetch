      <title>Phases of a Bose-Einstein condensate of microwave-shielded dipolar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules can be achieved by shielding loss channels with microwave fields. The microwave coupling can be approximated by effective dipole-dipole interactions with a short-range repulsion. We study properties and stability of these molecular Bose gases with a many-body variational method, the hypernetted-chain Euler-Lagrange method for a wide range of densities and repulsion strengths of the microwave shield. We find a homogeneous gas-like phase which, however, is unstable at low density against density waves: at a critical density, which depends on the repulsion strength, the dipolar fluid undergoes a phase transition to a layer phase. Thus, if the molecular condensate is expanded adiabatically by decreasing the confinement strength, it will spontaneously form layers at the critical density. These quasi-two-dimensional layers can be self-bound, hence form two-dimensional liquids. By varying the microwave shield, the predicted equilibrium densities span more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Spinon Singlet: Microscopic Mechanism of $d$-Wave Pairing in a Partially-Filled Stripe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant research advances have led to a consensus that the Fermi-Hubbard model and its extended variants are archetypal frameworks for elucidating the intertwined relationship between stripe orders and superconductivity in hole-doped high-$T_c$ materials. Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has recently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully cooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable fluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing of electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly understood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects and non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation of a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard models with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas microscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the high-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the ground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data demonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously pair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we reconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its connection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs enable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double stripes. Our work offers new insights into the role of stripe orders in mediating $d$-wave superconductivity and paves the way for further exploration of multi-stripe-mediated pairing mechanisms in the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek mechanism for dissipative discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) holds for open systems transitioning from a disordered phase to a discrete time crystal (DTC). Specifically, we observe the main signatures of the KZM when the system is quenched into a DTC, which are the characteristic power-law scaling with quench time of the number of spatial defects and the transition delay measured from the time at which the system crosses the critical point. We show analytically that this universal behavior can be traced back to how systems that can be mapped onto a dissipative linear parametric oscillator (DLPO) satisfy the adiabatic-impulse (AI) approximation, evinced by the divergence of the relaxation time of the DLPO near a critical point. We verify our predictions in both the classical and quantum regimes by considering two systems: the Sine-Gordon model, which is a paradigmatic system for emulating classical DTCs; and the open Dicke lattice model, an array of spin-boson systems subjected to quantum fluctuations. For both systems, the DTCs can be tuned from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic order by varying the driving frequency, thus allowing us to test the validity of KZM for arbitrary spatiotemporal ordering.</description>

      <title>Photon condensation from thermal sources and the limits of heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trapping and cooling of photon gases in microcavities has been used to create Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the conditions required for condensation in dye-filled microcavities, with photon populations created either by driving a transition of the dye or by coupling to an external thermal photon reservoir such as sunlight. We show that the threshold pump temperature, above which condensation appears, is determined by the second law of thermodynamics. The minimum achievable threshold is that of a reversible three-level heat engine, which we show arises in the dye-pumped case, and for the external pumping of a two-level cavity. For a many-level cavity condensation occurs at a similar but higher temperature. The increase is attributed to irreversible heat transfers and the associated entropy production.</description>

      <title>Pulse-based optimization of quantum many-body states with Rydberg atoms in optical tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a pulse-based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for Rydberg atoms in optical tweezer arrays and evaluate its performance on prototypical quantum spin models. We numerically demonstrate that the ground states of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the mixed-field Ising model can be accurately prepared using an adaptive update algorithm that randomly segments pulse sequences, for systems of up to ten qubits. Furthermore, we propose and validate a hybrid scheme that integrates this pulse-level analog quantum algorithm with a variational quantum gate approach, where digital quantum gates are approximated by optimized analog pulses. This enables efficient measurement of the cost function for target many-body Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum Droplets of Light in Semiconductor Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum droplets are dilute self-bound configurations of bosons that result from the balance between a mean-field attraction and a repulsion induced by quantum fluctuations. Such droplets have been successfully realized in cold atomic gases and represent a signature of their quantum nature. Here, we predict the existence of a similar droplet phase in a solid-state system, involving polaritons formed from the strong coupling between excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) and photons in a semiconductor microcavity. We consider a spin mixture of exciton-polaritons near a biexciton Feshbach resonance, which allows one to tune the interspecies interactions to be attractive and comparable in magnitude to the intraspecies repulsion. We find that self-bound quantum droplets are achievable for realistic parameters in atomically thin semiconductors, and that they can be detected via their excitation spectrum and spatial profile. This exotic phase could potentially lead to polariton condensation at lower thresholds and it opens an alternative avenue to achieve the long-sought quantum polaritonic regime.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dipolar Condensate Finite Temperature Stochastic Gross--Pitaevskii--Boltzmann Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a generalized self-consistent stochastic quantum kinetic theory for finite-temperature ultracold Bose gases interacting via a generic long-range interaction, applicable to a broad range of systems, by means of Keldysh non-equilibrium field theory: such model is explicitly cast in the context of dipolar atomic gases, and is also shown to encompass established stochastic and kinetic treatments for ultracold atomic gases with local interactions as special cases. The condensate and low-lying modes are collectively described by a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation with two collisional terms and their corresponding stochastic noise terms, with thermal particles dynamically modelled through a self-consistently coupled Quantum Boltzmann equation and dipolar interactions included by means of a coupled Poisson-like equation. Additional use of Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis generating the Lee-Huang-Yang correction term relevant in the $T=0$ quantum-fluctuation-dominated regime, allows us to postulate the extension of such model offering a plausible scheme for interpolating between quantum-dominated and thermal-dominated fluctuation regimes, the consistency of which remains to be tested against experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Many Body Localization Crossover as a Metal-Insulator Transition: Localization length from Polarization and Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.</description>
