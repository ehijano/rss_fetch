      <title>Quantifying Data Requirements for EEG Independent Component Analysis Using AMICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is an important step in EEG processing for a wide-ranging set of applications. However, ICA requires well-designed studies and data collection practices to yield optimal results. Past studies have focused on quantitative evaluation of the differences in quality produced by different ICA algorithms as well as different configurations of parameters for AMICA, a multimodal ICA algorithm that is considered the benchmark against which other algorithms are measured. Here, the effect of the data quantity versus the number of channels on decomposition quality is explored. AMICA decompositions were run on a 71 channel dataset with 13 subjects while randomly subsampling data to correspond to specific ratios of the number of frames in a dataset to the channel count. Decomposition quality was evaluated for the varying quantities of data using measures of mutual information reduction (MIR) and the near dipolarity of components. We also note that an asymptotic trend can be seen in the increase of MIR and a general increasing trend in near dipolarity with increasing data, but no definitive plateau in these metrics was observed, suggesting that the benefits of collecting additional EEG data may extend beyond common heuristic thresholds and continue to enhance decomposition quality.</description>

      <title>Exploring EEG Responses during Observation of Actions Performed by Human Actor and Humanoid Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action observation (AO) therapy is a promising rehabilitative treatment for motor and language function in individuals recovering from neurological conditions, such as stroke. This pilot study aimed to investigate the potential of humanoid robots to support AO therapy in rehabilitation settings. The brain activity of three healthy right-handed participants was monitored with electroencephalography (EEG) while they observed eight different actions performed by two agents, a human actor and a robot, using their left and right arms. Their event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs, changes in the spectral power of neural oscillations in response to an event or stimulus, compared to baseline) in sensorimotor regions were analyzed. The single-subject analysis showed variability in ERSP patterns among all participants, including power suppression in sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. One participant showed stronger responses to "robot" AO conditions than to "human" conditions. Strong and positive correlations in ERSP across all conditions were observed for almost all participants and channels, implying common cognitive processes or neural networks at play in the mirror neuron system during AO. The results support the feasibility of using EEG to explore differences in neural responses to observation of robot- and human-induced actions.</description>

      <title>On Broken Symmetry in Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cognition is not passive data accumulation but the active resolution of uncertainty through symmetry breaking. This paper argues that both cognitive evolution and development unfold via sequential symmetry-breaking transitions that disrupt innate regularities across space, time, self, and representation. First, spatial symmetry is broken through bilateral body plans and neural codes like grid and place cells, which privilege egocentric orientation and localized encoding. Second, reinforcement learning introduces temporal asymmetry by favoring future rewards, establishing a directional flow of inference. Third, goal-directed simulation breaks spatiotemporal symmetry between internal self-models and the external world, enabling embodied inference and solving the combinatorial search problem. Fourth, social cognition via mentalizing and imitation breaks the symmetry between minds, allowing agents to infer others' beliefs. Finally, language imposes a linear, recursive structure onto unordered thought, breaking expressive symmetry through syntax and grammar. These asymmetries are unified by the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP), which frames cognition as a cyclical entropy-minimizing process. At the core lies the principle of structure-before-specificity: ambiguous input is first mapped onto stable latent structures before being bound to specific instances. This promotes generalization, reduces sample complexity, and prevents overfitting. Inverting inference, from content back to context, further breaks the curse of dimensionality by constraining inference to goal-consistent manifolds. Thus, symmetry breaking is not incidental but the foundational mechanism by which cognition organizes, stabilizes, and scales intelligent behavior in an uncertain and dynamic world.</description>

      <title>Multi-object Data Integration in the Study of Primary Progressive Aphasia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article focuses on a multi-modal imaging data application where structural/anatomical information from gray matter (GM) and brain connectivity information in the form of a brain connectome network from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are available for a number of subjects with different degrees of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a neurodegenerative disorder (ND) measured through a speech rate measure on motor speech loss. The clinical/scientific goal in this study becomes the identification of brain regions of interest significantly related to the speech rate measure to gain insight into ND patterns. Viewing the brain connectome network and GM images as objects, we develop an integrated object response regression framework of network and GM images on the speech rate measure. A novel integrated prior formulation is proposed on network and structural image coefficients in order to exploit network information of the brain connectome while leveraging the interconnections among the two objects. The principled Bayesian framework allows the characterization of uncertainty in ascertaining a region being actively related to the speech rate measure. Our framework yields new insights into the relationship of brain regions associated with PPA, offering a deeper understanding of neuro-degenerative patterns of PPA. The supplementary file adds details about posterior computation and additional empirical results.</description>

      <title>AI Agent Behavioral Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of AI agents that exhibit increasingly human-like behaviors, including planning, adaptation, and social dynamics across diverse, interactive, and open-ended scenarios. These behaviors are not solely the product of the internal architectures of the underlying models, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems operating within specific contexts, where environmental factors, social cues, and interaction feedbacks shape behavior over time. This evolution necessitates a new scientific perspective: AI Agent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this perspective emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual agent, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional model-centric approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.</description>

      <title>Aesthetics Without Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it is easy for human observers to judge an image as beautiful or ugly, aesthetic decisions result from a combination of entangled perceptual and cognitive (semantic) factors, making the understanding of aesthetic judgements particularly challenging from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, our research shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly beautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic responses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with minimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to generate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum Semantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of 10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image metrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful images with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship between image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study reveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and aesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting effects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.</description>
