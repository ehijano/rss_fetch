      <title>Mixing rate exponent of planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duminil-Copin and Manolescu (2022) recently proved the scaling relations for planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolation. In particular, they showed that the one-arm exponent and the mixing rate exponent are sufficient to derive the other near-critical exponents. The scaling limit of critical FK percolation is conjectured to be a conformally invariant random collection of loops called the conformal loop ensemble (CLE). In this paper, we define the CLE analog of the mixing rate exponent. Assuming the convergence of FK percolation to CLE, we show that the mixing rate exponent for FK percolation agrees with that of CLE. We prove that the CLE$_\kappa$ mixing rate exponent equals $\frac{3 \kappa}{8}-1$, thereby answering Question 3 of Duminil-Copin and Manolescu (2022). The derivation of the CLE exponent is based on an exact formula for the Radon-Nikodym derivative between the marginal laws of the odd-level and even-level CLE loops, which is obtained from the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and CLE.</description>

      <title>Non-Gibbsian Multivariate Ewens Probability Distributions on Regular Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ewens' sampling formula (ESF) provides the probability distribution governing the number of distinct genetic types and their respective frequencies at a selectively neutral locus under the infinitely-many-alleles model of mutation. A natural and significant question arises: ``Is the Ewens probability distribution on regular trees Gibbsian?"
  In this paper, we demonstrate that Ewens probability distributions can be regarded as non-Gibbsian distributions on regular trees and derive a sufficient condition for the consistency condition. This study lays the groundwork for a new direction in the theory of non-Gibbsian probability distributions on trees.</description>

      <title>Operator level soft edge to bulk transition in $\beta$-ensembles via canonical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic Airy and sine operators, which are respectively a random Sturm-Liouville operator and a random Dirac operator, characterize the soft edge and bulk scaling limits of $\beta$-ensembles. Dirac and Sturm-Liouville operators are distinct operator classes which can both be represented as canonical systems, which gives a unified framework for defining important properties, such as their spectral data. Seeing both as canonical systems, we prove that in a suitable high-energy scaling limit, the Airy operator converges to the sine operator. We prove this convergence in the vague topology of canonical systems' coefficient matrices, and deduce the convergence of the associated Weyl-Titchmarsh functions and spectral measures. Our proof relies on a coupling between the Brownian paths that drive the two operators, under which the convergence holds in probability. This extends the corresponding result at the level of the eigenvalue point processes, proven by Valk\'o and Vir\'ag (2009) by comparison to the Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate Bernoulli oriented bond percolation with parameter $p$ on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. In addition to the standard edges, which are open with probability $p$, we introduce diagonal edges each open with probability $\varepsilon$. Every edge is open or closed independently of all other edges. We prove that the critical parameter for this model is strictly decreasing in $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit and tail bounds for a random walk model of SOS level lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a random walk model for the level lines appearing in the entropic repulsion phenomena of three-dimensional discrete random interfaces above a hard wall; we are particularly motivated by the low-temperature (2+1)D solid-on-solid (SOS) model, where the emergence of these level lines has been rigorously established. The model we consider is a line ensemble of non-crossing random walk bridges above a wall with geometrically growing area tilts. Our main result, which in particular resolves a question of Caputo, Ioffe, and Wachtel (2019), is an edge 1:2:3 scaling limit for this ensemble as the domain size $N$ diverges, with a growing number of walks (including the number of level lines of the SOS model) and high boundary conditions (covering the maximum upper deviation of the SOS level lines). As a key input, we establish Tracy--Widom-type upper tail bounds for each of the relevant curves in the line ensemble. An ingredient which may be of independent interest is a ballot theorem for random walk bridges under a broader range of boundary values than available in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every couple of Hausdorff functions $\psi, \varphi$ verifying some mild assumptions, we construct a compact subset $ K $ of the Baire space such that the $\varphi$-Hausdorff measure and the $\psi$-packing measure on $ K $ are both finite and positive. We then embed such examples in any infinite-dimensional Banach space to answer positively to a question of Fan on the existence of metric spaces with arbitrary scales.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic contiguity from low-degree conjecture and applications in correlated random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming a natural strengthening of the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between the correlated sparse stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks.</description>

      <title>On creating convexity in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\gamma_n$ denote the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Given a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we let \begin{align*} \mathrm{conv}_k(A) := \{ \lambda_1 s_1 + \ldots + \lambda_k s_k : \lambda_i \geq 0, \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i = 1 , s_i \in A \} \end{align*} be the set of $k$-fold convex combinations of $A$. We show that for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(A) \geq 1- \varepsilon$ such that for all $k = O_\varepsilon(\sqrt{\log \log n})$, $\mathrm{conv}_k(A)$ contains no convex set $K$ of Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(K) \geq \varepsilon$. This provides a negative resolution to a stronger version of a conjecture of Talagrand. Our approach involves applying optimal transport techniques to the empirical coordinate measures of vectors in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Refined regularity of SLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove refined (variation and H\"older-type) regularity statements for the SLE trace (under capacity parametrisation). More precisely, we show that the trace has finite $\psi$-variation for $\psi(x) = x^d(\log 1/x)^{-d-\varepsilon}$ and H\"older-type modulus $\varphi(t) = t^\alpha(\log 1/t)^{\beta}$ where $d$ and $\alpha$ are the optimal $p$-variation and H\"older exponents of SLE$_\kappa$ which have been previously identified by Viklund, Lawler (2011) and Friz, Tran (2017). For SLE$_8$, we simplify a step in the proof by Kavvadias, Miller, and Schoug (2021), and get the modulus $\varphi(t) = (\log 1/t)^{-1/4}(\log\log 1/t)^{2+\varepsilon}$.
  Finally, for $\kappa \ge 8$, we prove regularity estimates for the uniformising maps that hold uniformly in time, namely $\sup_t |\hat f_t'(u+iv)| \lesssim v^{2\alpha-1}(\log 1/v)^\beta$ in case $\kappa&gt;8$ and $v^{-1}(\log 1/v)^{-1/4}(\log\log 1/v)^{1+\varepsilon}$ in case $\kappa=8$.
  Our results are obtained from analysing the forward Loewner differential equation (in contrast to the other mentioned works which analyse the backward equation).</description>

      <title>Universality of the local limit of preferential attachment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study preferential attachment models where vertices enter the network with i.i.d. random numbers of edges that we call the out-degree. We identify the local limit of such models, substantially extending the work of Berger et al.(2014). The degree distribution of this limiting random graph, which we call the random P\'{o}lya point tree, has a surprising size-biasing phenomenon. Many of the existing preferential attachment models can be viewed as special cases of our preferential attachment model with i.i.d. out-degrees. Additionally, our models incorporate negative values of the preferential attachment fitness parameter, which allows us to consider preferential attachment models with infinite-variance degrees. Our proof of local convergence consists of two main steps: a P\'olya urn description of our graphs, and an explicit identification of the neighbourhoods in them. We provide a novel and explicit proof to establish a coupling between the preferential attachment model and the P\'{o}lya urn graph. Our result proves a density convergence result, for fixed ages of vertices in the local limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic behavior of an extended family of integral geometric random functionals, including spatiotemporal Minkowski functionals under moving levels, is analyzed in this paper. Specifically, sojourn measures of spatiotemporal long-range dependence (LRD) Gaussian random fields are considered in this analysis. The limit results derived provide general reduction principles under increasing domain asymptotics in space and time. The case of time-varying thresholds is also studied. Thus, the family of morphological measures considered allows the statistical and geometrical analysis of random physical systems displaying structural changes over time. Motivated by cosmological applications, the derived results are applied to the context of sojourn measures of spatiotemporal spherical Gaussian random fields. The results are illustrated for some families of spatiotemporal Gaussian random fields displaying complex spatiotemporal dependence structures.</description>

      <title>The Moran process on a random graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fixation probability for two versions of the Moran process on the random graph $G_{n,p}$ at the threshold for connectivity. The Moran process models the spread of a mutant population in a network. Throughtout the process there are vertices of two types, mutants and non-mutants. Mutants have fitness $s$ and non-mutants have fitness 1. The process starts with a unique individual mutant located at the vertex $v_0$. In the Birth-Death version of the process a random vertex is chosen proportional to its fitness and then changes the type of a random neighbor to its own. The process continues until the set of mutants $X$ is empty or $[n]$. In the Death-Birth version a uniform random vertex is chosen and then takes the type of a random neighbor, chosen according to fitness. The process again continues until the set of mutants $X$ is empty or $[n]$. The {\em fixation probability} is the probability that the process ends with $X=\emptyset$.
  We give asymptotically correct estimates of the fixation probability that depend on degree of $v_0$ and its neighbors.,</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Levine and Silvestri that the driven-dissipative activated random walk model on an interval drives itself directly to and then sustains a critical density. This marks the first rigorous confirmation of a sandpile model behaving as in Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld's original vision of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem for Jump Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP) seeks to find the measure $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ on a certain path space which interpolates between state-space distributions $\rho_0$ at time $0$ and $\rho_T$ at time $T$ while minimizing the KL divergence (relative entropy) to a reference path measure $\mathbf{R}$. In this work, we tackle the SBP in the case when $\mathbf{R}$ is the path measure of a jump diffusion. Under mild assumptions, with both the operator theory approach and the stochastic calculus techniques, we establish an $h$-transform theory for jump diffusions and devise an approximation method to achieve the jump-diffusion SBP solution $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ as the strong-convergence limit of a sequence of harmonic $h$-transforms. To the best of our knowledge, these results are novel in the study of SBP. Moreover, the $h$-transform framework and the approximation method developed in this work are robust and applicable to a relatively general class of jump diffusions. In addition, we examine the SBP of particular types of jump diffusions under additional regularity conditions and extend the existing results on the SBP from the diffusion case to the jump-diffusion setting.</description>

Abstract: Water quantity and quality are vital indices for assessing fluvial environments. These indices are highly variable over time and include sub-exponential memory, where the influences of past events persist over long durations. Moreover, water quantity and quality are interdependent, with the former affecting the latter. However, this relationship has not been thoroughly studied from the perspective of long-memory processes, which this paper aims to address. We propose applying a new stochastic volatility model, a system of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, to describe dynamic asset prices in finance and economics. Although the stochastic volatility model was originally developed for phenomena unrelated to the water environment, its mathematical universality allows for an interdisciplinary reinterpretation: river discharge is analogous to volatility, and water quality to asset prices. Moreover, the model's infinite-dimensional nature enables the analytical description of sub-exponential memory. The moments and autocorrelations of the model are then obtained analytically. We mathematically analyze the stochastic volatility model and investigate its applicability to the dynamics of water quantity and quality. Finally, we apply the model to real time-series data from a river in Japan, demonstrating that it effectively captures both the memory and the correlation of water quality indices to river discharge. This approach, grounded in infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, represents a novel contribution to the modelling and analysis of environmental systems where long memory processes play a role.</description>

      <title>Spectral heat content for non-isotropic L\'evy processes with weak lower scaling condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the small-time asymptotic behavior of symmetric, but not necessarily isotropic, L\'evy processes with weak lower scaling condition near zero on its L\'evy density. Our main result, Theorem 2.1, extends and generalizes key findings in \cite{KP24} and \cite{PS22} by encompassing non-isotropic L\'evy processes and providing a unified proof that includes the critical case in which the one-dimensional projection of the underlying processes is non-integrable. In particular, the main result recovers \cite[Theorem 1.1]{PS22} for both $\alpha\in (1,2)$ and $\alpha=1$ cases and provide a robust proof that can be applied to study the small-time asymptotic behavior of the spectral heat content for other interesting examples discussed in Section 4.</description>

      <title>A spatial host-parasite model with host immunity: Survival and linear spread of parasites on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized version of the frog model to describe the invasion of a parasite population in a spatially structured immobile host population with host immunity on the integer line. Parasites move according to simple symmetric random walks and try to infect any host they meet. Hosts, however, own an immunity against the parasites that protects them from infection for a random number of attacks. Once a host gets infected, it and the infecting parasite die, and a random number of offspring parasites is generated. We show that the positivity of the survival probability of parasites only depends on the mean offspring and mean height of immunity. Furthermore, we prove through the construction of a renewal structure that given survival of the parasite population parasites invade the host population at linear speed under relatively mild assumptions on the host immunity distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model of a parasite population invading spatially distributed immobile hosts. Each host has an unbreakable immunity against infection with a certain probability $p$. We show that, on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\ge 2$ and the $d$-regular tree $\mathbb{T}_d$ with $d\ge 3$, the survival probability of parasites undergoes a phase transition in the probability $p$ of a host to be immune. Also we show that on vertex-transitive graphs a fixed vertex is only visited finitely often by a parasite almost surely under mild assumptions on the parasites offspring distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00544v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence analysis for general degenerate and non-reversible stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We apply the Lyapunov method to analyze the Fokker-Planck equation, in which the Lyapunov functional is chosen as a weighted relative Fisher information functional. We derive a structure condition and formulate the Lyapunov constant explicitly. We prove the exponential convergence result for the probability density function towards its invariant distribution in the $L_1$ distance. Two examples are presented: underdamped Langevin dynamics with variable diffusion matrices and three oscillator chain models with nearest-neighbor couplings.</description>

      <title>Stationary solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct stationary statistical solutions of a deterministic unforced nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, by perturbing it by a linear damping $\gamma u$ and a stochastic force whose intensity is proportional to $\sqrt \gamma$, and then letting $\gamma\to 0^+$. We prove indeed that the family of stationary solutions $\{U_\gamma\}_{\gamma&gt;0}$ of the perturbed equation possesses an accumulation point for any vanishing sequence $\gamma_j\to 0^+$ and this stationary limit solves the deterministic unforced nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and is not the trivial zero solution. This technique has been introduced in [KS04], using a different dissipation. However considering a linear damping of zero order and weaker solutions we can deal with larger ranges of the nonlinearity and of the spatial dimension; moreover we consider the focusing equation and the defocusing equation as well.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control in Hilbert spaces: $C^{1,1}$ regularity of the value function and optimal synthesis via viscosity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal control problems governed by abstract infinite dimensional stochastic differential equations using the dynamic programming approach. In the first part, we prove Lipschitz continuity, semiconcavity and semiconvexity of the value function under several sets of assumptions, and thus derive its $C^{1,1}$ regularity in the space variable. Based on this regularity result, we construct optimal feedback controls using the notion of the $B$-continuous viscosity solutions for the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. This is done in the case when the noise coefficient is independent of the control variable. We also discuss applications of our results to optimal control problems governed by stochastic reaction-diffusion equations and, under economic motivations, stochastic delay differential equations.</description>

      <title>On Arratia's coupling and the Dirichlet law for the factors of a random integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $x \ge 2$, let $N_x$ be an integer chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathbb Z \cap [1, x]$, and let $(V_1, V_2, \ldots)$ be a Poisson--Dirichlet process of parameter $1$. We prove that there exists a coupling of these two random objects such that $$ \mathbb E \, \sum_{i \ge 1} |\log P_i- V_i\log x| \asymp 1, $$ where the implied constants are absolute and $N_x = P_1P_2 \cdots$ is the unique factorization of $N_x$ into primes or ones with the $P_i$'s being non-increasing. This establishes a 2002 conjecture of Arratia arXiv:1305.0941 who proved that the left-hand side in the above estimate can be made $\ll \log\!\log x$, and who also proved that the left-hand side is $\ge 1-o(1)$ for all couplings. In addition, we use our refined coupling to give a probabilistic proof of the Dirichlet law for the average distribution of the integer factorization into $k$ parts proved in 2023 by Leung arXiv:2206.14728 and we improve on its error term.</description>

      <title>Bias-Corrected and Variance-Corrected MLE for the New Median Based Unit Weibull Distribution (MBUW)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the maximum likelihood method is the most commonly used method for parameters estimation being unbiased, consistent, efficient, and asymptotically normal, MLE is used to fit the new distribution (MBUW). But in small to moderate sample size, this MLE estimator is biased unlike the MLE estimators obtained from large sample sizes. In this paper, the Bias-corrected approach for this distribution is discussed and applied to real data analysis. The MLE estimators of MBUW obtained from some optimization techniques like derivative free Nelder Mead algorithm suffers from significant high correlation that is reflected on high covariance between the parameters. Also this association between the parameters affects the variances which may be inflated enough to approach infinity hampering construction of confidence intervals for each parameter. This problem may arise with any optimization technique which necessitates remedies trying to fix it. The author also elaborates a variance correction approach heavily relaying on re-parameterizing the negative log likelihood.</description>

      <title>Sink-free orientations: a local sampler with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For sink-free orientations in graphs of minimum degree at least $3$, we show that there is a deterministic approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n^{73}/\varepsilon^{72})\log(n/\varepsilon))$, a near-linear time sampling algorithm, and a randomised approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n/\varepsilon)^2\log(n/\varepsilon))$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the input graph and $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$ is the desired accuracy. All three algorithms are based on a local implementation of the sink popping method (Cohn, Pemantle, and Propp, 2002) under the partial rejection sampling framework (Guo, Jerrum, and Liu, 2019).</description>
