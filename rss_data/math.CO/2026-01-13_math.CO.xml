      <title>A 920-block explicit construction guaranteeing a triple intersection with every 6-subset of [60]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit family $\mathcal{B}$ of $920$ subsets of size $6$ of $[60]=\{1,\dots,60\}$ with the property that every $6$-subset $S\subset[60]$ intersects at least one block $B\in\mathcal{B}$ in at least three elements, i.e.\ $|S\cap B|\ge 3$. The construction is purely combinatorial, based on a partition of the ground set into pairs and a pigeonhole argument. We also record a simple counting lower bound and discuss how different partitions of the ten base blocks affect the emergence of triple intersections.</description>

      <title>Plane partitions and spin adapted quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an explicit basis for the $\operatorname{SU}(2)$-invariant space of the exterior power $\wedge_{2k} \mathbb{C}^{2m}$ via the combinatorics of plane partitions. In quantum chemistry, this is the space of spin adapted quantum states of an electronic system with $m$ spin orbitals and $k$ electron pairs. We construct our basis by identifying the invariant space with an Artinian commutative ring called the excitation ring. We compute a Gr\"obner basis and enumerate its standard monomials via an explicit bijection to Dyck paths counted by the Narayana numbers.</description>

      <title>Uniform hypergraphs of girth $6$ and $8$ from generalized polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ex_r(N,g)$ be the maximum number of edges in an $r$-uni\-form hypergraph on $N$ vertices with girth at least $g$. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of this value when $N$ is increasing but parameters $g\in\{6,8\}$ and $r\geq3$ are fixed. It is shown that for some positive constants $c$ and $d$, any integer $r\geq3$ and all sufficiently large integers $N$ the inequalities $ex_r(N,6)\geq N^{\frac{11}{8}-\frac{c}{\sqrt{\log N}}}$ and $ex_r(N,8)\geq N^{\frac{11}{9}-\frac{d}{\sqrt{\log N}}}$ hold.</description>

      <title>A generalization of $q$-deformation of graphic arrangements to simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this thesis is to introduce two new kinds of hyperplane arrangements, inspired by the graphic arrangements and $q$-deformations of graphic arrangements. In this thesis, the author extends the definition of $q$-deformation to simplicial complexes, with the conjecture by Nian, Tsujie, Uchiumi and Yoshinaga. The author also investigates a special case called graphic monomial arrangement, including the characteristic polynomials and freeness with a further extension to fields with primitive roots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FlagAlgebraToolbox, an extension of SageMath capable of automating flag algebra calculations and optimizations. FlagAlgebraToolbox has a simple interface, can handle a wide range of combinatorial theories, can numerically optimize extremal combinatorial problems and round the results to produce exact proofs.

      <title>Reconfiguration of Hamiltonian Cycles in Rectangular Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An \textit{\(m \times n\) grid graph} is the induced subgraph of the square lattice whose vertex set consists of all integer grid points \(\{(i,j) : 0 \leq i &lt; m,\ 0 \leq j &lt; n\}\). Let $H$ and $K$ be Hamiltonian cycles in an $m \times n$ grid graph $G$. We study the problem of reconfiguring $H$ into $K$, \textcolor{blue}{\textbullet} where the Hamiltonian cycles are viewed as vertices of a reconfiguration graph \textcolor{blue}{\textbullet}, using a sequence of local transformations called \textit{moves}. A \textit{box} of $G$ is a unit square face. A box with vertices $a, b, c, d$ is \textit{switchable} in $H$ if exactly two of its edges belong to $H$, and these edges are parallel. Given such a box with edges $ab$ and $cd$ in $H$, a \textit{switch move} removes $ab$ and $cd$, and adds $bc$ and $ad$. A \textit{double-switch move} consists of performing two consecutive switch moves. If, after a double-switch move, we obtain a Hamiltonian cycle, we say that the double-switch move is \textit{valid}.
  We prove that any Hamiltonian cycle $H$ can be transformed into any other Hamiltonian cycle $K$ via a sequence of valid double-switch moves, such that every intermediate graph remains a Hamiltonian cycle. Moreover, assuming $n \geq m$, the number of required moves is bounded by $mn^2$.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of Hamiltonian Paths and Cycles in Rectangular Grid Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \noindent An \textit{\(m \times n\) grid graph} is the induced subgraph of the square lattice whose vertex set consists of all integer grid points \(\{(i,j) : 0 \leq i &lt; m,\ 0 \leq j &lt; n\}\). Let $H$ and $K$ be Hamiltonian cycles in an $m \times n$ grid graph $G$. We study the problem of reconfiguring $H$ into $K$ using a sequence of local transformations called \textit{moves}. A \textit{box} of $G$ is a unit square face. A box with vertices $a, b, c, d$ is \textit{switchable} in $H$ if exactly two of its edges belong to $H$, and these edges are parallel. Given such a box with edges $ab$ and $cd$ in $H$, a \textit{switch move} removes $ab$ and $cd$, and adds $bc$ and $ad$. A \textit{double-switch move} consists of performing two consecutive switch moves. If, after a double-switch move, we obtain a Hamiltonian cycle, we say that the double-switch move is \textit{valid}.
  We prove that any Hamiltonian cycle $H$ can be transformed into any other Hamiltonian cycle $K$ via a sequence of valid double-switch moves, such that every intermediate graph remains a Hamiltonian cycle.
  This result extends to Hamiltonian paths. In that case, we also use single-switch moves and a third operation, the \textit{backbite move}, which enables the relocation of the path endpoints.</description>

      <title>Unimodular Equivalence of Integral Simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing the unimodular equivalence of two full-dimensional integral simplices can be reduced to testing unimodular permutation (UP) equivalence of two nonsingular matrices. We conduct a systematic study of UP-equivalence, which leads to the first average-case quasi-polynomial time algorithm, called \texttt{HEM}, for deciding the unimodular equivalence of $d$-dimensional integral simplices, as well as achieving a polynomial-time complexity with a failure probability less than $2.5 \times 10^{-7}$. A key ingredient is the introduction of the \emph{permuted Hermite normal form} and its associated \emph{pattern group}, which streamlines the UP-equivalence test by comparing canonical forms derived from induced coset representatives. We also present an acceleration strategy based on Smith normal forms. As a theoretical by-product, we prove that two full-dimensional integral simplices are unimodularly equivalent if and only if their $n$-dimensional pyramids are unimodularly equivalent. This resolves an open question posed by Abney-McPeek et al.</description>

      <title>Polyominoes with maximal number of deep holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the extremal behaviour of deep holes in polyominoes. We determine the maximum number, $h_n$ of deep holes that an $n$-omino can enclose, ensuring that the boundary of each hole is disjoint from the boundaries of any other hole and from the outer boundary of the $n$-tile. Using the versatile application of Pick's theorem, we establish the lower and the upper bound for $h_n$, and show that $h_n=\frac{n}{3}+o(n)$ asymptotically. To further develop these results, we compute $h_n$ as a function of $n$ for an infinite subset of positive integers.</description>

      <title>Nearly Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set is pairwise intersecting, $2k\leq n$ then $|\mathcal{F}|\leq {n-1\choose k-1}$ holds by the celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem. But an intersecting family obviously satisfies the condition $${\ell \choose 2}\leq \sum_{1\leq i&lt;j\leq \ell}|F_i\cap F_j| $$ for any $\ell$ distinct members of the family. It has been proved in [5] that even if ${\ell \choose 2}$ is replaced by ${\ell -1 \choose 2}+1$ the conclusion $|\mathcal{F}|\leq {n-1\choose k-1}$ remains valid for large $n$. However the 1 cannot be omitted, because there is a larger family satisfying that weaker condition. In the present paper we determine the largest size of the family under this weaker condition when $n$ is sufficiently large. All of these are treated in the more general setting of $t$-intersecting families.</description>

      <title>On the zero-free region for the chromatic polynomial of claw-free graphs with and without induced square and induced diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a claw-free graph $G=(V,E)$ with maximum degree $\Delta$,
  we define the parameter $\kappa\in [0,1]$ as $\kappa={\max_{v\in V}|I_v|\over \lfloor\Delta^2/4\rfloor}$ where $I_v$ is the set of all independent pairs in the neighborhood of $v$. We refer to $\kappa$ as the pair independence ratio of $G$.
  We prove that for any claw-free graph $G$ with pair independence ratio at most $\kappa$ the zeros of its chromatic polynomial $P_G(q)$ lie inside the disk $D=\{q\in \mathbb{C}:~|q|&lt; C_\kappa^0\Delta\}$, where $C_\kappa^0$ is an increasing function of $\kappa\in [0,1]$. If $G$ is also square-free and diamond free, the function $C_\kappa^0$ can be replaced by a sharper function $C_\kappa^1$. These bounds constitute an improvement upon results
  recently given by Bencs and Regts in ''Improved bounds on the zeros of the chromatic polynomial of graphs and claw-free graphs''.</description>

      <title>The symplectic left companion of a Littlewood-Richardson-Sundaram tableau and the Kwon property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a consequence of the Littlewood-Richardson (LR) commuters coincidence and the Kumar-Torres branching model via Kushwaha-Raghavan-Viswanath flagged hives, we have solved the Lecouvey-Lenart conjecture on the bijections between the Kwon and Sundaram
  branching models for the pair $({GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{C}), {Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})) $ consisting of the general linear group ${GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ and the symplectic group ${Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$. In particular, thanks to the Henriques-Kamnitzer $gl_n$-crystal commuter, we have recognized that the left companion of an LR-Sundaram tableau is characterized by the Kwon symplectic condition. We now show that the construction of the left companion tableau of an LR-Sundaram tableau exhibits in fact the Kwon symplectic property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate single conflict coloring in the setting of r-uniform hypergraphs. We establish some basic properties of this hypergraph coloring model and study a probabilistic model of single conflict coloring where the conflicts for each edge are chosen randomly; in particular, we prove a sharp threshold-type result for complete graphs and establish a sufficient condition for single conflict colorability of r-uniform hypergraphs in this model. Furthermore, we obtain a related palette sparsification-type result for general list coloring of linear uniform hypergraphs (i.e. uniform hypergraphs where any two edges share at most one common vertex). Throughout the paper we pose several questions and conjectures</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\rho_k(N)$ denote the maximum size of a set $A\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ such that no product of $k$ distinct elements of $A$ is a perfect $d$-th power. In this short note, we prove that $\rho _d(N)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{d-1}\pi\left( \frac{N}{k} \right) +O_d(\pi (N^{1/2}))$, furthermore, for prime power $d$ and sufficiently large $N$ we have $\rho _d(N)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{d-1}\pi\left( \frac{N}{k} \right)$. This answers a question of Verstra\"ete.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a \textit{subset-sum-distinct} or \textit{dissociated} if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>

      <title>A sharp point-sphere incidence bound for $(u, s)$-Salem sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a sharp point-sphere incidence bound in finite fields for point sets exhibiting controlled additive structure. Working in the framework of \((4,s)\)-Salem sets, which quantify pseudorandomness via fourth-order additive energy, we prove that if \(P\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d\) is a \((4,s)\)-Salem set with \(s\in \big( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2} \big]\) and \(|P|\ll q^{ \frac{d}{4s}}\), then for any finite family \(S\) of spheres in \(\mathbb{F}_q^d\), \[ \bigg| I(P,S)-\frac{|P||S| }{q} \bigg| \ll q^{\frac{d}{4}}\,|P|^{1-s}\,|S|^{\frac{3}{4}}. \] This estimate improves the classical point-sphere incidence bounds for arbitrary point sets across a broad parameter range. The proof combines additive energy estimates with a lifting argument that converts point-sphere incidences into point-hyperplane incidences in one higher dimension while preserving the \((4,s)\)-Salem property. As applications, we derive refined bounds for unit distances, dot-product configurations, and sum-product type phenomena, and we extend the method to \((u,s)\)-Salem sets for even moments \(u\ge4\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the direct sum decompositions of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{(pqr)^2}$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct primes. We show that if $A \oplus B = \mathbb{Z}_{(pqr)^2}$ with $|A| = |B| = pqr$, then Sands' conjecture fails to hold, in other words, neither $A$ nor $B$ is contained in a proper subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_{(pqr)^2}$, if and only if the sets $A, B$ form a Szab\'{o} pair.</description>

      <title>On symmetric pattern avoidance sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a set of permutations $S\subseteq S_n$, consider the quasisymmetric generating function
  $$Q(S): = \sum_{w\in S}F_{n, \mathrm{Des}(w)},$$
  where $\mathrm{Des}(w) := \{i\mid w(i)&gt; w(i+1)\}$ is the descent set of $w$ and $F_{n, \mathrm{Des}(w)}$ is Gessel's fundamental quasisymmetric function. A set of permutations is said to be symmetric (respectively, Schur-positive) if its quasisymmetric generating function is symmetric (respectively, Schur-positive). Given a set $\Pi$ of permutations, let $S_n(\Pi)$ denote the set of permutations in $S_n$ that avoid all patterns in $\Pi.$ A set $\Pi$ is said to be symmetrically avoided (respectively, Schur-positively avoided) if $S_n(\Pi)$ is symmetric (respectively, Schur-positive) for all $n.$
  Marmor proved in 2025 that for $n\ge 5$, a symmetric set $S\subseteq S_n$ has size at least $n-1$ unless $S\subseteq \{12\cdots n, n\cdots 21\}$ and asked for a general classification of the possible sizes of symmetric sets not containing the monotone elements $12\cdots n $ and $n\cdots 21$. We give a complete answer to this question for $n\ge 52.$ We also give a classification of symmetric sets of size at most $n-1$, thereby showing that they are actually Schur-positive, resolving a conjecture of Marmor. Finally, we give a classification of symmetrically avoided sets of size at most $n-1$, thereby showing that they are actually Schur-positively avoided.</description>

      <title>On the Enumeration of Generalized Cospectral Mates of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the enumeration of generalized cospectral mates of simple graphs, where the generalized spectrum consists of the spectra of a graph and its complement. Moving beyond the classical problem of identifying graphs determined by their generalized spectrum, we address the more quantitative question of how many non-isomorphic graphs can share the same generalized spectrum. Our approach is based on arithmetic constraints derived from the Smith Normal Form (SNF) of the walk matrix $W(G)$, which lead to a tight upper bound on the number of generalized cospectral mates of a graph. Our upper bound applies to a much broader class of graphs than those previously shown to have no generalized cospectral mates (determined by generalized spectrum). Consequently, this work extends the family of graphs for which strong and informative spectral uniqueness</description>

      <title>Bipartite Tur\'an problem on cographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cograph is a graph that contains no induced path $P_4$ on four vertices or equivalently a graph that can be constructed from vertices by sum and product operations. We study the bipartite Tur\'an problem restricted to cographs: for fixed integers $s \leq t$, what is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex cograph that does not contain $K_{s,t}$ as a subgraph? This problem falls within the framework of induced Tur\'an numbers $\text{ex}(n, \{K_{s,t}, P_4\text{-ind}\})$ introduced by Loh, Tait, Timmons, and Zhou.
  Our main result is a Pumping Theorem: for every $s\le t$ there exists a period $R$ and core cographs such that for all sufficiently large $n$ an extremal cograph is obtained by repeatedly pumping one designated pumping component inside the appropriate core (depending on $n\bmod R$). We determine the linear coefficient of $\text{ex}(n, \{K_{s,t}, P_4\text{-ind}\})$ to be $s-1 + \frac{t-1}{2}$. Moreover, the pumping components are $(t-1)$-regular and have $s-1$ common neighbours in the respecitve core graphs, giving the extremal cographs a particularly rigid extremal star-like shape.
  Motivated by the rarity of complete classification of extremal configurations, we completely classify all $K_{3,3}$-free extremal cographs by proof. We also develop a dynamic programming algorithm for enumerating extremal cographs for small $n$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of weighted plane trees by a permutation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses an enumeration problem on weighted bi-colored plane trees with prescribed vertex data, with all vertices labeled distinctly. We give a bijection proof of the enumeration formula originally due to Kochetkov, hence affirmatively answer a question of Adrianov-Pakovich-Zvonkin. The argument is purely combinatorial and totally constructive, remaining valid for real-valued edge weights. A central process is a geometric construction that directly encodes each tree as a permutation. We also exhibit algebraic relationships between the enumeration problem, the partial order on partitions of vertices and the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Some computation examples are presented as appendices.</description>

      <title>The random stable roommates problem typically has no solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that $n = 2k$ potential roommates each have an ordered preference of the $n-1$ others. A stable matching is a perfect matching of the $n$ roommates in which no two unmatched people prefer each other to their matched partners. In their seminal 1962 stable marriage paper, Gale and Shapley noted that not every instance of the stable roommates problem admits a stable matching. In the case when the preferences are chosen uniformly at random, Gusfield and Irving predicted in 1989 that there is no stable matching with high probability for large $n$. We prove this conjecture and show that for $n$ sufficiently large, the probability there is a stable matching is at most $n^{-1/17}$.</description>

Abstract: We provide precise asymptotics for the number of antichains in the poset $\{0,1,2\}^n$, answering a question of Sapozhenko. Finding improved estimates for this number was also a problem suggested by Noel, Scott, and Sudakov, who obtained asymptotics for the logarithm of the number. Key ingredients for the proof include a graph-container lemma to bound the number of expanding sets in a class of irregular graphs, isoperimetric inequalities for generalizations of the Boolean lattice, and methods from statistical physics based on the cluster expansion.</description>

      <title>Cross-intersecting families with covering number constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are cross-intersecting if every set in $\mathcal{F}$ intersects every set in $\mathcal{G}$. The covering number $\tau(\mathcal{F})$ of a family $\mathcal{F}$ is the minimum size of a set that intersects every member of $\mathcal{F}$. In 1992, Frankl and Tokushige determined the maximum of $|\mathcal{F}| + |\mathcal{G}|$ for cross-intersecting families $\mathcal{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{a}$ and $\mathcal{G} \subset \binom{[n]}{b}$ that are non-empty (covering number at least 1) and also characterized the extremal configurations. This seminar result was recently extended by Frankl (2024) and Frankl and Wang (2025) to cases where both families are non-trivial (covering number at least 2), and where one is non-empty and the other non-trivial, respectively. In this paper, we establish a unified stability hierarchy for cross-intersecting families under general covering number constraints. We determine the maximum of $|\mathcal{F}| + |\mathcal{G}|$ for cross-intersecting families $\mathcal{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{a}$ and $\mathcal{G} \subset \binom{[n]}{b}$ with the following covering number constraints:
  (1) $\tau(\mathcal{F}) \geq s$ and $\tau(\mathcal{G}) \geq t$;
  (2) $\tau(\mathcal{F}) = s$ and $\tau(\mathcal{G}) \geq t \geq 2$;
  (3) $\tau(\mathcal{F}) \geq s$ and $\tau(\mathcal{G}) = t$;
  (4) $\tau(\mathcal{F}) = s$ and $\tau(\mathcal{G}) = t$; provided $a \geq b + t - 1$ and $n \geq \max\{a + b, bt\}$. The corresponding extremal families achieving the upper bounds are also characterized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated formula of Otter \emph{[Ann. of Math. (2) 49 (1948), 583--599]} asserts that the complete graph contains exponentially many non-isomorphic spanning trees. In this paper, we show that every connected almost regular graph with sufficiently large degree already contains exponentially many non-isomorphic spanning trees. Indeed, we prove a stronger statement: for every fixed $n$-vertex tree $T$, $$
  \Pr\bigl[\mathcal{T} \simeq_{\mathrm{iso}} T\bigr] = e^{-\Omega(n)}, $$ where $\mathcal{T}$ is a uniformly random spanning tree of a connected $n$-vertex almost regular graph with sufficiently large degree. To prove this, we introduce a graph-theoretic variant of the classical balls--into--bins model, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric MinDist, introduced recently to quantify the distance of an arbitrary Rummy hand from a valid declaration, plays a central role in algorithmic hand evaluation and optimal play. Existing results show that the MinDist of any $13$-card Rummy hand from a single deck is bounded above by $9$. In this paper, we sharpen this bound and prove that the MinDist of any hand is at most $7$. We further show that this bound is tight by explicitly exhibiting a hand whose MinDist equals $7$ for a suitable choice of wildcard joker. The proof combines elementary combinatorial arguments with structural properties of card partitions across suits and resolves the gap between the previously known upper bound and the true extremal value.</description>

Abstract: The topic of this paper is related to the well-known notion of unit distance graphs. Take a graph with its edges coloured red and blue such that for some $d$ it can be mapped into the plane with all vertices going to distinct points, the red edges to segments of length $1$ and the blue edges to segments of length $d$. We define the range of this graph to be the set of such numbers $d$. It is easy to show that the range of any edge-bicoloured graph consists of finitely many intervals with algebraic endpoints, and we now prove that any such set with a finite positive upper and lower bound is the range of a suitable graph.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of $p$-adic random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the basic theory of eigenvalues of $p$-adic random matrices, analogous to the classical theory for random matrices over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$. Such eigenvalue statistics were proposed as a model for the zeroes of $p$-adic $L$-functions by Ellenberg-Jain-Venkatesh, who computed the limiting distribution of the number of eigenvalues in a unit disc. We compute the full joint distribution of the $n$ eigenvalues of an $n \times n$ matrix with Haar distribution, obtaining Coulomb gas type formulas as in the archimedean case, with Vandermonde terms leading to eigenvalue repulsion.
  From these Coulomb gas density functions we derive asymptotics of eigenvalue statistics as $n \to \infty$. These include exact computations, such as a closed form
  $$\rho(x,y) = 1 - \theta_3(-\sqrt{p};||x-y||^2/p)$$
  for the limiting pair correlation of eigenvalues in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and similar results in quadratic extensions. Such formulas yield concrete numerical predictions on zeroes of $p$-adic $L$-functions.
  For eigenvalues in arbitrary extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ we also give precise estimates on their pair-repulsion and expected number of eigenvalues in each extension. Finally, we compute the asymptotic probability that all eigenvalues lie in $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
  Our proofs combine results from several distinct areas: $p$-adic orbital integrals, roots of random $p$-adic polynomials, the Sawin-Wood moment method for random modules, and Markov chains associated with measures on integer partitions.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by cylinders of real algebraic manifolds and natural decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The author has been interested in regions surrounded by cylinders of real algebraic hypersurfaces and their shapes and polynomials associated to them. Here, we formulate and investigate natural decompositions into such cylinders of real algebraic hypersurfaces. Especially, intersections of these cylinders of real algebraic hypersurfaces, which give important information on regions, are investigated via singularity theory.
  This is a kind of natural problems on real geometry. This also comes from construction of explicit real algebraic maps onto explicit regions in real affine spaces on real algebraic manifolds. More generally, we are interested in difficulty in explicit construction of real algebraic objects, where existence and approximation has been well-known, since pioneering studies by Nash and Tognoli, in the latter half of 20th century. This also comes from interest in singularity theory of differentiable, smooth or real algebraic functions and maps, especially, explicit construction.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Subsequences in the Nonbinary Deletion Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the deletion channel, an important problem is to determine the number of subsequences derived from a string $U$ of length $n$ when subjected to $t$ deletions. It is well-known that the number of subsequences in the setting exhibits a strong dependence on the number of runs in the string $U$, where a run is defined as a maximal substring of identical characters. In this paper we study the number of subsequences of a non-binary string in this scenario, and propose some improved bounds on the number of subsequences of $r$-run non-binary strings. Specifically, we characterize a family of $r$-run non-binary strings with the maximum number of subsequences under any $t$ deletions, and show that this number can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Algebraic topology of the Lagrange inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lagrange inversion formula for power series is one of the classical formulas from analysis and combinatorics. A nice geometric interpretation of this formula in terms of the Stasheff polytopes was discovered by Loday. We show that it also admits a natural topological interpretation in terms of the Chern numbers of the complex projective space. The proof is based on our earlier work on the Chern-Dold character in complex cobordism theory and leads to a new derivation of the Lagrange inversion formula. We provide a similar interpretation of the multiplicative inversion formulas in terms of Chern numbers of the smooth theta divisors. We discuss also the general related problem when all Chern numbers of an algebraic variety are divisible by its Euler characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the Pl\"ucker ideal defining the Grassmannian is generated by quadratic Pl\"ucker relations. These relations form a reverse lexicographic Gr\"obner basis and endow the Pl\"ucker algebra with the structure of an algebra with straightening laws (ASL). In this paper, we study quadratically generated projections of the Grassmannian of lines $\mathrm{Gr}(2,n)$. We then combinatorially characterize the Gorenstein ASL subalgebras of the Pl\"ucker algebra of $\mathrm{Gr}(2,n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending recent developments of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Roberson, we study infinite sumset patterns in $U^k(\Phi)$-uniform subsets of the integers, defined via the local uniformity seminorms introduced by Host and Kra. The main result relates the degree $k$ of a $U^k(\Phi)$-uniform set to the existence of sumset patterns along prescribed vertices of $\ell$-dimensional parallelepipeds, for $k \leq \ell$. The proof relies on a dynamical analysis of return-time sets to neighborhoods of points lying over pronilfactor fibers. We then derive higher-order parity obstructions for sumset patterns and consequences in topological dynamics.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on Drawing Venn Diagrams for Data Visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VennFan, a method for generating $n$-set Venn diagrams based on the polar coordinate projection of trigonometric boundaries, resulting in Venn diagrams that resemble a set of fan blades. Unlike most classical constructions, our method emphasizes readability and customizability by using shaped sinusoids and amplitude scaling. We describe both sine- and cosine-based variants of VennFan and propose an automatic label placement heuristic tailored to these fan-like layouts. VennFan is available as a Python package (https://pypi.org/project/vennfan/).</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for the d'Arcais Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The d'Arcais polynomials $P_n(z)$ for $n\in\{0,1,\dots\}$ are defined as $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P_n(z) q^n = \exp(-z\ln((q;q)_{\infty}))$ where the $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} (1-q^k)$ for $|q|&lt;1$. Denoting the coefficients for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by the formula $P_n(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A(2,n,k) z^k/n!$, we prove that $k_n! A(2,n,k_n)/n!$ satisfies a Bahadur-Rao type large deviation formula in the limit $n \to \infty$ with $k_n/n \to \kappa \in [0,1)$ as long as $k_n \to \infty$. The large deviation rate function is the Legendre-Fenchel transform $g^*(-\kappa)$ where $g(\kappa) = f^{-1}(\kappa)$ for the function $f : (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(y)= \ln(-\ln((e^{-y};e^{-y})_{\infty}))$. We relate this fact to information about the abundancy index.</description>

      <title>Approximate FKG inequalities for phase-bound spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FKG inequality is an invaluable tool in monotone spin systems satisfying the FKG lattice condition, which provides positive correlations for all coordinate-wise increasing functions of spins. However, the FKG lattice condition is somewhat brittle and is not preserved when confining a spin system to a particular phase. For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization.
  In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich. We use this to extend the proof of the central limit theorem for ERGMs within a phase at low temperatures, due to the second author, to the non-forest phase-coexistence regime, answering a question posed by Bianchi, Collet, and Magnanini for the edge-triangle model.</description>

      <title>Geometry of low nonnegative rank matrix completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study completion of partial matrices with nonnegative entries to matrices of nonnegative rank at most $r$ for some $r \in \mathbb{N}$. Most of our results are for $r \leq 3$. We show that a partial matrix with nonnegative entries has a nonnegative rank-1 completion if and only if it has a rank-1 completion. This is not true in general when $r \geq 2$. For $3 \times 3$ matrices, we characterize all the patterns of observed entries when having a rank-2 completion is equivalent to having a nonnegative rank-2 completion. If a partial matrix with nonnegative entries has a rank-$r$ completion that is nonnegative, where $r \in \{1,2\}$, then it has a nonnegative rank-$r$ completion. We will demonstrate examples for $r=3$ where this is not true. We do this by introducing a geometric characterization for nonnegative rank-$r$ completion employing families of nested polytopes which generalizes the geometric characterization for nonnegative rank introduced by Cohen and Rothblum (1993).</description>

      <title>On the complexity of the Maker-Breaker happy vertex game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a c-colored graph G, a vertex of G is happy if it has the same color as all its neighbors. The notion of happy vertices was introduced by Zhang and Li to compute the homophily of a graph. Eto, et al. introduced the Maker-Maker version of the Happy vertex game, where two players compete to claim more happy vertices than their opponent. We introduce here the Maker-Breaker happy vertex game: two players, Maker and Breaker, alternately color the vertices of a graph with their respective colors. Maker aims to maximize the number of happy vertices at the end, while Breaker aims to prevent her. This game is also a scoring version of the Maker-Breaker Domination game introduced by Duchene, et al. as a happy vertex corresponds exactly to a vertex that is not dominated in the domination game. Therefore, this game is a very natural game on graphs and can be studied within the scope of scoring positional games. We initiate here the complexity study of this game, by proving that computing its score is PSPACE-complete on trees, NP-hard on caterpillars, and polynomial on subdivided stars. Finally, we provide the exact value of the score on graphs of maximum degree 2, and we provide an FPT-algorithm to compute the score on graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity. An important contribution of the paper is that, to achieve our hardness results, we introduce a new type of incidence graph called the literal-clause incidence graph for 2-SAT formulas. We prove that QMAX 2-SAT remains PSPACE-complete even if this graph is acyclic, and that MAX 2-SAT remains NP-complete, even if this graph is acyclic and has maximum degree 2, i.e. is a union of paths. We demonstrate the importance of this contribution by proving that Incidence, the scoring positional game played on a graph is also PSPACE-complete when restricted to forests.</description>

      <title>Critical level-set percolation on finite graphs and spectral gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bond percolation on finite graphs induced by the level-sets of zero-average Gaussian free field on the associated metric graph above a given height (level) parameter $h \in \mathbb{R}$. We characterize the near- and off-critical phases of this model for any expanders family $\mathcal{G}_n = (V_n, E_n)$ with uniformly bounded degrees. In particular, we show that the volume of the largest open cluster at level $h_n$ is of the order $|V_n|^{\frac23}$ when $h_n$ lies in the corresponding critical window which we identify as $|h_n| = O(|V_n|^{-\frac13})$. Outside this window, the volume starts to deviate from $\Theta(|V_n|^{\frac23})$ culminating into a linear order in the supercritical phase $h_n = h &lt; 0$ (the giant component) and a logarithmic order in the subcritical phase $h_n = h &gt; 0$. We deduce these from effective estimates on tail probabilities for the maximum volume of an open cluster at any level $h$ for a generic base graph $\mathcal{G}$. The estimates depend on $\mathcal{G}$ only through its size and upper and lower bounds on its degrees and spectral gap respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance where a mean-field critical behavior is derived under such general setup for finite graphs. The generality of these estimates preclude any local approximation of $\mathcal{G}$ by regular infinite trees -- a standard approach in the area. Instead, our methods rely on exploiting the connection between spectral gap of the graph $\mathcal{G}$ and its connection to the level-sets of zero-average Gaussian free field mediated via a set function we call the zero-average capacity.</description>

Abstract: A proper infinite parallelepiped (IP) set in a semigroup is an infinite set consisting of a sequence $\myseq{a}$ and its finite sums, or a superset of such a set.
  Hindman's theorem asserts that the proper IP sets of natural numbers are partition regular: for each finite coloring of a proper IP set of natural numbers there is a monochromatic proper IP subset.
  Furstenberg generalized this question to arbitrary semigroups, in which the analogous result does not hold in general. We provide a complete classification of the semigroups for which the proper IP sets are partition regular, and show that this property is equivalent to other fundamental notions of additive Ramsey theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Birkhoff polytope $\Omega_n$ is the polytope of doubly stochastic matrices of order $n$. The Birkhoff polytope graph $G(\Omega_n)$ is the skeleton of $\Omega_n$; it is the Cayley graph whose vertex set consists of the elements of the symmetric group ${\rm Sym}(n)$ of degree $n$, where two permutations are adjacent if one equals the product of the other with a cycle. We study the combinatorial structure of this graph, focusing on its maximal and maximum cliques and on its independent subgroups (subgroups of ${\rm Sym}(n)$ whose elements are pairwise nonadjacent in the graph). We obtain maximal subgroups of $G(\Omega_n)$ and establish both a lower bound and an upper bound for its clique number. Especially, we prove that if $K$ is a subset of ${\rm Sym}(n)$ consisting of 3-cycle permutations such that $\delta_1^{-1}\delta_2$ is a single cycle for all $\delta_1,\delta_2\in K$, then the maximum size of $K$ is $\lfloor (n-1)^2/4\rfloor$, which can be viewed as an Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado-type theorem for ${\rm Sym}(n)$.</description>

Abstract: The nearly complete bipartite graph $G(m,n,k)$ is obtained by removing $k$ independent edges from the complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$. In this paper, we prove that for any nearly complete bipartite graph $G(m,n,k)$ with $m, n\geq 3$, and $(m,n,k)\notin\{(5,4,4)$, $(4,5,4)$, $(5,5,5)\}$, there exists a nonorientable genus embedding $\Pi$ satisfying $\tilde{\gamma}(\Pi)=\max\{\lceil \big((m-2)(n-2)-k\big)/2\rceil, 1\}$. This embedding can be constructed by starting from an embedding of some $G(p,q,h)$ with $h\leq 6$ and $p,q\leq 7$, and then iteratively adding multiple copies of $G(2,2,2)$, $G(2,0,0)$ and $G(0,2,0)$. As a consequence, the previously unresolved nonorientable genus $\tilde{\gamma}(G(n+1,n,n))$ for even $n$ and $\tilde{\gamma}(G(n,n,n))$ for arbitrary $n$ are now determined.</description>

Abstract: The modern theory of homogeneous structures begins with the work of Roland Fra\"iss\'e. The theory developed in the last seventy years is placed in the border area between combinatorics, model theory, algebra, and analysis. We turn our attention to its combinatorial pillar, namely, the work on the classification of structures for given homogeneity types, and focus onto the homomorphism homogeneous ones, introduced in 2006 by Cameron and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. An oriented graph is called homomorphism homogeneous if every homomorphism between finite induced subgraphs extends to an endomorphism. In this paper we present a complete classification of the countable homomorphism homogeneous oriented graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Delta,q\geq 3$ be integers. We prove that there exists $\eta\geq 0.002$ such that if $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$, then there exists an open set $\mathcal{U}\subset \mathbb{C}$ that contains the interval $[0,1]$ such that for each $w\in \mathcal{U}$ and any graph $G=(V,E)$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, the partition function of the anti-ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model evaluated at $w$ does not vanish. This provides a (modest) improvement on a result of Liu, Sinclair, and Srivastava, and breaks the $q=2\Delta$-barrier for this problem.
  As a direct consequence we obtain via Barvinok's interpolation method a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to approximate the number of proper $q$-colorings of graphs of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, provided $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Topology of total cut complexes and cut complexes of grid graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Fr{\"o}berg (1990) and Eagon and Reiner (1998), Bayer et al. recently introduced two new graph complexes: total cut complexes and cut complexes. In this article, we investigate these complexes specifically for (rectangular) grid graphs, focusing on $2 \times n$ and $3 \times n$ cases. We extend and refine the work of Bayer et al., proving and strengthening several of their conjectures, thereby enhancing the understanding of these graph complexes' topological and combinatorial properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-subsets of an $n$-set is called $s$-almost $t$-intersecting if each member is $t$-disjoint with at most $s$ members. In this paper, we prove that, if $\left|\mathcal{F}\right|$ is maximum, then $\mathcal{F}$ consists of all $k$-subsets containing a fixed $t$-subset. Consequently, it is natural to consider the maximum-sized $\mathcal{F}$ with $\left|\bigcap_{F\in\mathcal{F}} F\right|&lt;t$. The famous Hilton-Milner theorem settles the case where $\mathcal{F}$ is $t$-intersecting. We characterize the remaining case completely.</description>

      <title>When entropy meets Tur\'an: new proofs and hypergraph Tur\'an results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new proof of a density version of Tur\'an's theorem. We also rephrase both the theorem and the proof using entropy. With the entropic formulation, we show that some naturally defined entropic quantity is closely connected to other common quantities such as Lagrangian and spectral radius. In addition, we also determine the Tur\'an density for a new family of hypergraphs, which we call tents. Our result can be seen as a new generalization of Mubayi's result on the extended cliques.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Combinatorial Stability of Independence Polynomials in Iterated Strong Products of Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the independence polynomials arising from iterated strong products of cycle graphs, examining their algebraic symmetries and combinatorial structures. Leveraging modular arithmetic and Galois theory, we establish precise conditions under which these polynomials factor over finite fields, highlighting modular collapses based on prime and composite cycle lengths. We demonstrate that while real-rootedness depends on cycle parity, the combinatorial structure ensures universal log-concavity and unimodality of coefficients. A toggling argument provides a combinatorial proof of unimodality, complementing algebraic methods and offering insights into polynomial stability. These findings bridge combinatorial and algebraic perspectives, contributing to graph-theoretic frameworks with implications in statistical mechanics and information theory.</description>

      <title>Disproving two conjectures on the Hamiltonicity of Venn diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1984, Winkler conjectured that every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves can be extended to a simple Venn diagram with $n+1$ curves. His conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the dual graph of any simple Venn diagram has a Hamilton cycle. In this work, we construct counterexamples to Winkler's conjecture for all $n\geq 6$. As part of this proof, we computed all 3.430.404 simple Venn diagrams with $n=6$ curves (even their number was not previously known), among which we found 72 counterexamples. We also construct monotone Venn diagrams, i.e., diagrams that can be drawn with $n$ convex curves, and are not extendable, for all $n\geq 7$. Furthermore, we also disprove another conjecture about the Hamiltonicity of the (primal) graph of a Venn diagram. Specifically, while working on Winkler's conjecture, Pruesse and Ruskey proved that this graph has a Hamilton cycle for every simple Venn diagram with $n$ curves, and conjectured that this also holds for non-simple diagrams. We construct counterexamples to this conjecture for all $n\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Covering Complete Geometric Graphs by Monotone Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $A$ of $n$ points (vertices) in general position in the plane, the \emph{complete geometric graph} $K_n[A]$ consists of all $\binom{n}{2}$ segments (edges) between the elements of $A$. It is known that the edge set of every complete geometric graph on $n$ vertices can be partitioned into $O(n^{3/2})$ crossing-free paths (or matchings). We strengthen this result under various additional assumptions on the point set. In particular, we prove that for a set $A$ of $n$ \emph{randomly} selected points, uniformly distributed in $[0,1]^2$, with probability tending to $1$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, the edge set of $K_n[A]$ can be covered by $O(n\log n)$ crossing-free paths and by $O(n\sqrt{\log n})$ crossing-free matchings. On the other hand, we construct $n$-element point sets such that covering the edge set of $K_n[A]$ requires a quadratic number of monotone paths.</description>

      <title>A result on spanning trees with bounded total excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and $T$ a spanning tree of $G$. Let $\rho(G)$ denote the adjacency spectral radius of $G$. The $k$-excess of a vertex $v$ in $T$ is defined as $\max\{0,d_T(v)-k\}$. The total $k$-excess $\mbox{te}(T,k)$ is defined by $\mbox{te}(T,k)=\sum\limits_{v\in V(T)}{\max\{0,d_T(v)-k\}}$. A tree $T$ is said to be a $k$-tree if $d_T(v)\leq k$ for any $v\in V(T)$, that is to say, the maximum degree of a $k$-tree is at most $k$. In fact, $T$ is a spanning $k$-tree if and only if $\mbox{te}(T,k)=0$. This paper studies a generalization of spanning $k$-trees using a concept called total $k$-excess and proposes a lower bound for $\rho(G)$ in a connected graph $G$ to ensure that $G$ contains a spanning tree $T$ with $\mbox{te}(T,k)\leq b$, where $k$ and $b$ are two nonnegative integers with $k\geq\max\{5,b+3\}$ and $(b,k)\neq(2,5)$.</description>

      <title>Extendability of $1$-decomposable complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Simon (1994) states that any pure $d$-dimensional shellable complex on $n$ vertices can be extended to $\Delta_{n-1}^{(d)}$, the $d$-skeleton of the $(n-1)$-dimensional simplex, by attaching one facet at a time while maintaining shellability.
  The notion of $k$-decomposability for simplicial complexes, which generalizes shellability, was introduced by Provan and Billera (1980). Coleman, Dochtermann, Geist, and Oh (2022) showed that any pure $d$-dimensional $0$-decomposable complex on $n$ vertices can similarly be extended to $\Delta_{n-1}^{(d)}$, attaching one facet at a time while preserving $0$-decomposability.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous question for $1$-decomposable complexes. We prove a slightly relaxed version: any pure $d$-dimensional $1$-decomposable complex on $n$ vertices can be extended to $\Delta_{n + d - 3}^{(d)}$, attaching one facet at a time while maintaining $1$-decomposability.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Shannon Capacity of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact values and new bounds for the Shannon capacity of two families of graphs: the $q$-Kneser graphs and the tadpole graphs. We also construct a countably infinite family of connected graphs whose Shannon capacity is not attained by the independence number of any finite strong power. Building on recent work of Schrijver, we establish sufficient conditions under which the Shannon capacity of a polynomial in graphs, formed via disjoint unions and strong products, equals the corresponding polynomial of the individual capacities, thereby reducing the evaluation of such capacities to that of their components. Finally, we prove an inequality relating the Shannon capacities of the strong product of graphs and their disjoint union, which yields streamlined proofs of several known bounds. In addition to contributing to the computation of the Shannon capacity of graphs, this paper is intended to serve as an accessible entry point to those wishing to work in this area.</description>

      <title>The product measures of cross $t$-intersecting families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the product measures of intersection problems in extremal combinatorics. Invoking a recent result of He--Li--Wu--Zhang, we prove that for any $ n \geq t \geq 3$ and $ p_1, p_2 \in (0, \frac{1}{t+1})$, if $ \mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ are cross $ t$-intersecting families, then $\mu_{p_1}(\mathcal{F}_1)\mu_{p_2}(\mathcal{F}_2)\le (p_1p_2)^t$. Secondly, we study the intersection problems for integer sequences by proving that if $\mathcal{H}_1, \mathcal{H}_2 \subseteq [m]^{n}$ are cross $t$-intersecting with $ m &gt; t+1$, then $|\mathcal{H}_1|| \mathcal{H}_2|\leq (m^{n-t})^2$. These results confirm two classical conjectures of Tokushige. As an application, we strengthen a recent theorem of Frankl--Kupavskii, generalizing the well-known IU-Theorem. Finally, we show that if $ p \geq \frac{1}{2}$ and $ \mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ are cross $t$-intersecting families, then $\min \left\{\mu_{p}(\mathcal{F}_1),\mu_{p}(\mathcal{F}_2)\right\} \leq \mu_{p}(\mathcal{K}(n,t))$, where $\mathcal{K}(n,t)$ denotes the Katona family. This recovers an old result of Ahlswede--Katona.</description>

This theorem determines limits of probabilities that walks in the grid graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$ starting at the origin visit the given vertex. We generalize it to the countable complete graph $K_{\mathbb{N}}$ with edge weights in $\mathbb{C}$.

      <title>Signed Mahonian Polynomials on Colored Derangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polynomial $\sum_{\pi \in W}q^{maj(\pi)}$ of major index over a classical Weyl group $W$ with a generating set $S$ is called the Mahonian polynomial over $W$, and also the polynomial $\sum_{\pi \in W}(-1)^{l(\pi)}q^{maj(\pi)}$ of major index together with sign over the group $W$ is called the signed Mahonian polynomial over the group $W$, where $l$ is the length function on $W$ defined in terms of the generating set $S$. We concern with the signed Mahonian polynomial $$\sum_{\pi \in D_{n}^{(c)}}(-1)^{L(\pi)}q^{fmaj(\pi)}$$ on the set $D_{n}^{(c)}$ of colored derangements in the group $G_{c,n}$ of colored permutations, where $L$ denotes the length function defined by means of a complex root system described by Bremke and Malle in $G_{c,n}$ and $fmaj$ defined by Adin and Roichman in $G_{c,n}$ represents the \textit{flag-major index}, which is a Mahonian statistic. As an application of the formula for signed Mahonian polynomials on the set of colored derangements, we will derive a formula to count colored derangements of even length in $G_{c,n}$ when $c$ is an even number. Finally, we conclude by providing a formula for the difference between the number of derangements of even and odd lengths in $G_{c,n}$ for every positive integer $c$, regardless of whether c is odd or even.</description>

      <title>Indecomposability and beyond via the graph of edge dependencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A polytope is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed (non-trivially) as a Minkowski sum of other polytopes. Since the concept was introduced by Gale in 1954, several increasingly strong criteria have been developed to characterize indecomposability. In this paper, we introduce a new indecomposability criterion that unifies and generalizes most existing approaches. The key new ingredient is the graph of (implicit) edge dependencies, which records proportionalities between edge lengths across deformations and has broader applications in the study of deformation cones of polytopes, beyond indecomposability.
  As a main application, we construct new indecomposable deformed permutahedra that are not matroid polytopes. In 1970, Edmonds posed the problem of characterizing the extreme rays of the submodular cone, equivalently, indecomposable deformed permutahedra. Matroid polytopes from connected matroids form a well-known family of such examples. We exhibit a new infinite family of indecomposable deformations of the permutahedron, disjoint from matroid polytopes, obtained by suitable truncations of vertices of certain graphical zonotopes.
  We further demonstrate the scope of our methods through several additional applications. In particular, we refute a conjecture by Smilansky (1987) asserting that indecomposable polytopes must have relatively few vertices compared to their number of facets. We also obtain new bounds on the dimensions of deformation cones and characterize certain of their extreme rays, introduce parallelogramic Minkowski sums whose deformation cones factor as products, and provide new constructions of indecomposable polytopes via truncations and stackings.</description>

      <title>A poset representation for stable contracts in a two-sided market generated by integer choice functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing a variety of earlier problems on stable contracts in two-sided markets, Alkan and Gale introduced in 2003 a general stability model on a bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ in which the vertices are interpreted as ``agents'', and the edges as possible ``contract'' between pairs of ``agents''. The edges are endowed with nonnegative capacities $b$ giving upper bounds on ``contract intensities'', and the preferencies of each ``agent'' $v\in V$ depend on a \emph{choice function} (CFs) that acts on the set of ``contracts'' involving $v$, obeying three well motivated axioms of \it{consistence}, \it{substitutability} and \it{cardinal monotonicity}. In their model, the capacities and choice functions can take reals or discrete values and, extending well-known earlier results on particular cases, they proved that systems of \it{stable} contracts always exist and, moreover, their set $\cal S$ constitutes a distributive lattice under a natural comparison relation $\prec$.
  In this paper, we study Alkan--Gale's model when all capacities and choice functions take integer values. We characterize the set of rotations -- augmenting cycles linking neighboring stable assignments in the lattice $(\cal S,\prec)$, explain how to construct the rotations efficiently, and devise a weighted poset in which the lattice of closed functions is isomorphic to $(\cal S,\prec)$, thus obtaining an explicit representation for the latter. We show that in general the size of the poset is at most $b^{\rm max}|E|$, where $b^{\rm max}$ is the maximal capacity, and the poset can be constructed in pseudo polynomial time. Then we explain that by imposing an additional condition on CFs, the size of the poset becomes polynomial in $|V|$, and the total time reduces to a polynomial in $|V|,\log b^{\rm max}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory of matchings for finite subsets of an abelian group, introduced in connection with a conjecture of Wakeford on canonical forms for symmetric tensors, has since been extended to the setting of field extensions and to that of matroids. Earlier approaches have produced numerous criteria for matchability and unmatchability, but have offered little structural insight. In this paper, we develop parallel structure theorems which characterize unmatchable pairs in both abelian groups and field extensions. Our framework reveals analogous obstructions to matchability: nearly periodic decompositions of sets in the group setting correspond to decompositions of subspaces involving translates of a subfield in the linear setting. This perspective not only recovers previously known results through short proofs, but also leads to new matching criteria and guarantees the existence of nontrivial unmatchable pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies increasing trees on $n$ labeled vertices, in which labels increase from the root to the leaves. It is known that the number of binary increasing trees coincides with the number of alternating permutations (Euler numbers). Riordan obtained explicit formulas for the numbers of ternary and quaternary trees. This article derives a general formula for the number of $m\text{-ary}$ increasing trees for any $m$. The main result is expressed in terms of the degree-chromatic polynomial of the complete graph and Bell polynomials. It is shown how the corresponding generating function is related to the inversion problem and how combinatorial methods, including the lemma on coefficients of the multiplicative inverse function and the Lagrange inversion formula, can be used to compute the coefficients. A connection is also established between the values of the degree-chromatic polynomial at $\lambda=-1$ and the numbers of special permutations studied by Gessel.</description>

      <title>Multiple polylogarithms at non-positive indices and combinatorics of Magnus polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate multiple polylogarithms with non-positive multi-indices (nonpositive MPLs) from a combinatorial and algebraic viewpoint. By introducing a correspondence between non-positive multiple polylogarithms and Magnus polynomials in a free associative algebra, we obtain an explicit Magnus-type representation of products of mono-indexed non-positive MPLs. The main identity (Theorem A) expresses such a product as a single non-positive MPL indexed by a Magnus polynomial, which may be regarded as a M\"obius inversion of the expansion formula due to Duchamp-Hoang Ngoc Minh-Ngo. Moreover, we study the effects of permuted indices and show that certain differences of Magnus polynomials belong to the kernel of the linear map ${\rm Li}^-_{\bullet}$ , leading to new functional equations among non-positive MPLs of the same weight and depth. These results clarify the combinatorial structure underlying non-positive MPLs and reveal a close connection with the Magnus expansion in non-commutative algebra.</description>

      <title>$SL_2$-tilings with translational symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $SL_2$-tiling is a bi-infinite matrix in which all adjacent $2 \times 2$ minors are equal to $1$. Positive integral $SL_2$-tilings were introduced by Assem, Reutenauer and Smith as generalisations of classical Conway--Coxeter frieze patterns. We show that positive integral $SL_2$-tilings with translational symmetry are in bijection with triangulations of annuli. We use this correspondence to study the properties of periodic positive integral $SL_2$-tilings.</description>

      <title>Fixed-strength spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spherical $t$-design is a finite subset $X$ of the unit sphere such that every polynomial of degree at most $t$ has the same average over $X$ as it does over the entire sphere. Determining the minimum possible size of spherical designs, especially in a fixed dimension as $t \to \infty$, has been an important research topic for several decades. This paper presents results on the complementary asymptotic regime, where $t$ is fixed and the dimension tends to infinity. The main results in this paper are (1) a construction of smaller spherical designs via an explicit connection to Gaussian designs and (2) the exact order of magnitude of minimal-size signed $t$-designs, which is significantly smaller than predicted by a typical degrees-of-freedom heuristic. We also establish a method to ``project'' spherical designs between dimensions, prove a variety of results on approximate designs, and construct new $t$-wise independent subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,q\}^d$ which may be of independent interest. To achieve these results, we combine techniques from algebra, geometry, probability, representation theory, and optimization.</description>

      <title>A quantum N-dimer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum version of the $n$-dimer model from statistical mechanics, based on the formalism from quantum topology developed by Reshetikhin and Turaev (the latter which, in particular, can be used to construct the Jones polynomial of a knot in $\mathbb{R}^3$). We apply this machinery to construct an isotopy invariant polynomial for knotted bipartite ribbon graphs in $\mathbb{R}^3$, giving, in the planar setting, a quantum $n$-dimer partition function. As one application, we compute the expected number of loops in the (classical) double dimer model for planar bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Modular Periodicity of Random Initialized Recurrences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo $m$ (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all $m^2$ possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect mirror symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = - a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli based on their quadratic reciprocity and demonstrate that periodic sequences exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we propose explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings imply potential connections to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and L-functions.</description>

      <title>Generalized binomial edge ideals are Cartwright-Sturmfels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binomial edge ideals associated to a simple graph G were introduced by Herzog and collaborators and, independently, by Ohtani. They became an ``instant classic" in combinatorial commutative algebra with more than 100 papers devoted to their investigation over the past 15 years. They exhibit many striking properties, including being radical and, moreover, Cartwright-Sturmfels. Using the fact that binomial edge ideals can be seen as ideals of 2-minors of a matrix of variables with two rows, generalized binomial edge ideals of 2-minors of matrices of m rows were introduced by Rauh and proved to be radical. The goal of this paper is to prove that generalized binomial edge ideals are Cartwright-Sturmfels. On the way we provide results on ideal constructions preserving the Cartwright-Sturmfels property. We also give examples and counterexamples to the Cartwright-Sturmfels property for higher minors.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal moments in free and c-free probability and Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinitesimal moments associated with infinitesimal freeness and infinitesimal conditional freeness are studied. For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.</description>
