      <title>Creating a dynamic database of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A database of abstract groups has been added to the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), available at https://www.lmfdb.org/Groups/Abstract/. We discuss the functionality of the database and what makes it distinct from other available databases of abstract groups. We describe solutions to mathematical problems we encountered while creating the database, as well as connections between the abstract groups database and other collections of objects in the LMFDB.</description>

Abstract: In this paper it is proved that the group $F\left(\frac32\right)$, a Thompson-style group with breaks in $\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac16\right]$ but whose slopes are restricted only to powers of $\frac32$, is finitely generated, with a generating set of two elements.</description>

      <title>Geometry and dynamics of the extension graph of graph product of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the extension graph of graph product of groups and study its geometry. This enables us to study properties of graph products of groups by exploiting large scale geometry of its defining graph. In particular, we show that the extension graph exhibits the same phenomenon about asymptotic dimension as quasi-trees of metric spaces studied by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara. Moreover, we present three applications of the extension graph of graph product when a defining graph is hyperbolic. First, we provide a new class of convergence groups by considering the action of graph product of finite groups on a compactification of the extension graph and identify the if and only if condition for this action to be geometrically finite. Secondly, we prove relative hyperbolicity of the semi-direct product of groups that interpolates between wreath product and free product. Finally, we provide a new class of graph product of finite groups whose group von Neumnann algebra is strongly solid.</description>

      <title>Howson groups which are not strongly Howson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ is called a Howson group if the intersection $H\cap K$ of any two finitely generated subgroups $H, K&lt;G$ is again finitely generated, and called a strongly Howson group when a uniform bound for the rank of $H\cap K$ can be obtained from the ranks of $H$ and $K$. Clearly, every strongly Howson group is a Howson group, but it is unclear in the literature whether the converse is true. In this note, we show that the converse is not true by constructing the first Howson groups which are not strongly Howson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove for $m\geq1$ and $n\geq5$ that the level $m$ congruence subgroup $B_n[m]$ of the braid group $B_n$ associated to the integral Burau representation $B_n\to\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by $m$th powers of half-twists and the braid Torelli group. This solves a problem of Margalit, generalizing work of Assion, Brendle--Margalit, Nakamura, Stylianakis and Wajnryb.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Burnside laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct novel examples of finitely generated groups that exhibit seemingly-contradicting probabilistic behaviors with respect to Burnside laws. We construct a finitely generated group that satisfies a Burnside law, namely a law of the form $x^n=1$, with limit probability 1 with respect to uniform measures on balls in its Cayley graph and under every lazy non-degenerate random walk, while containing a free subgroup. We show that the limit probability of satisfying a Burnside law is highly sensitive to the choice of generating set, by providing a group for which this probability is $0$ for one generating set and $1$ for another. Furthermore, we construct groups that satisfy Burnside laws of two co-prime exponents with probability 1. Finally, we present a finitely generated group for which every real number in the interval $[0,1]$ appears as a partial limit of the probability sequence of Burnside law satisfaction, both for uniform measures on Cayley balls and for random walks.
  Our results resolve several open questions posed by Amir, Blachar, Gerasimova, and Kozma. The techniques employed in this work draw upon geometric analysis of relations in groups, information-theoretic coding theory on groups, and combinatorial and probabilistic methods.</description>

      <title>Realizability of fusion systems by discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime $p$, fusion systems over discrete $p$-toral groups are categories that model and generalize the $p$-local structure of Lie groups and certain other infinite groups in the same way that fusion systems over finite $p$-groups model and generalize the $p$-local structure of finite groups. In the finite case, it is natural to say that a fusion system $\mathcal{F}$ is realizable if it is isomorphic to the fusion system of a finite group, but it is less clear what realizability should mean in the discrete $p$-toral case.
  In this paper, we look at some of the different types of realizability for fusion systems over discrete $p$-toral groups, including realizability by linear torsion groups and sequential realizability, of which the latter is the most general. After showing that fusion systems of compact Lie groups are always realized by linear torsion groups (hence sequentially realizable), we give some new tools for showing that certain fusion systems are not sequentially realizable, and illustrate it with two large families of examples.</description>

      <title>Rational cohomology and Zariski dense subgroups of solvable linear algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish results concerning the cohomology of Zariski dense subgroups of solvable linear algebraic groups. We show that for an irreducible solvable $\mathbb{Q}$-defined linear algebraic group $\mathbf{G}$, there exists an isomorphism between the cohomology rings with coefficients in a finite dimensional rational $\mathbf{G}$-module $M$ of the associated $\mathbb{Q}$-defined Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g_\mathbb{Q}}$ and Zariski dense subgroups $\Gamma \leq \mathbf{G}(\mathbb{Q})$ that satisfy the condition that they intersect the $\mathbb{Q}$-split maximal torus discretely. We further prove that the restriction map in rational cohomology from $\mathbf{G}$ to a Zariski dense subgroup $\Gamma \leq \mathbf{G}(\mathbb{Q})$ with coefficients in $M$ is an injection. We then derive several results regarding finitely generated solvable groups of finite abelian rank and their representations on cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the growth tightness of the quotient by confined subgroups in groups admitting the statistically convex-cocompact action with contracting elements. The result is sharp in the sense that the actions could not be relaxed with purely exponential growth. Applications to uniformly recurrent subgroups are discussed.</description>

      <title>Linearity, crystallographic quotients, and automorphisms of virtual Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Artin groups were recently introduced by Bellingeri, Paris, and Thiel as broad generalizations of the well-known virtual braid groups. For each Coxeter graph $\Gamma$, they defined the virtual Artin group $VA[\Gamma]$, which is generated by the corresponding Artin group $A[\Gamma]$ and the Coxeter group $W[\Gamma]$, subject to certain mixed relations inspired by the action of $W[\Gamma]$ on its root system $\Phi[\Gamma]$. There is a natural surjection $ \mathrm{VA}[\Gamma] \rightarrow W[\Gamma]$, with the kernel $PVA[\Gamma]$ representing the pure virtual Artin group. In this paper, we explore linearity, crystallographic quotients, and automorphisms of certain classes of virtual Artin groups. Inspired from the work of Cohen, Wales, and Krammer, we construct a linear representation of the virtual Artin group $VA[\Gamma]$. As a consequence of this representation, we deduce that if $W[\Gamma]$ is a spherical Coxeter group, then $VA[\Gamma]/PVA[\Gamma]'$ is a crystallographic group of dimension $ |\Phi[\Gamma]|$ with the holonomy group $W[\Gamma]$. Further, extending an idea of Davis and Januszkiewicz, we prove that all right-angled virtual Artin groups admit a faithful linear representation. The remainder of the paper focuses on conjugacy classes and automorphisms of a subclass of right-angled virtual Artin groups, $VAT_n$, associated with planar braid groups called twin groups. We determine the automorphism group of $VAT_n$ for each $n\geq 5$, and give a precise description of a generic automorphism. As an application of this description, we prove that $VAT_n$ has the $R_\infty$-property for each $n \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>On the number of exact factorization of finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the function $f_2(G)$ that counts the number of exact factorizations of a finite group $G$. We compute $f_2(G)$ for some well-known families of finite groups and use the results of Wiegold and Williamson \cite{WW} to derive an asymptotic expression for the number of exact factorizations of the alternating group $A_{2^n}$. Finally, we propose several questions about the function $f_2(G)$ that may be of interest for further research.</description>

      <title>Permutation groups, partition lattices and block structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on $\Omega$. The $G$-invariant partitions form a sublattice of the lattice of all partitions of $\Omega$, having the further property that all its elements are uniform (that is, have all parts of the same size). If, in addition, all the equivalence relations defining the partitions commute, then the relations form an \emph{orthogonal block structure}, a concept from statistics; in this case the lattice is modular. If it is distributive, then we have a \emph{poset block structure}, whose automorphism group is a \emph{generalised wreath product}. We examine permutation groups with these properties, which we call the \emph{OB property} and \emph{PB property} respectively, and in particular investigate when direct and wreath products of groups with these properties also have these properties.
  A famous theorem on permutation groups asserts that a transitive imprimitive group $G$ is embeddable in the wreath product of two factors obtained from the group (the group induced on a block by its setwise stabiliser, and the group induced on the set of blocks by~$G$). We extend this theorem to groups with the PB property, embeddng them into generalised wreath products. We show that the map from posets to generalised wreath products preserves intersections and inclusions.
  We have included background and historical material on these concepts.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any countable acylidrically hyperbolic group $G$, there exists a generating set $S$ of $G$ such that the corresponding Cayley graph $\Gamma(G,S)$ is hyperbolic, $|\partial\Gamma(G,X)|&gt;2$, the natural action of $G$ on $\Gamma(G,S)$ is acylindrical, and the natural action of $G$ on the Gromov boundary $\partial\Gamma(G,S)$ is hyperfinite. This result broadens a class of groups that admit a non-elementary acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space with hyperfinite boundary action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let F_2 denote the free group of rank 2. Our main technical result of independent interest is: for any element u of F_2, there is g in F_2 such that no cyclically reduced image of u under an automorphism of F_2 contains g as a subword. We then address computational complexity of the following version of the Whitehead automorphism problem: given a fixed u in F_2, decide, on an input v in F_2 of length n, whether or not v is an automorphic image of u. We show that there is an algorithm that solves this problem and has constant (i.e., independent of n) average-case complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of $S$-characters of finite groups was introduced by Zhmud as a generalisation of transitive permutation characters. Any non-trivial $S$-character takes a zero value on some group element. By a deep result depending on the classification of finite simple groups a non-trivial transitive permutation character even vanishes on some element of prime power order. We present an example that this does not generalise to $S$-characters, thereby answering a question posed by J.-P. Serre.</description>

      <title>Parameterizing Conjugacy Classes of Unramified Tori via Bruhat-Tits Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose $k$ is a nonarchimedean local field, $K$ is a maximally unramified extension of $k$, and $\mathbf{G}$ is a connected reductive $k$-group. In this paper we provide parameterizations via Bruhat-Tits theory of: the rational conjugacy classes of $k$-tori in $\mathbf{G}$ that split over $K$; the rational and stable conjugacy classes of the $K$-split components of the centers of unramified twisted Levi subgroups of $\mathbf{G}$; and the rational conjugacy classes of unramified twisted generalized Levi subgroups of $\mathbf{G}$. We also provide parameterizations of analogous objects for finite groups of Lie type.</description>

      <title>On quasi-arithmeticity of hyperbolic hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a more general version of the hybrid construction of Gromov and Piatetski--Shapiro, where the building blocks are no longer assumed to be arithmetic. We show that if such a general hyberbolic hybrid of dimension $\geqslant 3$ is quasi-arithmetic (a notion which is a broader notion than that of arithmeticity) then each building block must be quasi-arithmetic as well and, moreover, must with the same ambient group and adjoint trace field. On the other hand, we provide an example of a nonarithmetic but quasi-arithmetic orbifold such that a specific gluing of this orbifold with itself along the boundary gives rise to an arithmetic hyperbolic orbifold. We also note that if the building blocks are incommensurable, then the hybrid is not arithmetic. Together with the above, this implies that if a hyperbolic hybrid is arithmetic, then it is glued from commensurable quasi-arithmetic blocks.
  We illustrate the above results in the setting of reflection groups and hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra and apply them to rule out the (quasi-)arithmeticity of a family of ideal hyperbolic right-angled $3$-polyhedra, namely, certain ``twisted'' ideal right-angled antiprisms.</description>

      <title>Totally Ramified Maximal Tori and Bruhat-Tits theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose $k$ is a nonarchimedean local field, $K$ is a maximally unramified extension of $k$, and $\mathbf{G}$ is a connected reductive $k$-group. If $\mathbf{T}$ is a $K$-minisotropic maximal $k$-torus in $\mathbf{G}$, then we use Bruhat-Tits theory to describe the stable classes in the $\mathbf{G}$-orbit of $\mathbf{T}$, the rational classes in the $\mathbf{G}$-orbit of $\mathbf{T}$, and the $k$-embeddings, up to rational conjugacy, into $\mathbf{G}$ of $\mathbf{T}$. We also provide, via Bruhat-Tits theory, a complete and explicit description of: the rational conjugacy classes of $K$-minisotropic maximal tame $k$-tori in $\mathbf{G}$; the stable classes of $K$-minisotropic maximal tame $k$-tori in $\mathbf{G}$; and the $k$-embeddings, up to rational conjugacy, into $\mathbf{G}$ of a $K$-minisotropic maximal tame $k$-torus of $\mathbf{G}$.</description>

      <title>On Character Variety of Anosov Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the free group $F_k$ of $k$ generators, $k \geq 2$, resp. the fundamental group $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ of a closed, connnected, orientatble surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We show that the charater variety of irreducible, resp. Zariski dense, Anosov representations of $\Gamma$ into $\SL(n, \C)$ is a complex manifold of (complex) dimension $(k-1)(n^2-1)$, resp. $(2g-2) (n^2-1)$. For $\Gamma=\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we also show that these character varieties are holomorphic symplectic manifolds.</description>
