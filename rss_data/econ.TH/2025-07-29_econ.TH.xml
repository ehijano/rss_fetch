      <title>A Simulation-Based Conceptual Model for Tokenized Recycling: Integrating Blockchain, Market Dynamics, and Behavioral Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a conceptual simulation model for a tokenized recycling incentive system that integrates blockchain infrastructure, market-driven pricing, behavioral economics, and carbon credit mechanisms. The model aims to address the limitations of traditional recycling systems, which often rely on static government subsidies and fail to generate sustained public participation. By introducing dynamic token values linked to real-world supply and demand conditions, as well as incorporating non-monetary behavioral drivers (e.g., social norms, reputational incentives), the framework creates a dual-incentive structure that can adapt over time. The model uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate outcomes under a range of scenarios involving operational costs, carbon pricing, token volatility, and behavioral adoption rates. Due to the absence of real-world implementations of such integrated blockchain-based recycling systems, the paper remains theoretical and simulation-based. It is intended as a prototype framework for future policy experimentation and pilot projects. The model provides insights for policymakers, urban planners, and technology developers aiming to explore decentralized and market-responsive solutions to sustainable waste management. Future work should focus on validating the model through field trials or behavioral experiments.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Estimating Preferences Using Response Time Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general methodology for recovering preference parameters from data on choices and response times. Our methods yield estimates with fast ($1/n$ for $n$ data points) convergence rates when specialized to the popular Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), but are broadly applicable to generalizations of the DDM as well as to alternative models of decision making that make use of response time data. The paper develops an empirical application to an experiment on intertemporal choice, showing that the use of response times delivers predictive accuracy and matters for the estimation of economically relevant parameters.</description>

      <title>Strict Comparisons of Infinite Utility Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists a preference relation on infinite utility streams that does not discriminate between different periods, satisfies the Pareto criterion, and so that almost all pairs of utility streams are strictly comparable. Such a preference relation provides a counterexample to a claim in [Zame, William R. ``Can intergenerational equity be operationalized?'' Theoretical Economics 2.2 (2007): 187-202.]</description>

      <title>Greening Schoolyards and Urban Property Values: A Systematic Review of Geospatial and Statistical Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1.1 Background Parks and the greening of schoolyards are examples of urban green spaces that have been praised for their environmental, social, and economic benefits in cities all over the world. More studies show that living near green spaces is good for property values. However, there is still disagreement about how strong and consistent these effects are in different cities (Browning et al., 2023; Grunewald et al., 2024; Teo et al., 2023). 1.2 Purpose This systematic review is the first to bring together a lot of geographical and statistical information that links greening schoolyards to higher property prices, as opposed to just green space in general. By focusing on schoolyard-specific interventions, we find complex spatial, economic, and social effects that are often missed in larger studies of green space. 1.3 Methods This review followed the PRISMA guidelines and did a systematic search and review of papers that were published in well-known journals for urban studies, the environment, and real estate. The criteria for inclusion stressed the use of hedonic pricing or spatial econometric models to look at the relationship between urban green space and home values in a quantitative way. Fifteen studies from North America, Europe, and Asia met the requirements for inclusion (Anthamatten et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Mansur &amp; Yusuf, 2022).</description>

      <title>Sequential Cursed Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06025v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extensive-form solution concept, with players that neglect information from hypothetical events, but make inferences from observed events. Our concept modifies cursed equilibrium (Eyster and Rabin, 2005), and allows that players can be 'cursed about' endogenous information.</description>

      <title>Hoping for the best while preparing for the worst in the face of uncertainty: a new type of incomplete preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and axiomatize a new model of incomplete preferences under uncertainty, which we call \textit{hope-and-prepare preferences}. An act is considered more desirable than an other act when, and only when, both an optimistic evaluation, computed as the welfare level attained in a best-case scenario, and a pessimistic one, computed as the welfare level attained in a worst-case scenario, rank the former above the latter. Our comparison criterion involves multiple priors, as best and worst cases are determined among sets of probability distributions. We make the case that, compared to existing incomplete criteria under ambiguity, hope-and-prepare preferences address the trade-off between conviction and decisiveness in a new way, which is more favorable to decisiveness. We also characterize a completion of an incomplete hope-and-prepare preference relation admitting an (asymmetric) $\alpha$-\textit{maxmin expected utility} representation, in which $\alpha$ is unique.</description>

      <title>Separable choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel choice dataset, called joint choice, in which options and menus are multidimensional. In this general setting, we define a notion of choice separability, which requires that selections from some dimensions are never affected by those performed on the remaining dimensions. This yields an extension of the classical definition of separability for discrete preference relations and utility functions beyond rationality requirements. We thoroughly investigate the stability of separability across dimensions, and then suggest effective tests to check whether a joint choice is separable. Upon defining rationalizable joint choices as those explained by the maximization of a relation of revealed preference, we examine the interplay between the notions of rationalizability and separability. Finally, we show that the rationalizability of a separable joint choice can be tested by verifying the rationalizability of some derived joint choices over fewer dimensions.</description>
