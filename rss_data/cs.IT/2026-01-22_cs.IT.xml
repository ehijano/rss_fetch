      <title>Optimality of Staircase Mechanisms for Vector Queries under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal design of additive mechanisms for vector-valued queries under $\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP). Given only the sensitivity of a query and a norm-monotone cost function measuring utility loss, we ask which noise distribution minimizes expected cost among all additive $\epsilon$-DP mechanisms. Using convex rearrangement theory, we show that this infinite-dimensional optimization problem admits a reduction to a one-dimensional compact and convex family of radially symmetric distributions whose extreme points are the staircase distributions. As a consequence, we prove that for any dimension, any norm, and any norm-monotone cost function, there exists an $\epsilon$-DP staircase mechanism that is optimal among all additive mechanisms. This result resolves a conjecture of Geng, Kairouz, Oh, and Viswanath, and provides a geometric explanation for the emergence of staircase mechanisms as extremal solutions in differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Direct and Converse Theorems in Estimating Signals with Sublinear Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of signals with sublinear sparsity sent over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. This fundamental problem arises in designing denoisers used in message-passing algorithms for sublinear sparsity. The main results are direct and converse theorems in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity grows sublinearly in the signal dimension as the signal dimension tends to infinity. As a direct theorem, the maximum likelihood estimator is proved to achieve vanishing square error in the sublinear sparsity limit if the noise variance is smaller than a threshold. As a converse theorem, all estimators cannot achieve square errors smaller than the signal power under a mild condition if the noise variance is larger than another threshold. In particular, the two thresholds coincide with each other when non-zero signals have constant amplitude. These results imply the asymptotic optimality of an existing separable Bayesian estimator used in approximate message-passing for sublinear sparsity.</description>

      <title>Break-Resilient Codes with Loss Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging applications in manufacturing, wireless communication, and molecular data storage require robust coding schemes that remain effective under physical distortions where codewords may be arbitrarily fragmented and partially missing. To address such challenges, we propose a new family of error-correcting codes, termed $(t,s)$-break-resilient codes ($(t,s)$-BRCs). A $(t,s)$-BRC guarantees correct decoding of the original message even after up to~$t$ arbitrary breaks of the codeword and the complete loss of some fragments whose total length is at most~$s$. This model unifies and generalizes previous approaches, extending break-resilient codes (which handle arbitrary fragmentation without fragment loss) and deletion codes (which correct bit losses in unknown positions without fragmentation) into a single information-theoretic framework. We develop a theoretical foundation for $(t,s)$-BRCs, including a formal adversarial channel model, lower bounds on the necessary redundancy, and explicit code constructions that approach these bounds.</description>

      <title>Secure Communication in MIMOME Movable-Antenna Systems with Statistical Eavesdropper CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of movable antennas (MAs) to enhance physical layer security within a multiple-input multiple-output multiple-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) system. We consider a practical scenario where the transmitter operates with imperfect eavesdropper channel state information (ECSI), knowing only the instantaneous line-of-sight (LoS) component and the statistical properties of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) component. To rigorously quantify secrecy performance under the ECSI uncertainty, we adopt the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) as the metric. Since deriving an exact analytical expression for the ESR is intractable, we leverage random matrix theory to derive a deterministic equivalent. This avoids heavy Monte Carlo simulations and also provides explicit insights into the effects of channel spatial statistics on secrecy performance. Building upon the deterministic equivalent, we formulate a joint maximization problem for the transmit precoding matrix and the antenna positions at the legitimate transmitter. To tackle the non-convexity of this optimization problem, we develop a comprehensive alternating optimization framework. Specifically, the precoding matrix is optimized via a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, where the gradient is computed by solving an implicit fixed-point equation. For the antenna position optimization, the complexity of the objective function prevents the construction of standard MM surrogate. To this end, we further propose a novel AMSGrad-based surrogate function that relies solely on gradient information. We provide a rigorous theoretical proof that guarantees the convergence of this proposed algorithm despite relaxing the strict majorization conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Beamforming for Discrete SIM-Aided Multiuser Systems Under Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) have emerged as a revolutionary architecture for next-generation wireless communications, offering wave-domain signal processing capabilities with significantly reduced hardware complexity compared to conventional systems. However, most existing SIM research assumes continuous phase shifts and perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which are impractical due to hardware discrete phase shift constraints and prohibitive pilot overhead. This paper presents a joint power allocation and discrete phase shift optimization framework for SIM-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output(MISO) downlink systems under statistical CSI. We formulate the achievable sum rate maximization problem considering practical discrete phase constraints and derive a closed-form expression for the average achievable rate under statistical CSI. To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we decouple the problem by using the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm and alternating optimization (AO). Subsequently, we utilize the Lagrangian multiplier method and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to obtain closed-form iterative solutions. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity by a factor of 50 compared to semi-definite relaxation (SDR) methods, , while maintaining over 85% of the continuous phase shift performance with only 1-bit quantization, highlighting its feasibility for low-cost hardware systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies expurgated exponents for joint source-channel coding of discrete memoryless sources and channels under i.i.d. random coding. We show that a two-class partitioning of source sequences, where the codeword distribution depends on the source type, achieves an exponent at least as high as that of optimal single-class coding, in which the codeword distribution is independent of the source message.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a random coding technique for joint source-channel coding of discrete memoryless sources and channels. The approach builds on the random Gilbert-Varshamov code construction of Somekh-Baruch et al. and extends it to the joint source-channel setting. We show that the resulting ensemble attains the maximum of the random-coding and expurgated error exponents.</description>

      <title>Information mechanics: conservation and exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference and learning are commonly cast in terms of optimisation, yet the fundamental constraints governing uncertainty reduction remain unclear. This work presents a first-principles framework inherent to Bayesian updating, termed information mechanics (infomechanics). Any pointwise reduction in posterior surprisal is exactly balanced by information gained from data, independently of algorithms, dynamics, or implementation. Imposing additivity, symmetry, and robustness collapses the freedom of this identity to only two independent conservation relations. One governs the global redistribution of uncertainty and recovers Shannon entropy. The other captures a complementary local geometric component, formalised as Fisher information. Together, these conserved quantities motivate a non-additive state function, the information potential $\Phi$, which isolates structural degrees of freedom beyond entropy while remaining invariant under reparametrisation. $\Phi$ quantifies local sharpness and ruggedness in posterior beliefs and vanishes uniquely for isotropic Gaussian distributions. In a low-temperature regime, $\Phi$ scales logarithmically with the effective number of local optima, linking information geometry to computational complexity. This formalises an information-computation exchange, whereby information acquisition reshapes the inference landscape and reduces computational demands. By separating invariant informational constraints from inference mechanisms, this framework provides a unified, algorithm-independent foundation for inference, learning, and computation across biological and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Standardizing OTFS: A Candidate Waveform for Next-Generation Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standardization of the sixth-generation (6G) has recently commenced to address the rapidly growing demands for enhanced wireless network services. Nevertheless, existing wireless systems, particularly at the physical layer waveform level, remain inadequate for achieving the ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) envisioned for 6G. Specifically, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the widely adopted waveform in fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) networks, suffers from inherent limitations in satisfying these stringent requirements. In practice, OFDM can experience severe inter-carrier interference (ICI), resulting in a pronounced data rate error floor caused by high Doppler shifts. Additionally, the repetitive usage of cyclic prefixes (CPs), intended to combat multipath delays, results in significant spectral inefficiency. These fundamental drawbacks pose critical obstacles to fulfilling 6G performance objectives. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a promising waveform candidate, addressing the aforementioned challenges by exploiting the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Unlike OFDM, OTFS is inherently resilient to channel distortions induced by delay and Doppler effects, while remaining sensitive to time and frequency shifts. Such intrinsic properties are instrumental in enabling OTFS, with joint communication and sensing capabilities, to embrace, rather than combat, dynamic channel conditions. Motivated by these compelling advantages, this article investigates the feasibility and practical implementation of OTFS modulation leveraging the current OFDM-based wireless systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Cross-Domain Channel Estimation Scheme for OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain channel estimation (CDCE) algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, leveraging the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Specifically, the proposed algorithm transforms the time-frequency (TF) domain pilot sequence of OFDM into the DD domain and applies a two-dimensional (2D) twisted-convolution for acquiring a coarse estimation of the underlying channel delay and Doppler. Then, the OFDM channel estimation is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem in the TF domain according to the dictionary derived based on the obtained delay and Doppler estimates. Furthermore, a low-complexity $\ell_1$-regularized least-square estimator is proposed to effectively solve this problem. Moreover, we further develop a performance analysis framework of the proposed scheme based on the ambiguity function (AF) of the adopted pilot sequence. Our numerical results demonstrate noticeable estimation performance improvement compared to conventional OFDM channel estimation methods, particularly in the presence of high channel mobility.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Wireless Imaging with Implicit Neural Representation in RIS-Aided ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless imaging is emerging as a key capability in next-generation integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, supporting diverse context-aware applications. However, conventional imaging approaches, whether based on physical models or data-driven learning, face challenges such as accurate multipath separation and representative dataset acquisition. To address these issues, this study explores the use of implicit neural representation (INR), a paradigm that has achieved notable advancements in computer vision, for wireless imaging in reconfigurable intelligent surface-aided ISAC systems. The neural network of INR is specifically designed with positional encoding and sine activation functions. Leveraging physics-informed loss functions, INR is optimized through deep learning to represent continuous target shapes and scattering profiles, enabling resolution-agnostic imaging with strong generalization capability. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed INR-based method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art techniques and further reveals the focal length characteristics of the imaging system.</description>

      <title>Integrating OTFS in Airplane-Aided Next-Generation Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation networks explore the opportunistic assistance of airliner/high-altitude platforms (HAPs) in delivering high data rates for terrestrial networks to ensure consistent and reliable communication. When an airliner/HAP moves at very high speeds, its mobility has a substantial impact on ensuring seamless connectivity, stable signal strength, and reliable data transmission. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been shown to provide notable improvement in performance when handling Doppler effects during high-mobility situations. This paper presents an OTFS-based airplane-aided next-generation networking system. In the proposed system, the airliner/HAPs are equipped with a planar antenna array that applies null steering beamforming (NSB) at the transmitter for communication with terrestrial users. A comprehensive performance comparison between OTFS and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is performed under varying airliner altitude, velocity, array dimension, and Rician factor conditions. The simulation results show that OTFS consistently outperforms OFDM, achieving a lower bit error rate (BER) and more stable performance across different airliner altitudes, velocities, array dimensions, and propagation environments.</description>

      <title>Channel Knowledge Map-assisted Dual-domain Tracking and Predictive Beamforming for High-Mobility Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22796v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted dual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility wireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain (B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, highlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam tracking in high-mobility communications.</description>

      <title>On the existence of Ulanowicz's optimal structural resilience in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the mathematical existence and asymptotic properties of Ulanowicz's structural resilience in complex systems such as supply chain networks. While ecological evidence suggests that sustainable systems gravitate toward an optimal state at $\alpha = 1/\mathrm{e}$, the universality of this configuration in generalized networks remains theoretically unverified. We prove that while optimal resilience is unattainable in two-node networks due to structural over-determinacy, it exists for any directed graph with $N_\mathcal{V} \geq 3$. By constructing a symmetric network model with three types of link weights $(x, y, z)$ and uniform marginal distributions, we derive the governing equations for the optimal resilience configuration. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that as the network size $N_\mathcal{V}$ increases, the link weights required to maintain optimal resilience exhibit a power-law scaling behavior: the adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-1})$, while the non-adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-2})$, both accompanied by specific logarithmic corrections. This work establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the optimal resilience framework and provides a unified perspective on how entropy-based principles govern the robustness and evolution of large-scale complex networks, which may offer quantitative guidance for designing large-scale networked systems under robustness constraints.</description>

Abstract: We study the effect of the choice of embedding geometry on the entropy of random geometric graph ensembles with soft connection functions. First we show that when the connection range is small, the entropy is dependent only on the dimension of the geometry and not the shape, but for large connection ranges the boundaries of the domain matter. Next, we formulate the problem of estimating entropy as a problem of estimating the average degree of a graph with the binary entropy function as its connection function. We use this formulation to study the effect of boundaries on the entropy, and to estimate the entropy of soft random geometric graphs in complicated geometries where a closed form pair distance density is not available.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Statistical Characterization of Large-Scale Automotive Radar Networks</title>

Abstract: The impact of discrete clutter and co-channel interference on the performance of automotive radar networks has been studied using stochastic geometry, in particular, by leveraging two-dimensional Poisson point processes (PPPs). However, such characterization does not take into account the impact of street geometry and the fact that the location of the automotive radars are restricted to the streets as their domain rather than the entire Euclidean plane. In addition, the structure of the streets may change drastically as a vehicle moves out of a city center towards the outskirts. Consequently, not only the radar performance change but also the radar parameters and protocols must be adapted for optimum performance. In this paper, we propose and characterize line and Cox process-based street and point models to analyze large-scale automotive radar networks. We consider the classical Poisson line process (PLP) and the newly introduced Binomial line process (BLP) model to emulate the streets and the corresponding PPP-based Cox process to emulate the vehicular nodes. In particular, the BLP model effectively considers the spatial variation of street geometry across different parts of the city. We derive the effective interference set experienced by an automotive radar, the statistics of distance to interferers, and characterize the detection probability of the ego radar as a function of street and vehicle density. Finally, leveraging the real-world data on urban streets and vehicle density across different cities of the world, we present how the radar performance varies in different parts of the city as well as across different times of the day. Thus, our study equips network operators and automotive manufacturers with essential system design insights to plan and optimize automotive radar networks.</description>

      <title>Goggin's corrected Kalman Filter: Guarantees and Filtering Regimes</title>

Abstract: In this paper we revisit a non-linear filter for {\em non-Gaussian} noises that was introduced in [1]. Goggin proved that transforming the observations by the score function and then applying the Kalman Filter (KF) to the transformed observations results in an asymptotically optimal filter. In the current paper, we study the convergence rate of Goggin's filter in a pre-limit setting that allows us to study a range of signal-to-noise regimes which includes, as a special case, Goggin's setting. Our guarantees are explicit in the level of observation noise, and unlike most other works in filtering, we do not assume Gaussianity of the noises.
  Our proofs build on combining simple tools from two separate literature streams. One is a general posterior Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for filtering. The other is convergence-rate bounds in the Fisher information central limit theorem.
  Along the way, we also study filtering regimes for linear state-space models, characterizing clearly degenerate regimes -- where trivial filters are nearly optimal -- and a {\em balanced} regime, which is where Goggin's filter has the most value. \footnote{This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

      <title>Which Similarity-Sensitive Entropy (S-entropy)?</title>

Abstract: Shannon entropy is not the only entropy that is relevant to machine-learning datasets, nor possibly even the most important one. Traditional entropies such as Shannon entropy capture information represented by elements' frequencies but not the richer information encoded by their similarities and differences. Capturing the latter requires similarity-sensitive entropy (S-entropy). S-entropy can be measured using either the recently developed Leinster-Cobbold-Reeve framework (LCR) or the newer Vendi score (VS). This raises the practical question of which one to use: LCR or VS. Here we address this question conceptually, analytically, and experimentally, using 53 large and well-known imaging and tabular datasets. We find that LCR and VS values can differ by orders of magnitude and are complementary, except in limiting cases. We show that both LCR and VS results depend on how similarities are scaled, and introduce the notion of ``half-distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and present evidence that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is preferable only when a dataset's elements can be usefully interpreted as linear combinations of a more fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system that the dataset describes has a quantum-mechanical character. In the broader case where one simply wishes to capture the rich information encoded by elements' similarities and differences as well as their frequencies, LCR is favored; nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each other.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Probabilistic Semantic Communication Over Visible Light Networks With Rate Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) is emerging as a key technology for future wireless communication systems due to its unique physical-layer advantages over traditional radio-frequency (RF)-based systems. However, its integration with higher-layer techniques, such as semantic communication, remains underexplored. This paper investigates the energy efficiency maximization problem in a resource-constrained VLC-based probabilistic semantic communication (PSCom) system. In the considered model, light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters perform semantic compression to reduce data size, which incurs additional computation overhead. The compressed semantic information is transmitted to the users for semantic inference using a shared knowledge base that requires periodic updates to ensure synchronization. In the PSCom system, the knowledge base is represented by probabilistic graphs. To enable simultaneous transmission of both knowledge and information data, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed. The optimization problem focuses on maximizing energy efficiency by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming, direct current (DC) bias, common rate allocation, and semantic compression ratio, while accounting for both communication and computation costs. To solve this problem, an alternating optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach method is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Quantum Semantic Communication via Sheaf Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) enables bandwidth-efficient coordination in multi-agent systems by transmitting meaning rather than raw bits. However, when agents employ heterogeneous sensing modalities and AI architectures, perfect bit-level transmission no longer guarantees mutual understanding. Although deep learning methods for semantic compression have advanced, the information-theoretic limits of semantic alignment under heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Notably, semantic ambiguity shares the same mathematical structure as quantum contextuality, as both arise from cohomological obstructions, motivating a quantum formulation of SC. In this paper, an information-theoretic framework for quantum semantic communication is proposed using sheaf cohomology. Multi-agent semantic networks are modeled as quantum sheaves, where agents meaning spaces are Hilbert spaces connected by quantum channels. The first sheaf cohomology group is shown to characterize irreducible semantic ambiguity, representing a fundamental obstruction to alignment that no local processing can resolve. The minimum communication rate required for semantic alignment is proven to scale with the logarithm of the dimension of the cohomological space, establishing a semantic analog of Shannon limits. For entanglement-assisted channels, the achievable capacity is shown to strictly exceed classical bounds, with each shared ebit reducing the required classical communication by one bit, providing a rigorous interpretation of shared context. Additionally, quantum contextuality is shown to reduce cohomological obstructions, and a duality between quantum discord and integrated semantic information is established, linking quantum correlations to irreducible semantic content. This framework provides rigorous foundations for quantum-enhanced semantic communication in autonomous multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Quantum Contraction and Correlation Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical information theory, the maximal correlation and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficient establish limits on distributed and sequential processing. Two distinct quantum maximal correlation coefficients have been proposed, but they do not extend all the classical results. Building on work of Petz, we use the family of non-commutative $L^{2}(p)$ spaces that extend the data processing inequality for variance to quantum theory to extend the classical results to quantum theory. We introduce families of quantum maximal correlation coefficients and identify quantum $\chi^{2}$-divergences as non-commutative generalizations of the variance of the likelihood ratio. We establish a family of maximal correlation coefficients that must all be ordered on a single copy level for an arbitrary number of copies of one state to be able to be converted to a single copy of another target state under local operations. We prove the equivalent characterizations of perfect classical correlation extraction via local operations in quantum theory. We clarify the relationship between maximal correlation and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients by proving they are the same operator norms evaluated on distinct maps. Then we establish new equivalent conditions to the saturation of the data processing inequality for $\chi^{2}$-divergences. This implies previous saturation results for the $\chi^{2}$ and sandwiched R\'{e}nyi divergences. Finally, we establish the quantum maximal correlation coefficients and $\chi^{2}$-contraction coefficients are often efficiently computable. This results in a generic method for efficiently computing mixing times of time-homogeneous quantum Markov chains with a unique full rank fixed point.</description>

      <title>Cost-Free Personalization via Information-Geometric Projection in Bayesian Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) combines uncertainty modeling with decentralized training, enabling the development of personalized and reliable models under data heterogeneity and privacy constraints. Existing approaches typically rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational inference, often incorporating personalization mechanisms to better adapt to local data distributions. In this work, we propose an information-geometric projection framework for personalization in parametric BFL. By projecting the global model onto a neighborhood of the user's local model, our method enables a tunable trade-off between global generalization and local specialization. Under mild assumptions, we show that this projection step is equivalent to computing a barycenter on the statistical manifold, allowing us to derive closed-form solutions and achieve cost-free personalization. We apply the proposed approach to a variational learning setup using the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) optimizer and extend its application to general aggregation schemes in BFL. Empirical evaluations under heterogeneous data distributions confirm that our method effectively balances global and local performance with minimal computational overhead.</description>
