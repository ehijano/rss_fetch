      <title>Development of the Complex Nexus of Socio-Techno-Economic-Environmental Parametric (STEEP) Metrics for Evaluating Coal-to-Clean Energy Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitioning from coal to clean energy, such as nuclear and renewables, is essential for mitigating climate change, improving air quality, and ensuring sustainable energy security. Reducing reliance on coal lowers greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, which enhances public health and economic growth through renewable energy investments. Clean energy also fosters energy independence and long-term sustainability. This paper presents a Complex Nexus of Socio-Techno-Economic-Environmental Parametric (STEEP) Metrics to systematically evaluate and guide these transitions, facilitating informed decision-making and optimizing resource allocation. The methodology is classified into three approaches: optimal site selection using a multi-criteria decision-making framework that ranks coal plant sites based on societal, technical, economic, and environmental criteria; long-term planning evaluation through performance indicators comparing Greenfield, Coal-to-Nuclear (C2N), and Coal-to-Integrated Energy Systems (C2IES); and short-term operational benefits assessment using the Unit Commitment Economic Dispatch (UCED) model to optimize generator scheduling and minimize costs across various scenarios. This framework enables practical analysis of coal-to-clean transitions, identifying the best strategies for implementation.</description>

      <title>Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Applicability of spatial early warning signals to complex network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early warning signals (EWSs) for complex dynamical systems aim to anticipate tipping points, or large regime shifts, before they occur. While signals computed from time series data, such as temporal variance and lagged autocorrelation functions, are useful for this task, they are costly to obtain in practice because they need many samples over time to calculate. Spatial EWSs use just a single sample per spatial location and aggregate the samples over space rather than time to try to mitigate this limitation. However, although many complex systems in nature and society form diverse networks, the performance of spatial EWSs is mostly unknown for general networks because the vast majority of studies of spatial EWSs have been on regular lattice networks. Therefore, we have carried out a comprehensive investigation of four major spatial EWSs on various networks. We find that the winning EWS depends on tipping scenarios, while spatial skewness tends to excel when tipping occurs via a saddle-node bifurcation, which is a commonly studied scenario in the literature. We also find that spatial EWSs behave in a drastically different manner between the square lattice and complex networks and tend to be more reliable for the latter than the former according to a standard performance measure. The present results encourage further studies of spatial EWSs on complex networks.</description>

      <title>Increasing volume and decreasing disruption in US case law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Law evolves with society. As population growth and social changes give rise to new issues and conflicts, additional laws are introduced into the existing legal system. These new laws not only expand the volume of the system but can also disrupt it by overturning or replacing older laws. In this paper, we demonstrate that these two aspects of legal evolution, i.e., growth and disruption, can be effectively described and explained through the application of two computational frameworks to US case law data. Our analysis shows that the volume of case law has been growing at a rate faster than population growth, with the scaling exponent of 1.74, while its average disruptiveness has decreased over the past two centuries. This finding implies that the increasing size and complexity of the legal system make it harder for individual cases to drive significant change. Nevertheless, we find that social structural factors such as authority and ideology can empower lawmakers to overcome this inertia and still produce disruptions under certain conditions. Specifically, lawmakers with greater authority generate more disruptive rulings, and political liberalism and ideological consensus among those with the highest authority leads to greater disruption. This result suggests that increasing ideological polarization may be contributing to the decline in disruption within US case law.</description>

      <title>Urbanization, economic development, and income distribution dynamics in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India's urbanization is often characterized as particularly challenging and very unequal but systematic empirical analyses, comparable to other nations, have largely been lacking. Here, we characterize India's economic and human development along with changes in its personal income distribution as a function of the nation's growing urbanization. On aggregate, we find that India outperforms most other nations in the growth of various indicators of development with urbanization, including income and human development. These results are due in part to India's present low levels of urbanization but also demonstrate the transformational role of its cities in driving multi-dimensional development. To test these changes at the more local level, we study the income distributions of large Indian cities to find evidence for high positive growth in the lowest decile (poorest) of the population, enabling sharp reductions in poverty over time. We also test the hypothesis that inequality-reducing cities are more attractive destinations for rural migrants. Finally, we use income distributions to characterize changes in poverty rates directly. This shows much lower levels of poverty in urban India and especially in its largest cities. The dynamics of poverty rates during the recent COVID-19 pandemic shows both a high fragility of these improvements during a crisis and their resilience over longer times. Sustaining a long-term dynamic where urbanization continues to be closely associated with human development and poverty reduction is likely India's fastest path to a more prosperous and equitable future.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models can Achieve Social Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social balance is a concept in sociology which states that if every three individuals in a population achieve certain structures of positive or negative interactions, then the whole population ends up in one faction of positive interactions or divided between two or more antagonistic factions. In this paper, we consider a group of interacting large language models (LLMs) and study how, after continuous interactions, they can achieve social balance. Across three different LLM models, we found that social balance depends on (i) whether interactions are updated based on "relationships", "appraisals", or "opinions"; (ii) whether agents update their interactions based on homophily or influence from their peers; and (iii) the number of simultaneous interactions the LLMs consider. When social balance is achieved, its particular structure of positive or negative interactions depends on these three conditions and are different across LLM models and sizes. The stability of interactions and the justification for their update also vary across models. Thus, social balance is driven by the pre-training and alignment particular to each LLM model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fast simulation technique for modeling epidemics on adaptive networks. Our rejection-based algorithm efficiently simulates the co-evolution of the network structure and the epidemic dynamics. We extend the classical SIS model by incorporating stochastic rules that allow for the association of susceptible nodes and the dissociation of infected nodes. The method outperforms standard baselines in terms of computational efficiency while revealing new emergent patterns in epidemic spread.

      <title>Matrix-weighted networks for modeling multidimensional dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are powerful tools for modeling interactions in complex systems. While traditional networks use scalar edge weights, many real-world systems involve multidimensional interactions. For example, in social networks, individuals often have multiple interconnected opinions that can affect different opinions of other individuals, which can be better characterized by matrices. We propose a novel, general framework for modeling such multidimensional interacting dynamics: matrix-weighted networks (MWNs). We present the mathematical foundations of MWNs and examine consensus dynamics and random walks within this context. Our results reveal that the coherence of MWNs gives rise to non-trivial steady states that generalize the notions of communities and structural balance in traditional networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network structure has a large impact on constant-selection evolutionary dynamics, with which multiple types of fitness (i.e., strength) compete on the network. Here we study constant-selection dynamics on two-layer networks in which the fitness of a node in one layer affects that in the other layer, under birth-death processes and uniform initialization, which are commonly assumed. We show mathematically and numerically that two-layer networks are suppressors of selection, which means that they suppress the effects of the different fitness values among the different types on the final outcomes of the evolutionary dynamics (called fixation probability) relative to the constituent one-layer networks. In fact, many two-layer networks are suppressors of selection relative to the most basic baseline, the Moran process. This result is in stark contrast with the results for conventional one-layer networks for which most networks are amplifiers of selection.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, simulations of pedestrians using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have been studied. This study considered the roads on a grid-world environment, and implemented pedestrians as MARL agents using an echo-state network and the least squares policy iteration method. Under this environment, the ability of these agents to learn to move forward by avoiding other agents was investigated. Specifically, we considered two types of tasks: the choice between a narrow direct route and a broad detour, and the bidirectional pedestrian flow in a corridor. The simulations results indicated that the learning was successful when the density of the agents was not that high.</description>

      <title>Assessing your Observatory's Impact: Best Practices in Establishing and Maintaining Observatory Bibliographies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observatories need to measure and evaluate the scientific output and overall impact of their facilities. An observatory bibliography consists of the papers published using that observatory's data, typically gathered by searching the major journals for relevant keywords. Recently, the volume of literature and methods by which the publications pool is evaluated has increased. Efficient and standardized procedures are necessary to assign meaningful metadata; enable user-friendly retrieval; and provide the opportunity to derive reports, statistics, and visualizations to impart a deeper understanding of the research output. In 2021, a group of observatory bibliographers from around the world convened online to continue the discussions presented in Lagerstrom (2015). We worked to extract general guidelines from our experiences, techniques, and lessons learnt. The paper explores the development, application, and current status of telescope bibliographies and future trends. This paper briefly describes the methodologies employed in constructing databases, along with the various bibliometric techniques used to analyze and interpret them. We explain reasons for non-standardization and why it is essential for each observatory to identify metadata and metrics that are meaningful for them; caution the (over-)use of comparisons among facilities that are, ultimately, not comparable through bibliometrics; and highlight the benefits of telescope bibliographies, both for researchers within the astronomical community and for stakeholders beyond the specific observatories. There is tremendous diversity in the ways bibliographers track publications and maintain databases, due to parameters such as resources, type of observatory, historical practices, and reporting requirements to funders and outside agencies. However, there are also common sets of Best Practices.</description>

      <title>State Discretization for Continuous-State MDPs in Infectious Disease Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repeated decision-making problems under uncertainty may arise in the health policy context, such as infectious disease control for COVID-19 and other epidemics. These problems may sometimes be effectively solved using Markov decision processes (MDPs). However, the continuous or large state space of such problems for capturing infectious disease prevalence renders it difficult to implement tractable MDPs to identify the optimal disease control policy over time. We therefore develop an algorithm for discretizing continuous states for approximate MDP solutions in this context. We benchmark performance against a uniform discretization using both a synthetic example and an example of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County.</description>

      <title>Uncovering multi-order Popularity and Similarity Mechanisms in Link Prediction by graphlet predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link prediction has become a critical problem in network science and has thus attracted increasing research interest. Popularity and similarity are two primary mechanisms in the formation of real networks. However, the roles of popularity and similarity mechanisms in link prediction across various domain networks remain poorly understood. Accordingly, this study used orbit degrees of graphlets to construct multi-order popularity- and similarity-based network link predictors, demonstrating that traditional popularity- and similarity-based indices can be efficiently represented in terms of orbit degrees. Moreover, we designed a supervised learning model that fuses multiple orbit-degree-based features and validated its link prediction performance. We also evaluated the mean absolute Shapley additive explanations of each feature within this model across 550 real-world networks from six domains. We observed that the homophily mechanism, which is a similarity-based feature, dominated social networks, with its win rate being 91\%. Moreover, a different similarity-based feature was prominent in economic, technological, and information networks. Finally, no single feature dominated the biological and transportation networks. The proposed approach improves the accuracy and interpretability of link prediction, thus facilitating the analysis of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>
