      <title>Coherent Organization of Passive Scalar from a Point-Source in a Turbulent Boundary Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial organization of a passive scalar plume originating from a point source in a boundary layer is studied to understand its meandering characteristics. We focus shortly downstream of the isokinetic injection ($1.5\le x/\delta \le 3$, $\delta$ being boundary layer thickness) where the scalar concentration is highly intermittent, the plume rapidly meanders, and breaks-up into concentrated scalar pockets due to the action of turbulent structures. Two injection locations were considered: the center of logarithmic-region and the wake-region of the boundary layer. Simultaneous quantitative planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle-image velocimetry (PIV) were performed in a wind-tunnel, using acetone vapors to measure scalar mixture fraction and velocity fields. Single- and multi-point statistics were compared to established works to validate the diagnostic novelties. Additionally, the spatial characteristics of the plume intermittency were quantified using `blob' size, shape, orientation and mean concentration. It was observed that straining and break up were the primary plume-evolution modes in this region, with little small-scale homogenization. Further, the dominant role of coherent vortex motions in meandering and break-up of the plume was evident. Their action is found to be the primary mechanism by which the scalar injected within the log-region is transported away from the wall (`large meander events'). Strong spatial correlation was observed in both instantaneous and conditional fields between the high scalar concentration regions and the individual vortex heads. This coherent transport was weaker for wake-injection case, where the plume only interacts with outer vortex motions. A coherent-structure based mechanism is suggested to explain these transport mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Velocity gradient partitioning in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocity gradient tensor can be decomposed into axial straining, pure shearing, and rigid rotation tensors, each with distinct symmetry and normality properties. We partition the strength of velocity gradient fluctuations based on the relative contributions of these constituents in several turbulent flows. These flows include forced isotropic turbulence, channels and boundary layers, and subsonic and transonic jets. For forced isotropic turbulence, the partitioning is in excellent agreement with previous results. For wall-bounded turbulence, the partitioning collapses onto the isotropic partitioning far from the wall, where the mean shearing is relatively weak. By contrast, the near-wall partitioning is dominated by shearing. Between these two regimes, the partitioning collapses well at sufficiently high friction Reynolds numbers and its variations in the buffer layer and the log-law region can be reasonably modeled as a function of the mean shearing strength. The isotropic partitioning also applies throughout much of the turbulent jets due to the rapid decay of the mean flow shear layer near the nozzle lip. Before reaching the exterior potential flow regime, the relative contribution of rigid rotation around the turbulent/non-turbulent interface is enhanced with respect to the isotropic partitioning. Altogether, our results highlight the broad applicability of the velocity gradient partitioning to turbulence modeling.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired information entropy in multi-field turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel information entropy of turbulence systems with multiple field quantities is formulated. Inspired by quantum mechanics, the von Neumann entropy (vNE) and the entanglement entropy(EE) are derived from a density matrix for the turbulence state in terms of the multi-field singular value decomposition (MFSVD). Applying the information-theoretic entropy analyses to spatio-temporal dynamics in turbulent plasmas with phase-transition-like behavior, we discover a new nontrivial transition threshold regarding the vNE, which significantly deviates from the transition threshold of the field energy considered in the conventional approaches. These findings provide us with new classifications of the turbulence state in terms of combined energy and information. It is also shown that the EE for nonlinear interactions in turbulence simultaneously describes not only the information for the strength of nonlinear mode couplings but also the direction of net energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.</description>

      <title>An improved formulation for the wake-added turbulence for intra-farm and farm-to-farm wake modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an improved formulation for the wake-added turbulence to enhance the accuracy of intra-farm and farm-to-farm wake modeling through analytical frameworks. Our goal is to address the tendency of a commonly used formulation to overestimate turbulence intensity within wind farms and to overcome its limitations in predicting the streamwise evolution of turbulence intensity beyond them. To this end, we utilize high-fidelity data and adopt an optimization technique to derive an optimized functional form of the wake-added turbulence. We then integrate the achieved formulation with a widely used Gaussian wake model to study various intra-farm and farm-to-farm scenarios. The outcomes reveal that the new methodology effectively addresses the overestimation of power in both standalone wind farms and those impacted by upstream counterparts. Our new approach meets the need for accurate and lightweight models, ensuring the effective coexistence of wind farms within clusters as the wind-energy capacity rapidly expands.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Mode Decomposition of Geostrophically Balanced and Unbalanced Motions from SWOT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of oceanic flow into its balanced and unbalanced motions carries theoretical and practical significance for the oceanographic community. These two motions have distinct dynamical characteristics and affect the transport of tracers differently from one another. The launch of Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite provides a prime opportunity to diagnose the surface balanced and unbalanced motions on a global scale at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Here, we apply dynamic-mode decomposition (DMD), a linear-algebraic data-driven method, to a tidally-forced numerical simulation and one-day-repeat SWOT observations of sea-surface height (SSH) in the Gulf Stream extension. DMD is able to separate out the spatial modes associated with sub-inertial periods from super-inertial periods. The sub-inertial modes of DMD can be used to extract geostrophically balanced motions from SSH fields, which have an imprint of internal tides.</description>

      <title>Smooth vs. Physical Solutions of the Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14734v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smooth solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations of the class considered by Leray and Hopf exist. They describe the mean state of a turbulent flow but do not describe a turbulent state itself. They fail the admissibility criterion of a maximum rate of entropy production. They have zero entropy, zero turbulent fluctuations and are laminar. For the same general initial conditions, the physically admissible solution of the turbulent flow exists as a Young measure, with a stochastic formulation. The proofs are supported by renormalized perturbation series, which is constructed as a modification of the renormalized perturbation series of quantum field theory. This expansion is shown to converge for the vacuum state and other physical states. It gives a statistical description of the lowest energy fully turbulent state, usually referred to as fully developed turbulence. This state is statisticly stationary and translation invariant. Topologically, the moments are interpreted in terms of energy and vorticity surfaces in R3 in the form of spheres and possibly knotted tori of arbitrary genus. Considerations of phase transitions within turbulent flow lead to a conjectured unified picture of phase transitions within fluids, Yang-Mills fields with quarks and quantum general rel</description>

      <title>Direct Statistical Simulation Using Generalised Cumulant Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07204v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the Generalised Quasilinear (GQL) approximation has been developed and its efficacy tested against purely quasilinear (QL) approximations. GQL systematically interpolates between QL and fully non-linear dynamics by employing a generalised Reynolds decomposition. Here, we examine an exact statistical closure for the GQL equations on the doubly periodic $\beta$-plane. Closure is achieved at second order using a generalised cumulant approach which we term GCE2. GCE2 is shown to yield improved performance over statistical representations of purely QL dynamics (CE2) and thus enables Direct Statistical Simulation (DSS) of complex mean flows that do not entirely fall within the remit of pure QL theory. Despite the existence of an exact closure, GCE2 like CE2 admits the possibility of a rank instability that leads to differences with statistics obtained from GQL. Recognition of this instability is a necessary step before further progress can be made with the GCE2 statistical closure.</description>

      <title>Effect of a shear flow on the Darrieus-Landau instability in a Hele-Shaw channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Darrieus--Landau instability of premixed flames propagating in a narrow Hele-Shaw channel in the presence of a strong shear flow is investigated, incorporating also the Rayleigh--Taylor and diffusive-thermal instabilities. The flow induces shear-enhanced diffusion (Taylor dispersion) in the streamwise direction, but not in the spanwise direction and this leads to anisotropic diffusion and flame propagation. To understand how such anisotropies affect flame stability, two important cases are considered. These correspond to initial unperturbed conditions pertaining to a planar flame propagating in the streamwise or spanwise directions. The analysis is based on a two-dimensional model derived by asymptotic methods and solved numerically. These address the influence of the shear-flow strength (or Peclet number $Pe$), preferential diffusion (or Lewis number $Le$) and gravity (or Rayleigh number $Ra$). Dispersion curves characterizing the perturbation growth rate are computed for selected values of $Pe$, $Le$ and $Ra$. Taylor dispersion induced by strong shear flows is found to suppress the Darrieus--Landau instability and to weaken the flame wrinkling when the flame propagates in the streamwise direction. In contrast, when the flame propagates in the spanwise direction, the flame is stabilized in $Le&lt;1$ mixtures, but destabilized in $Le&gt;1$ mixtures. In the latter case, Taylor dispersion coupled with gas expansion facilitates flame wrinkling in an unusual manner. Specifically, stagnation points and counter-rotating vortices are encountered in the flame close to the unburnt gas side. More generally, an original finding is the demonstration that vorticity can be produced by a curved flame in a Hele-Shaw channel even in the absence of gravity, whenever $Pe \neq 0$, and that the vorticity remains confined to the flame preheat and reaction zones.</description>

      <title>Perpendicular separations of a binary mixture under van der Waals confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the dynamics of a binary mixture confined within van der Waals (vdW) walls using molecular dynamics simulations. We discovered a novel phenomenon named perpendicular separations of two phases (PSTP). In the initial stage, central water molecules diffused, subsequently condensing symmetrically within the confinement's mid-plane. In the later stage, as water droplets nucleate and grow, the resin separates perpendicularly into two films due to the action of bubblers and vdW walls, resulting in a hollow nanochannel. The mechanisms and conditions underlying PSTS are discussed. The results indicate that the concentration (C) of resin in the middle region is linearly decreased with temporal power. We propose a new mechanism for stabilizing nanochannels and films: dynamic "soft pillars" that prevent Rayleigh-like instability. Our findings could shed light on the manufacture of nanofilms and organic nanochannels, which could help advance bio-detection and energy fields.</description>

      <title>Physics-aware Machine Learning Revolutionizes Scientific Paradigm for Machine Learning and Process-based Hydrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05227v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate hydrological understanding and water cycle prediction are crucial for addressing scientific and societal challenges associated with the management of water resources, particularly under the dynamic influence of anthropogenic climate change. Existing reviews predominantly concentrate on the development of machine learning (ML) in this field, yet there is a clear distinction between hydrology and ML as separate paradigms. Here, we introduce physics-aware ML as a transformative approach to overcome the perceived barrier and revolutionize both fields. Specifically, we present a comprehensive review of the physics-aware ML methods, building a structured community (PaML) of existing methodologies that integrate prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into ML. We systematically analyze these PaML methodologies with respect to four aspects: physical data-guided ML, physics-informed ML, physics-embedded ML, and physics-aware hybrid learning. PaML facilitates ML-aided hypotheses, accelerating insights from big data and fostering scientific discoveries. We first conduct a systematic review of hydrology in PaML, including rainfall-runoff hydrological processes and hydrodynamic processes, and highlight the most promising and challenging directions for different objectives and PaML methods. Finally, a new PaML-based hydrology platform, termed HydroPML, is released as a foundation for hydrological applications. HydroPML enhances the explainability and causality of ML and lays the groundwork for the digital water cycle's realization. The HydroPML platform is publicly available at https://hydropml.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Aquatic Soft Robots with Elastic Instability Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sinusoidal undulation has long been considered the most successful swimming pattern for fish and bionic aquatic robots [1]. However, a swimming pattern generated by the hair clip mechanism (HCM, part iii, Figure 1A) [2]~[5] may challenge this knowledge. HCM is an in-plane prestressed bi-stable mechanism that stores elastic energy and releases the stored energy quickly via its snap-through buckling. When used for fish robots, the HCM functions as the fish body and creates unique swimming patterns that we term HCM undulation. With the same energy consumption [3], HCM fish outperforms the traditionally designed soft fish with a two-fold increase in cruising speed. We reproduce this phenomenon in a single-link simulation with Aquarium [6]. HCM undulation generates an average propulsion of 16.7 N/m, 2-3 times larger than the reference undulation (6.78 N/m), sine pattern (5.34 N/m/s), and cambering sine pattern (6.36 N/m), and achieves an efficiency close to the sine pattern. These results can aid in developing fish robots and faster swimming patterns.</description>
