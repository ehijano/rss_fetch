      <title>The Geodesic Fr\'echet Distance Between Two Curves Bounding a Simple Polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet distance is a popular similarity measure that is well-understood for polygonal curves in $\mathbb{R}^d$: near-quadratic time algorithms exist, and conditional lower bounds suggest that these results cannot be improved significantly, even in one dimension and when approximating with a factor less than three. We consider the special case where the curves bound a simple polygon and distances are measured via geodesics inside this simple polygon. Here the conditional lower bounds do not apply; Efrat $et$ $al.$ (2002) were able to give a near-linear time $2$-approximation algorithm.
  In this paper, we significantly improve upon their result: we present a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, that runs in $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon} (n+m \log n) \log nm \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for a simple polygon bounded by two curves with $n$ and $m$ vertices, respectively. To do so, we show how to compute the reachability of specific groups of points in the free space at once and in near-linear time, by interpreting their free space as one between separated one-dimensional curves. Bringmann and K\"unnemann (2015) previously solved the decision version of the Fr\'echet distance in this setting in $\mathcal{O}((n+m) \log nm)$ time. We strengthen their result and compute the Fr\'echet distance between two separated one-dimensional curves in linear time. Finally, we give a linear time exact algorithm if the two curves bound a convex polygon.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology with Path-Representable Distances on Graph Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological data analysis over graph has been actively studied to understand the underlying topological structure of data. However, limited research has been conducted on how different distance definitions impact persistent homology and the corresponding topological inference. To address this, we introduce the concept of path-representable distance in a general form and prove the main theorem for the case of cost-dominated distances. We found that a particular injection exists among the $1$-dimensional persistence barcodes of these distances with a certain condition. We prove that such an injection relation exists for $0$- and $1$-dimensional homology. For higher dimensions, we provide the counterexamples that show such a relation does not exist.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Parameterized Approximation Schemes for Hybrid Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid $k$-Clustering is a model of clustering that generalizes two of the most widely studied clustering objectives: $k$-Center and $k$-Median. In this model, given a set of $n$ points $P$, the goal is to find $k$ centers such that the sum of the $r$-distances of each point to its nearest center is minimized. The $r$-distance between two points $p$ and $q$ is defined as $\max\{d(p, q)-r, 0\}$ -- this represents the distance of $p$ to the boundary of the $r$-radius ball around $q$ if $p$ is outside the ball, and $0$ otherwise. This problem was recently introduced by Fomin et al. [APPROX 2024], who designed a $(1+\varepsilon, 1+\varepsilon)$-bicrtieria approximation that runs in time $2^{(kd/\varepsilon)^{O(1)}} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ for inputs in $\mathbb{R}^d$; such a bicriteria solution uses balls of radius $(1+\varepsilon)r$ instead of $r$, and has a cost at most $1+\varepsilon$ times the cost of an optimal solution using balls of radius $r$.
  In this paper we significantly improve upon this result by designing an approximation algorithm with the same bicriteria guarantee, but with running time that is FPT only in $k$ and $\varepsilon$ -- crucially, removing the exponential dependence on the dimension $d$. This resolves an open question posed in their paper. Our results extend further in several directions. First, our approximation scheme works in a broader class of metric spaces, including doubling spaces, minor-free, and bounded treewidth metrics. Secondly, our techniques yield a similar bicriteria FPT-approximation schemes for other variants of Hybrid $k$-Clustering, e.g., when the objective features the sum of $z$-th power of the $r$-distances. Finally, we also design a coreset for Hybrid $k$-Clustering in doubling spaces, answering another open question from the work of Fomin et al.</description>
