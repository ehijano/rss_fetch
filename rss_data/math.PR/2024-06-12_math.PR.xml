      <title>Simultaneous global inviscid Burgers flows with periodic Poisson forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inviscid Burgers equation on the circle $\mathbb{T}:=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ forced by the derivative of a Poisson point process on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. We construct global solutions with mean $\theta$ simultaneously for all $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$, and in addition construct their associated global shocks (which are unique except on a countable set of $\theta$). We then show that as $\theta$ changes, the solution only changes through the movement of the global shock, and give precise formulas for this movement. This is an analogue of previous results by the author and Yu Gu in the viscous case with white-in-time forcing, which related the derivative of the solution in $\theta$ to the density of a particle diffusing in the Burgers flow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=(X_t, t\geq 0)$ be a superprocess in a random environment described by a Gaussian noise $W=\{W(t,x), t\geq 0, x\in \mathbb{R}^d\}$ white in time and colored in space with correlation kernel $g(x,y)$. When $d\geq 3$, under the condition that the correlation function $g(x,y)$ is bounded above by some appropriate function $\bar{g}(x-y)$, we present the quenched and annealed Strong Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorems regarding the weighted occupation measure $\int_0^t X_s ds$ as $t\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>New density/likelihood representations for Gibbs models based on generating functionals of point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving exact density functions for Gibbs point processes has been challenging due to their general intractability, stemming from the intractability of their normalising constants/partition functions. This paper offers a solution to this open problem by exploiting a recent alternative representation of point process densities. Here, for a finite point process, the density is expressed as the void probability multiplied by a higher-order Papangelou conditional intensity function. By leveraging recent results on dependent thinnings, exact expressions for generating functionals and void probabilities of locally stable point processes are derived. Consequently, exact expressions for density/likelihood functions, partition functions and posterior densities are also obtained. The paper finally extends the results to locally stable Gibbsian random fields on lattices by representing them as point processes.</description>

      <title>Convex hull of Brownian motion and Brownian bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the convex hull spanned by the union of trajectories of a standard planar Brownian motion, and an independent standard planar Brownian bridge. We find exact values of the expectation of perimeter and area of such a convex hull. As an auxiliary result, that is of interest in its own right, we provide an explicit shape of the probability density function of a random variable that represents the time when combined maximum of a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion, and an independent standard one-dimensional Brownian bridge is attained. At the end, we generalize our results to the case of multiple independent standard planar Brownian motions and Brownian bridges.</description>

Abstract: In the recent work [arXiv:2308.03216], Coghi and Maurelli proved pathwise uniqueness of solutions to the vorticity form of stochastic 2D Euler equation, with Kraichnan transport noise and initial data in $L^1\cap L^p$ for $p&gt;3/2$. The aim of this note is to remove the constraint on $p$, showing that pathwise uniqueness holds for all $L^1\cap L^p$ initial data with arbitrary $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider convergence properties of the long-term behaviors with respect to the coefficient of the stochastic term for a nonautonomous stochastic $p$-Laplacian lattice equation with multiplicative noise. First, the upper semi-continuity of pullback random $(\ell^2,\ell^q)$-attractor is proved for each $q\in[1,+\infty)$. Then, a convergence result of the time-dependent invariant sample Borel probability measures is obtained in $\ell^2$. Next, we show that the invariant sample measures satisfy a stochastic Liouville type equation and a termwise convergence of the stochastic Liouville type equations is verified. Furthermore, each family of the invariant sample measures is turned out to be a sample statistical solution, which hence also fulfills a convergence consequence.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Magnetohydrodynamics Models as Scaling Limits of Stochastic Induction Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of a stochastic model for the induction equations of the magnetic field in a three dimensional periodic domain. The turbulent velocity field driving the electromotive force on the magnetic field is modeled by a noise white in time. For this model we rigorously take a scaling limit leading to a deterministic model. While in case of isotropic turbulence this produces an additional dissipation in the limit model which influences also the decay rate of the Magnetic field in the stochastic model, the case of turbulence devoloped in a preferential direction allows us to find a dynamo effect.</description>

      <title>Sum the Probabilities to $m$ and Stop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the optimal selection of the last $m$th success in a sequence of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials. We propose a threshold strategy that is $\varepsilon$-optimal under minimal assumptions about the monotonicity of the trials' success probabilities. This new strategy ensures stopping at most one step earlier than the optimal rule. Specifically, the new threshold coincides with the point where the sum of success probabilities in the remaining trials equals $m$. We show that the underperformance of the new rule, in comparison to the optimal one, is of the order $O(n^{-2})$ in the case of a Karamata-Stirling success profile with parameter $\theta &gt; 0$ where $p_k = \theta / (\theta + k - 1)$ for the $k$th trial. We further leverage the classical weak convergence of the number of successes in the trials to a Poisson random variable to derive the asymptotic solution of the stopping problem. Finally, we present illustrative results highlighting the close performance between the two rules.</description>

      <title>From rank-based models with common noise to pathwise entropy solutions of SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mean field limit of a rank-based model with common noise, which arises as an extension to models for the market capitalization of firms in stochastic portfolio theory. We show that, under certain conditions on the drift and diffusion coefficients, the empirical cumulative distribution function converges to the solution of a stochastic PDE. A key step in the proof, which is of independent interest, is to show that any solution to an associated martingale problem is also a pathwise entropy solution to the stochastic PDE, a notion introduced in a recent series of papers [32, 33, 19, 16, 17].</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic autonomous robustness of random attractors for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the existence and asymptotically autonomous robustness (AAR) (almost surely) of random attractors for 3D stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations (SGMNSE) on Poincar\'e domains (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aim is to investigate the existence and AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE when the time-dependent forcing converges to a time-independent function under the perturbation of linear multiplicative noise as well as additive noise. The main approach is to provide a way to justify that, on some uniformly tempered universe, the usual pullback asymptotic compactness of the solution operators is uniform across an infinite time-interval $(-\infty,\tau]$. The backward uniform ``tail-smallness'' and ``flattening-property'' of the solutions over $(-\infty,\tau]$ have been demonstrated to achieve this goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish the existence as well as AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE on unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Change of numeraire for weak martingale transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change of numeraire is a classical tool in mathematical finance. Campi-Laachir-Martini established its applicability to martingale optimal transport. We note that the results of Campi-Laachir-Martini extend to the case of weak martingale transport. We apply this to shadow couplings, continuous time martingale transport problems in the framework of Huesmann-Trevisan and in particular to establish the correspondence between stretched Brownian motion with its geometric counterpart.
  Note: We emphasize that we learned about the geometric stretched Brownian motion gSBM (defined in PDE terms) in a presentation of Loeper \cite{Lo23} before our work on this topic started. We noticed that a change of numeraire transformation in the spirit of \cite{CaLaMa14} allows for an alternative viewpoint in the weak optimal transport framework. We make our work public following the publication of Backhoff-Loeper-Obloj's work \cite{BaLoOb24} on arxiv.org. The article \cite{BaLoOb24} derives gSBM using PDE techniques as well as through an independent probabilistic approach which is close to the one we give in the present article.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning in Non-Abelian Environments: Unveiling Novel Formulations and Quantum Advantage Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into recent advancements in Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), particularly focusing on non-commutative environments, which represent uncharted territory in this field. Our research endeavors to redefine the boundaries of decision-making by introducing formulations and strategies that harness the inherent properties of quantum systems.
  At the core of our investigation characterization of the agent's state space within a Hilbert space ($\mathcal{H}$). Here, quantum states emerge as complex superpositions of classical state introducing non-commutative quantum actions governed by unitary operators, necessitating a reimagining of state transitions. Complementing this framework is a refined reward function, rooted in quantum mechanics as a Hermitian operator on $\mathcal{H}$. This reward function serves as the foundation for the agent's decision-making process. By leveraging the quantum Bellman equation, we establish a methodology for maximizing expected cumulative reward over an infinite horizon, considering the entangled dynamics of quantum systems. We also connect the Quantum Bellman Equation to the Degree of Non Commutativity of the Environment, evident in Pure Algebra.
  We design a quantum advantage function. This ingeniously designed function exploits latent quantum parallelism inherent in the system, enhancing the agent's decision-making capabilities and paving the way for exploration of quantum advantage in uncharted territories. Furthermore, we address the significant challenge of quantum exploration directly, recognizing the limitations of traditional strategies in this complex environment.</description>

      <title>On Extremal Problems Associated with Random Chords on a Circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Karamata, we consider an extremization problem associated with the probability of intersecting two random chords inside a circle of radius $r, \, r \in (0,1]$, where the endpoints of the chords are drawn according to a given probability distribution on $\mathbb{S}^1$.
  We show that, for $r=1,$ the problem is degenerated in the sense that any continuous measure is an extremiser, and that, for $r$ sufficiently close to $1,$ the desired maximal value is strictly below the one for $r=1$ by a polynomial factor in $1-r.$ Finally, we prove, by considering the auxiliary problem of drawing a single random chord, that the desired maximum is $1/4$ for $r \in (0,1/2).$ Connections with other variational problems and energy minimization problems are also presented.</description>

      <title>A local squared Wasserstein-2 method for efficient reconstruction of models with uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a local squared Wasserstein-2 (W_2) method to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing models with uncertain latent variables or parameters. A key advantage of our approach is that it does not require prior information on the distribution of the latent variables or parameters in the underlying models. Instead, our method can efficiently reconstruct the distributions of the output associated with different inputs based on empirical distributions of observation data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method across several uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks, including linear regression with coefficient uncertainty, training neural networks with weight uncertainty, and reconstructing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a latent random variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let Y be a random variable whose degenerate moment generating functions exist in some neighborhoods of the origin. The aim of this paper is to study the probabilistic degenerate Stirling numbers of the first kind associated with Y which are constructed from the degenerate cumulant generating function of Y. They are a degenerate version of the probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first kind associated with Y, which were recently introduced by Adell-Benyi. We investigate some properties, related identities, recurrence relations and explicit expressions for those numbers. In addition, we apply our results to the special cases of normal and gamma random variables.</description>

      <title>Inferring the dependence graph density of binary graphical models in high dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of binary interacting chains describing the dynamics of a group of $N$ components that, at each time unit, either send some signal to the others or remain silent otherwise. The interactions among the chains are encoded by a directed Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph with unknown parameter $ p \in (0, 1) .$ Moreover, the system is structured within two populations (excitatory chains versus inhibitory ones) which are coupled via a mean field interaction on the underlying Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph. In this paper, we address the question of inferring the connectivity parameter $p$ based only on the observation of the interacting chains over $T$ time units. In our main result, we show that the connectivity parameter $p$ can be estimated with rate $N^{-1/2}+N^{1/2}/T+(\log(T)/T)^{1/2}$ through an easy-to-compute estimator. Our analysis relies on a precise study of the spatio-temporal decay of correlations of the interacting chains. This is done through the study of coalescing random walks defining a backward regeneration representation of the system. Interestingly, we also show that this backward regeneration representation allows us to perfectly sample the system of interacting chains (conditionally on each realization of the underlying Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph) from its stationary distribution. These probabilistic results have an interest in its own.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of random scan Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference under log-concavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference scheme is a popular algorithm used to compute the mean-field approximation of a probability distribution of interest. We analyze its random scan version, under log-concavity assumptions on the target density. Our approach builds on the recent work of M. Arnese and D. Lacker, \emph{Convergence of coordinate ascent variational inference for log-concave measures via optimal transport} [arXiv:2404.08792] which studies the deterministic scan version of the algorithm, phrasing it as a block-coordinate descent algorithm in the space of probability distributions endowed with the geometry of optimal transport. We obtain tight rates for the random scan version, which imply that the total number of factor updates required to converge scales linearly with the condition number and the number of blocks of the target distribution. By contrast, available bounds for the deterministic scan case scale quadratically in the same quantities, which is analogue to what happens for optimization of convex functions in Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis of Homogeneous Wireless Networks Assisted by Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the impact of the existence of multiple IRSs in a homogeneous wireless network, in which all BSs, users (U), and IRSs are spatially distributed by an independent homogeneous PPP, with density $\lambda_{{\rm BS}}\rm{[BS/m^2]}$, $\lambda_{{\rm U}}\rm{[U/m^2]}$, and $\lambda_{{\rm IRS}}\rm{[IRS/m^2]}$, respectively. We utilize a uniformly random serving strategy for BS and IRS to create stochastic symmetry in the network. We analyze the performance of the network and study the effect of the existence of the IRS on the network performance. To this end, for a typical user in the system, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expectation of the power (second statistical moment) of the desired signal and the interference caused by BSs and other users. After that, we obtain analytical upper bounds on the decay of the probability of the power of the desired signal and the interference for the typical user (which results in a lower bound for the cumulative distribution function (CDF)). Moreover, we derive upper bounds on the decay of the probability of the capacity of one typical user, which results in a lower bound for the outage probability. In the numerical results, we observe that the numerical calculation of the power of the desired signal and the interference is near the derived lower bounds and we show that the increment of the parameter ${(\lambda_{\rm IRS})}$ causes increment in powers of both the desired and interference signals. We also observe that the increment of the parameter ${\lambda_{\rm IRS}}$ causes the decrement of outage probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.11076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a monotone approximation scheme for a class of fully nonlinear degenerate partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) which characterize the nonlinear $\alpha$-stable L\'{e}vy processes under sublinear expectation space with $\alpha \in(1,2)$. We further establish the error bounds for the monotone approximation scheme. This in turn yields an explicit Berry-Esseen bound and convergence rate for the $\alpha$-stable central limit theorem under sublinear expectation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, moderate deviations for normal approximation of functionals over infinitely many Rademacher random variables are derived. They are based on a bound for the Kolmogorov distance between a general Rademacher functional and a Gaussian random variable, continued by an intensive study of the behavior of operators from the Malliavin--Stein method along with the moment generating function of the mentioned functional. As applications, subgraph counting in the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph and infinite weighted 2-runs are studied.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation for Gibbs processes via disagreement couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work improves the existing central limit theorems (CLTs) for geometric functionals of Gibbs processes in three aspects. First, we derive a CLT for weakly stabilizing functionals, thereby improving on the previously used assumption of exponential stabilization. Second, we show that this CLT holds for interaction ranges up to the percolation threshold of the dominating Poisson process. This avoids imprecise branching bounds from graphical construction. Third, by constructing simultaneous couplings of several Palm processes for Gibbs functionals, we provide a quantitative CLT in terms of Kolmogorov bounds for normal approximation. An important conceptual ingredient in these advances is the extension of disagreement coupling adapted to unbounded windows and to the comparison at multiple spatial locations.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model and Vertex-Reinforced Jump Process on Regular Trees: Infinite-Order Transition and an Intermediate Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the supercritical phase of the vertex-reinforced jump process (VRJP) and the $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model on rooted regular trees. The VRJP is a random walk, which is more likely to jump to vertices on which it has previously spent a lot of time. The $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model is a supersymmetric lattice spin model, originally introduced as a toy model for the Anderson transition. On infinite rooted regular trees, the VRJP undergoes a recurrence/transience transition controlled by an inverse temperature parameter $\beta &gt; 0$. Approaching the critical point from the transient regime, $\beta \searrow \beta_{\mathrm{c}}$, we show that the expected total time spent at the starting vertex diverges as $\sim \exp(c/\sqrt{\beta - \beta_{\mathrm{c}}})$. Moreover, on large finite trees we show that the VRJP exhibits an additional intermediate regime for parameter values $\beta_{\mathrm{c}} &lt; \beta &lt; \beta_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{erg}}$. In this regime, despite being transient in infinite volume, the VRJP on finite trees spends an unusually long time at the starting vertex with high probability. We provide analogous results for correlation functions of the $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model. Our proofs rely on the application of branching random walk methods to a horospherical marginal of the $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model.</description>

      <title>Community detection in the hypergraph stochastic block model and reconstruction on hypertrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the weak recovery problem on the $r$-uniform hypergraph stochastic block model ($r$-HSBM) with two balanced communities. In this model, $n$ vertices are randomly divided into two communities, and size-$r$ hyperedges are added randomly depending on whether all vertices in the hyperedge are in the same community. The goal of weak recovery is to recover a non-trivial fraction of the communities given the hypergraph. Pal and Zhu (2021); Stephan and Zhu (2022) established that weak recovery is always possible above a natural threshold called the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. For assortative models (i.e., monochromatic hyperedges are preferred), Gu and Polyanskiy (2023) proved that the KS threshold is tight if $r\le 4$ or the expected degree $d$ is small. For other cases, the tightness of the KS threshold remained open.
  In this paper we determine the tightness of the KS threshold for a wide range of parameters. We prove that for $r\le 6$ and $d$ large enough, the KS threshold is tight. This shows that there is no information-computation gap in this regime and partially confirms a conjecture of Angelini et al. (2015). On the other hand, we show that for $r\ge 5$, there exist parameters for which the KS threshold is not tight. In particular, for $r\ge 7$, the KS threshold is not tight if the model is disassortative (i.e., polychromatic hyperedges are preferred) or $d$ is large enough. This provides more evidence supporting the existence of an information-computation gap in these cases.
  Furthermore, we establish asymptotic bounds on the weak recovery threshold for fixed $r$ and large $d$. We also obtain a number of results regarding the broadcasting on hypertrees (BOHT) model, including the asymptotics of the reconstruction threshold for $r\ge 7$ and impossibility of robust reconstruction at criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(Z^{(n)}_k)_{1 \leq k \leq n}$ be a random set of points and let $\mu_n$ be its \emph{empirical measure}:
  $$\mu_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \delta_{Z^{(n)}_k}. $$
  Let $$P_n(z) := (z - Z^{(n)}_1)\cdots (z - Z^{(n)}_n)\quad \text{and}\quad Q_n (z) := \sum_{k=1}^n \gamma^{(n)}_k \prod_{1 \leq j \leq n, j \neq k} (z- Z^{(n)}_j), $$ where $(\gamma^{(n)}_k)_{1 \leq k \leq n}$ are independent, i.i.d. random variables with Gamma distribution of parameter $\beta/2$, for some fixed $\beta &gt; 0$. We prove that in the case where $\mu_n$ almost surely tends to $\mu$ when $n \rightarrow \infty$, the empirical measure of the complex zeros of the \emph{randomized derivative} $Q_n$ also converges almost surely to $\mu$ when $n$ tends to infinity. Furthermore, for $k = o(n / \log n)$, we obtain that the zeros of the $k-$th \emph{randomized derivative} of $P_n$ converge to the limiting measure $\mu$ in the same sense. We also derive the same conclusion for a variant of the randomized derivative related to the unit circle.</description>

Abstract: Most of the results in the paper for Patricia tries have earlier been proved by Jaspar Ischebeck.
  We study the distribution of fringe trees in Patricia tries and compressed binary search trees; both cases are random binary trees that have been compressed by deleting vertices of outdegree 1 so that they are random full binary trees. The main results are central limit theorems for the number of fringe trees of a given type, which imply quenched and annealed limit results for the fringe tree distribution; for Patricia tries, this is complicated by periodic oscillations in the usual manner. We also consider extended fringe trees. The results are derived from earlier results for uncompressed tries and binary search trees. In the case of compressed binary search trees, it seems difficult to give a closed formula for the asymptotic fringe tree distribution, but we provide a recursion and give examples.</description>

      <title>Local central limit theorem for triangle counts in sparse random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X_H$ be the number of copies of a fixed graph $H$ in $G(n,p)$. In 2016, Gilmer and Kopparty conjectured that a local central limit theorem should hold for $X_H$ as long as $H$ is connected, $p \gg n^{-1/m(H)}$ and $n^2(1-p)\gg 1$. Recently, Sah and Sahwney showed that the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture holds for constant $p$. In this paper, we show that the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture holds for triangle counts in the sparse range. More precisely, if $p \in (4n^{-1/2}, 1/2)$, then \[\sup_{x\in \mathcal{L}}\left| \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2}-\sigma\cdot \mathbb{P}(X^* = x)\right|=n^{-1/2+o(1)}p^{1/2},\] where $\sigma^2 = \mathbb{V}\text{ar}(X_{K_3})$, $X^{*}=(X_{K_3}-\mathbb{E}(X_{K_3}))/\sigma$ and $\mathcal{L}$ is the support of $X^*$. By combining our result with the results of R\"ollin--Ross and Gilmer--Kopparty, this establishes the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture for triangle counts for $n^{-1}\ll p &lt; c$, for any constant $c\in (0,1)$. Our quantitative result is enough to prove that the triangle counts converge to an associated normal distribution also in the $\ell_1$-distance. This is the first local central limit theorem for subgraph counts above the $m_2$-density.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An aperiodic binary sequence of length $\ell$ is a doubly infinite sequence $f=\ldots,f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\ldots$ with $f_j \in \{-1,1\}$ when $0 \leq j &lt; \ell$ and and $f_j=0$ otherwise. Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves. The autocorrelation of $f$ at shift $s$ is the dot product of $f$ with the sequence obtained by translating $f$ by $s$ places. The demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. Low demerit factor therefore indicates low self-similarity under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that every $p$th central moment is a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients divided by $\ell^{2 p}$. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimators for Structured Generalized Linear Models via Approximate Message Passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d.\ Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of statistical models, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant designs. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Errors are Robustly Tamed in Cumulative Knowledge Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study processes of societal knowledge accumulation, where the validity of a new unit of knowledge depends both on the correctness of its derivation and on the validity of the units it depends on. A fundamental question in this setting is: If a constant fraction of the new derivations is wrong, can investing a constant fraction, bounded away from one, of effort ensure that a constant fraction of knowledge in society is valid? Ben-Eliezer, Mikulincer, Mossel, and Sudan (ITCS 2023) introduced a concrete probabilistic model to analyze such questions and showed an affirmative answer to this question. Their study, however, focuses on the simple case where each new unit depends on just one existing unit, and units attach according to a $\textit{preferential attachment rule}$.
  In this work, we consider much more general families of cumulative knowledge processes, where new units may attach according to varied attachment mechanisms and depend on multiple existing units. We also allow a (random) fraction of insertions of adversarial nodes.
  We give a robust affirmative answer to the above question by showing that for $\textit{all}$ of these models, as long as many of the units follow simple heuristics for checking a bounded number of units they depend on, all errors will be eventually eliminated. Our results indicate that preserving the quality of large interdependent collections of units of knowledge is feasible, as long as careful but not too costly checks are performed when new units are derived/deposited.</description>

      <title>Are Normalizing Flows the Key to Unlocking the Exponential Mechanism?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09200v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Exponential Mechanism (ExpM), designed for private optimization, has been historically sidelined from use on continuous sample spaces, as it requires sampling from a generally intractable density, and, to a lesser extent, bounding the sensitivity of the objective function. Any differential privacy (DP) mechanism can be instantiated as ExpM, and ExpM poses an elegant solution for private machine learning (ML) that bypasses inherent inefficiencies of DPSGD. This paper seeks to operationalize ExpM for private optimization and ML by using an auxiliary Normalizing Flow (NF), an expressive deep network for density learning, to approximately sample from ExpM density. The method, ExpM+NF is an alternative to SGD methods for model training. We prove a sensitivity bound for the $\ell^2$ loss permitting ExpM use with any sampling method. To test feasibility, we present results on MIMIC-III health data comparing (non-private) SGD, DPSGD, and ExpM+NF training methods' accuracy and training time. We find that a model sampled from ExpM+NF is nearly as accurate as non-private SGD, more accurate than DPSGD, and ExpM+NF trains faster than Opacus' DPSGD implementation. Unable to provide a privacy proof for the NF approximation, we present empirical results to investigate privacy including the LiRA membership inference attack of Carlini et al. and the recent privacy auditing lower bound method of Steinke et al. Our findings suggest ExpM+NF provides more privacy than non-private SGD, but not as much as DPSGD, although many attacks are impotent against any model. Ancillary benefits of this work include pushing the SOTA of privacy and accuracy on MIMIC-III healthcare data, exhibiting the use of ExpM+NF for Bayesian inference, showing the limitations of empirical privacy auditing in practice, and providing several privacy theorems applicable to distribution learning.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Geometry of Random Geometric Graphs</title>

Abstract: Random geometric graphs are random graph models defined on metric spaces. Such a model is defined by first sampling points from a metric space and then connecting each pair of sampled points with probability that depends on their distance, independently among pairs. In this work, we show how to efficiently reconstruct the geometry of the underlying space from the sampled graph under the manifold assumption, i.e., assuming that the underlying space is a low dimensional manifold and that the connection probability is a strictly decreasing function of the Euclidean distance between the points in a given embedding of the manifold in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Our work complements a large body of work on manifold learning, where the goal is to recover a manifold from sampled points sampled in the manifold along with their (approximate) distances.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Markovian Operators in Orlicz Spaces and Error Bounds for Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our key technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin's minorisation. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin's interpolation methods. Furthermore, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. As an application of the framework put forward in the paper, we introduce tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes, better exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods, and better lower bounds on the burn-in period. To conclude, we show how our results can be used to prove the concentration of measure phenomenon for a sequence of Markovian random variables.</description>
