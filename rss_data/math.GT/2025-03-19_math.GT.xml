      <title>Data Driven Perspectives on Knot Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data science offers a powerful tool to understand objects in multiple sciences. In this paper we utilize concept of data science, most notably topological data analysis, to extend our understanding of knot theory. This approach provides a way to extend mathematical exposition of various invariants of knots towards understanding their relations in statistical and cumulative way. Paper included examples illustrating how topological data analysis can illuminate structure and relations between knot invariants, state new hypothesis, and gain new insides into long standing conjectures.</description>

      <title>Long-Moody construction of braid group representations and Haraoka's multiplicative middle convolution for KZ-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a correspondence between algebraic and analytic approaches to constructing representations of the braid group $B_n$, namely Katz-Long-Moody construction and multiplicative middle convolution for Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ)-type equations, respectively. By the left action of the braid group $B_n$ on the free group $F_n$, known as the Artin representation, the semidirect product can be defined $F_n \rtimes B_n$. The Long-Moody construction \cite{long1994constructing} provides a method to construct linear representations of $B_n$ from any given representation of $F_n \rtimes B_n$. The Katz-Long-Moody construction generalizes this approach, yielding an infinite sequence of representations of $F_n \rtimes B_n$ \cite{hiroe2023long}. On the other hand, the fundamental group of the domain of the $n$-valued KZ-type equation is isomorphic to the pure braid group $P_n$. The multiplicative middle convolution for the KZ-type equation provides an antirepresentation of $P_n$, derived from a given antirepresentation of $P_n$ \cite{haraoka2020multiplicative}. Furthermore, we show that this construction preserves unitarity relative to a Hermitian matrix $\widetilde{H}_{\widetilde{p}, \widetilde{q}}$, and established an algorithm to determine the signature of the Hermitian matrix $\widetilde{H}_{\widetilde{p}, \widetilde{q}}$.</description>

      <title>Sken and cluster algebras of punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the full Fock-Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,\Sigma_{g,p}}$--the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety associated to representation of $SL_2$ local systems on most punctured surfaces with at least 2 punctures in the classical $q\to 1$ setting, that is, the tagged skein algebra coincides with the upper cluster algebra (namely $Sk^{ta}=U(\Sigma)$ or $mid(\mathcal{A})=up(\mathcal{A})$), with methods being potentially useful to tackle the quantum case. We deduce similar results for the Roger Yang skein algebra via a birational geometric description, obtaining $Sk^{RY}=U(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$ as conjectured by Shen, Sun and Weng, proving important algebraic properties of $Sk^{RY}$ including normality and Cohen-Macaulayness. Our result is complementary to what and Mandel and Qin have shown in arXiv:2301.11101 for surface with marked points, based on arXiv:1411.1394 . The once-punctured case where cluster structures are significantly different is also discussed in the paper, and relevant conjectures are proposed (and proved in the once-punctured torus case).
  By contrast, we define the ordinary cluster algebra with potentials added $A(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$, introduced by Shen, Sun and Weng, which is shown to be usually smaller than $Sk^{RY}$ and $U(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$. This strengthen the result of arXiv:2201.08833 that the classical $A=U$ fails for $\Sigma_{g,p}$ with $g\geq 1, p\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>How Many Links Fit in a Box?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an earlier note [arXiv:2301.00295] it was shown that there is an upper bound to the number of disjoint Hopf links (and certain related links) that can be embedded in the unit cube where there is a fixed separation required between the components within each copy of the Hopf link. The arguments relied on multi-linear properties of linking number and certain other link invariants. Here we produce a very similar upper bound for all non-trivial links by a more-general, entirely geometric, argument (but one which, unlike the original, has no analog in higher dimensions). Shortly after the initial paper, [arXiv:2308.08064] proved lower bounds which still provide a converse to our Theorem 1 in the case that only a bounded number of link types appear among the set $\{L_i\}$ as $N$ increases.</description>

      <title>A diagrammatic approach to the Rasmussen invariant via tangles and cobordisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a diagrammatic approach to Rasmussen's $s$-invariant via tangles and cobordisms, combining Bar-Natan's formulation of Khovanov homology for tangles and cobordisms with the characterization of $s$ via the divisibility of the Lee class, as developed in the author's previous works. This framework enables a "divide-and-conquer" method for computing $s$ from a tangle decomposition of a given knot diagram, making it suitable for both pen-and-paper calculations and algorithmic implementations. As an application, we determine the $s$-invariants of pretzel knots of the form $P(p_1, -p_2, \ldots, -p_l)$, where $l \geq 3$ is odd, all $p_i$ are positive and odd, and $p_1 &lt; \min\{p_2, \ldots, p_l\}$.</description>

      <title>Groups Acting Acylindrically on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12192v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a notion of groups that act acylindrically and non-elementarily on simplicial trees, which we call acylindrically arboreal groups. We then prove a complete classification of when graph products of groups and the fundamental groups of certain hyperbolic $3$-manifolds are acylindrically arboreal, and use these classifications to provide examples of acylindrically hyperbolic groups that have actions on trees but have no non-elementary acylindrical actions on trees.</description>
