      <title>Polarized Deep Inelastic Scattering as $x \to 1$ using Soft Collinear Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) to factorize the polarized Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) structure functions $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$, and to sum Sudakov double logarithms of $1-x$. The analysis is done both in terms of lightcone parton distributions and their moments. Computing $g_2$ requires subleading SCET operators which contain gluons. We calculate the one-loop matching coefficients from QCD onto these subleading SCET operators, and the one-loop matching from SCET onto the parton distribution function (PDF). The PDF in SCET is given by a bilocal operator, rather than the trilocal operator used in the QCD analysis of $g_2$ for generic $x$. We compute the one-loop anomalous dimension of the PDF operator for any $x$, and show that as $x \to 1$, it factors into a single-variable evolution.
  We comment on the QCD anomalous dimensions of twist-three operators, their equation-of-motion relation, and connection to the SCET analysis. We briefly discuss the definition of axial operators in the BMHV scheme. As a side result, we derive the $1/N$ dependence of the QCD coefficient functions for $F_1$, $F_L$ and $g_1$ in the $N \to \infty$ limit, where $N$ is the moment.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Amplification for Muon-to-Positron Conversion in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the lepton-number and lepton-flavour-violating process of muon-to-positron conversion $\mu^- + N \rightarrow e^+ + N'$, in the presence of an ultralight scalar dark matter (ULSDM) field which couples to neutrinos. The ULSDM contributes to the effective off-diagonal Majorana mass $ m_{\mu e}$, therefore amplifying the rate of muon-to-positron conversion to experimentally observable levels. Using existing bounds from SINDRUM II, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, we derive constraints on the flavour-off-diagonal couplings of neutrinos to ULSDM for the first time. Our work reveals that upcoming experiments can provide stronger sensitivity to these new couplings than bounds arising from cosmological surveys and terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Statistics for Dirac and Majorana Neutrinos using Spinor-Helicity techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in the applicability of quantum statistics to distinguish Dirac from Majorana neutrinos in multi-neutrino final states. In particular, debate has arisen over the validity of the Dirac-Majorana confusion theorem in these processes, i.e. that any distinction between the Dirac and Majorana processes goes to zero as the neutrino mass goes to zero. Here we approach this problem equipped with spinor-helicity methods generalized for massive Dirac and Majorana fermions. We explicitly calculate all helicity amplitudes for the decay of a light scalar particle to two neutrinos and two oppositely charged leptons. This allows us to pinpoint the crucial steps which could lead to claims of a violation of the confusion theorem. We show that if the correct anti-symmetrization of Dirac to Majorana amplitudes is used, identification of which is clear in this framework, and all relevant contributions are appropriately summed, a scalar decay into two charged leptons and two neutrinos satisfies the Dirac-Majorana confusion theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of scattering amplitudes and interferences in perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flagship application of quantum computers is the simulation of other quantum systems, including quantum field theories. In this article, we show how quantum computers can be employed to naturally calculate Feynman diagrams and their interferences in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We simulate the colour parts of the interactions directly on the quantum computer, while the kinematic parts are for now pre-computed classically. For processes where some of the external particles are identical, we find the first hints of a potential quantum advantage. We validate our techniques using simulated quantum computers. Furthermore, for toy examples we also demonstrate our algorithms on a 56-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. The work constitutes a further key step towards a full quantum simulation of generic perturbative QCD processes.</description>

      <title>Chiral Cherenkov radiation at time-dependent chiral chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the photon production process $f\to f+\gamma$ in the presence of a time-dependent chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. Using the ultra-relativistic approximation, we demonstrate validity of the adiabatic approximation. Analytical expressions for the photon spectrum are derived for two models of the chiral magnetic conductivity $b_0\propto \mu_5$: (i) $b_0(t)= A_1+B_1\tanh(t/\tau)$ and (ii) $b_0(t)= A_2(t/\tau)/(1+t^2/\tau^2)$. It is known that for constant $b_0$, photon emission may exhibit a resonance for one photon polarization depending on the sign of $b_0$. We show that in model (i), up to two resonances may occur, depending on the sign of the asymptotic values $b_0(\infty)$ and $b_0(-\infty)$. No resonances are observed in model (ii). Numerical calculations are performed using parameters relevant to quark-gluon plasma, and we discuss the universality of the results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Analysis of Transverse Momentum Spectra in Pb-Pb Collisions at 2.76 TeV: Centrality Dependence of Temperature, Freezeout Parameters and Non-Extensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV in mid-rapidity, $|y|&lt;0.5$, based on data by the ALICE Collaboration. In particular, we examine the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of positively charged (identified) hadrons, $\pi^+$, $K^+$ and $p$, generated in various centrality intervals. We perform individual fits using the thermodynamically consistent Tsallis distribution to extract the following quantities: the non-extensitivity parameter, $q$, the effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff}$, the kinetic freezeout volume, $V$, the mean transverse flow velocity, $\beta_T$, the mean kinetic freezeout temperature, $\langle T_0\rangle$, the thermal temperature, $T_{\rm th}$, and the parameter $\zeta$, which characterizes the fluctuating number of generated particles. From peripheral to central collision, and from lower to higher charged particle multiplicity per pseudorapidity unit, $\langle dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta \rangle$, all these quantities are observed to increase, with the exception of $q$, which has the opposite behavior. The parameters $T_{\rm eff}$, $q$, and $V$ depend on the hadron mass in a way that supports the scenarios of volume differential freezeout and multiple kinetic freezeout. Furthermore, we extracted $\langle T_{\rm eff}\rangle$ and $\langle q\rangle$ for different collisions and energies at LHC and RHIC, and compare their dependencies on $\langle dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta \rangle$ and $\langle N_{\rm part} \rangle$.</description>

      <title>LIQUIDating the Gallium Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gallium anomaly has a global significance of greater than $5\sigma$. Most viable BSM solutions quickly run into strong tensions with reactor and solar neutrino data. We propose to use indium (${}^{115}\text{In}$) as a target as it offers a low threshold and reasonably high cross section. The neutrino-indium charged current cross section can be calibrated using the well-constrained solar ${}^{7}\text{Be}$ neutrino flux that lies very close in energy to the ${}^{51}\text{Cr}$ neutrino lines. The triple coincidence provided by ${}^{115}\text{In}$ neutrino capture can be fully exploited by an opaque scintillation detector that also provides energy and position information. We show that a $100$ ton indium target combined with 2 source runs of a $3.4$ MCi ${}^{51}\text{Cr}$ source can probe the complete parameter space of the gallium anomaly, both in the context of a vanilla sterile neutrino as well as more involved BSM scenarios.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of physics capabilities of a liquid argon and a water based liquid scintillator at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparison of the physics sensitivities of a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) and a Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) detector, considering their potential deployment as the fourth far detector module in the DUNE facility. Using GLoBES-based simulations, we evaluate their performance in measuring standard neutrino oscillation parameters ($\theta_{23}, \delta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{31}$), both in standard 3-neutrino case, as well as in presence of new physics scenarios involving light sterile neutrinos and neutral-current non-standard interactions (NC NSI). Our findings show that THEIA (a WbLS-based detector) significantly outperforms LArTPC in resolving the CP phase $\delta_{13}$,- especially near maximal CP violation, and in lifting the octant degeneracy of $\theta_{23}$ due to its superior energy resolution and ability to clearly identify the second oscillation maximum. Furthermore, THEIA offers competitive reconstruction precision even with relatively moderate energy resolutions ($7-10\%/\sqrt{E}$) and demonstrates enhanced robustness under new physics scenarios. These results support the physics-driven case for a hybrid DUNE configuration utilizing both LArTPC and WbLS technologies for optimized sensitivity across the full spectrum of neutrino oscillation and physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Probing Axions via Spectroscopic Measurements of S-stars at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions, encompassing both QCD axions and axion-like particles, can generate loop-induced quadratic couplings to electromagnetic field strength tensors, resulting in oscillatory shifts of the fine-structure constant. Near a Kerr black hole, an axion field with a Compton wavelength comparable to the event horizon can exponentially grow through the superradiance mechanism, potentially reaching a maximum amplitude near the decay constant, provided this scale is below approximately $10^{16}$ GeV. The saturated axion cloud formed around the black hole induces characteristic oscillations in the fine-structure constant, with a period of $10$-$40$ minutes determined by the axion mass, and a spatial profile governed by the axion wavefunction and its coupling strength. At lower axion masses, axion dark matter can form a soliton-like core characterized by a nearly constant amplitude, extending measurable variations of the fine-structure constant to greater distances. Precise spectroscopic measurements of S-stars orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^*$ provide a powerful probe of these predictions, potentially excluding substantial regions of parameter space for quadratic scalar couplings to photons, owing to the high boson density near the Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>The Electromagnetic Form Factors of Pseudoscalar Mesons within the Light-Front Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) and charge radii of pseudoscalar mesons within the light-front quark model (LFQM). Using parameters derived from the confinement of mesonic decay constants, we obtain numerical results, which indicate the following: (i) The EMFFs of charged and neutral mesons exhibit significant differences in their endpoint behaviors but show similar asymptotic behavior in the high momentum transfer ($Q^2$) regions. For the EMFFs of light mesons such as $\pi$ and $K^+$, our results are in excellent agreement with experimental data in the low $Q^2$ regions. For the charge radii of mesons, our results also show rough consistency with predictions from other approaches. (ii) For charged mesons, the peak values of $Q^2 F_P(Q^2)$ are approximately proportional to the mass difference $\Delta m$ between their constituent quarks. Moreover, the mean square radii $\left\langle r^2 \right\rangle_P$ of charged mesons decrease with increasing meson mass and decreasing $\Delta m$. For neutral mesons, their charge radii are primarily determined by the electric charge of the heavy quark. These results indicate that quark mass asymmetry significantly influences the behavior of the EMFFs and charge radii of mesons. Experimental data to test these predictions would thus be of great interest.</description>

      <title>Learning Pole Structures of Hadronic States using Predictive Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\%$ while discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure inference in scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a universal QCD-motivated expression for the Polyakov-KNO multiplicity distributions of hadrons in jets and compare it with data from $e^+e^-$ annihilation experiments. The moments and overall shape of the distributions in full events and quark and gluon jets, over a range of energies, are described with reasonable quantitative precision. In particular, the scaling violation predicted by QCD is seen clearly in the moments and high-multiplicity fluctuations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electroproduction of kaon on proton has been studied using two covariant isobar models. The models incorporate propagators and vertex factors developed in our previous works. In total, the current study includes 26 nucleon resonances and 20 hyperon resonances, with spins up to 13/2. In the electromagnetic vertices, we consider two alternative electromagnetic form factors alongside the commonly used dipole model. The unknown parameters in the models, such as longitudinal coupling constants and form factor cutoffs, are determined by fitting the calculated observables to nearly 2000 experimental data points. The resulting models demonstrate satisfactory consistency with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Entropy production at electroweak bubble walls from scalar field fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time dynamics of an electroweak phase transition involves large time and distance scales, the domain of hydrodynamics. However, the matching conditions of ideal hydrodynamics across a bubble wall do not fix the fluid profile completely, with the remaining degree of freedom parametrizable through entropy production. Within a framework of Langevin dynamics, viewed as an effective description valid between the hydrodynamic ($k \sim g^4_{ } T/\pi^3_{ }$) and soft momentum scales ($k \sim gT$), we determine the entropy production originating from scalar field fluctuations. The entropy discontinuity is shown to remain non-vanishing when the friction coefficient is sent to zero, in apparent violation of the ``local thermal equilibrium'' (LTE) framework. To confirm the finding, we identify its origin within Boltzmann equations, as being part of the $1\to 1$ force associated with the ``ballistic'' regime. The result implies that LTE-based upper bounds on the wall velocity cannot be saturated.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Axion-Like Particles from 16.5 Years of Fermi-LAT Data and Prospects for VLAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical particles beyond the Standard Model, are considered as promising dark matter candidates. ALPs can convert into photons and vice versa in a magnetic field via the Primakoff effect, potentially generating detectable oscillation in $\gamma$-ray spectra. This study analyzes 16.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) on NGC 1275, the brightest galaxy in the Perseus cluster, to constrain the ALP parameter space. Our results improve the previous 95\% exclusion limits of the photon-ALP coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ by a factor of 2 in the ALP mass range of $4\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Moreover, we investigate the projected sensitivity of the future Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) on searching for ALPs. We find that (i) the expected sensitivity on the ALP-photon coupling can be stronger than that from the upcoming International Axion Observatory (IAXO) in the ALP mass range of $2\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 1\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the best sensitivity of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 7\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ at $m_{a}\sim 2\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}$; (ii) VLAST can extend the sensitivity of the ALP masses below $5\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$, where the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim 1.5\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ will be excluded; (iii) the entire parameter space of ALP accounting for TeV transparency can be fully tested. These results demonstrate that VLAST will offer an excellent opportunity for ALPs searches.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy of $DN$ and $\bar{D}N$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability of the ALICE@LHC and STAR@RHIC experiments to reconstruct $D$ mesons has enabled femtoscopic correlation measurements of open-charm mesons in both small and large systems. In this work, we present a theoretical calculation of the correlation functions of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons with nucleons, based on the Koonin-Pratt formalism applied to the systems produced in these high-energy collisions. We use an effective Lagrangian that models the interaction between charmed mesons and baryons. From the unitarized on-shell amplitudes, we extract the low-energy scattering parameters and compute the correlation functions using the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation. Additionally, we apply the TROY formalism to obtain the off-shell $T$-matrix in coupled channels and reconstruct the full wave function, which we incorporate into the Koonin-Pratt formula. We compare these two approaches and provide predictions for different correlated pairs, including the effects of the Coulomb interaction and thermal weights for the coupled channels. These results can be tested against current and future experimental data from ALICE and STAR collaborations in both proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Monophotons from Scalar Portal Dark Matter at Neutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate monophoton signatures arising from dark matter via a $2\to 3$ scattering process $\chi + N \to \chi + N + \gamma$ that is mediated by a virtual scalar and a Standard Model photon. Since the final-state photon carries a large fraction of the initial dark matter's energy, this process offers a compelling handle for probing scalar portal dark matter scenarios. Their distinctive energy, angular, and timing distributions allow for effective separation of signal from neutrino-induced backgrounds. We analyze several models featuring different couplings to the scalar mediator, with the scalar photon coupling serving as the common detection channel. We considered the flux of dark matter produced both at the target and absorber of neutrino facilities such as the BNB, NuMI, and LBNF, and investigated the sensitivities at the ongoing SBND, ICARUS-NuMI, and future DUNE ND detectors. Our results demonstrate that the sensitivities at the considered experiments, especially DUNE ND, can place significantly improved constraints on viable parameter space in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic Contributions in GMSB with Adjoint Messengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking, in which the breaking is transmitted to the visible sector by the messenger fields from the adjoint representation of MSSM's gauge group. We include the non-holomorphic terms induced by the supersymmetry breaking and involve them in the renormalization group evolution. The main impact from the non-holomorphic terms arises in the right-handed stau mass, which requires large hypercharge interactions with the messengers to accommodate non-tachyonic staus. With the non-holomorphic terms, the stau mass-square can remain positive in the renormalization group evolution, even if the hypercharge interactions are small. Although the radiative non-holomorphic contributions enhance the mass spectrum, their effects in the sparticle mixing rather reduce their overall contributions such that we realize about 25 GeV difference in the right-handed stau mass, while the difference is lowered by about 5 TeV in the lightest mass-eigenstate of staus. We realize 6-7 TeV difference in the sbottom mass, and about 15 TeV in the stop mass. These contributions in the sparticle masses also affect the SM-like Higgs boson mass, and we find that the SM-like Higgs boson can be enhanced as much as about 80 GeV. In a small region of the parameter space we also observe negative non-holomorphic contributions which do not exceed about 1 TeV for the sparticles, and 20 GeV for the SM-like Higgs boson. An interesting impact from the non-holomorphic terms happens in the muon g-2 results. We find that the non-holomorphic contributions can provide a significant decreasing in supersymmetric contributions to muon g-2. We realize that the muon g-2 results can be decreased as much as about -50 x 10^-10 by the non-holomorphic contributions, and consequently one can still accommodate light sleptons and gauginos in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Multiple Axions Save High-Scale Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many models of dark matter QCD axion requires inflation at a scale $H_{\text{inf}} \lesssim 10^{6}$~GeV and hence does not allow for a detectable tensor mode fluctuation. This is because the domain wall problem forces the Peccei--Quinn symmetry to be broken during the inflation and the axions to be produced by the misalignment mechanism. We point out that theories with multiple axions can evade this constraint and allow for a high-scale inflation with detectable tensor mode. It only requires a condition on the anomaly coefficients so that there is a unique minimum for the axion potential without a fine-tuning or small parameters.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Materials for Light Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots from Small-Scale Primordial Black Hole Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of $10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Hybrid Mode Cavity for Heterodyne Axion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the heterodyne approach to axion detection, axion dark matter induces transitions between two modes of a microwave cavity, resulting in a parametrically enhanced signal power. We describe the fabrication and characterization of a prototype normal conducting cavity specifically optimized for heterodyne detection. Corrugations on the cavity walls support linearly polarized hybrid modes which maximize the signal power while strongly suppressing noise. We demonstrate tuning mechanisms which allow one mode's frequency to be scanned across a 4 MHz range, while suppressing cross-coupling noise by at least 80 dB. A future superconducting cavity with identical geometry to our prototype would have the potential to probe orders of magnitude beyond astrophysical bounds.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favor a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a class of thawing scalar field models propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the Om diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>

      <title>20 GeV halo-like excess of the Galactic diffuse emission and implications for dark matter annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60$ deg, $10 \le |b| \le 60$ deg) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a sharp peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which does not depend on GALPROP or other model templates. The halo excess can be fitted by the annihilation spectrum with a mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring non-cold dark matter in a scenario of dynamical dark energy with DESI DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of DESI hint that dark matter (DM) may not be cold but have a non-zero equation of state (EoS) parameter, and that dark energy (DE) may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform analysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of CMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS parameter at the $2.8\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ level within the content of a constant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$. Furthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and Bayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a non-zero DM EoS parameter warrants further exploration and investigation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Uncertainties on the Z Boson Background in the Context of High Precision W Boson Mass Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise determination of the $W$ boson mass, $m_W$, is a cornerstone of electroweak precision tests and a critical input to global fits of the Standard Model (SM). While most existing measurements of $m_W$ are in agreement with SM predictions, the recent result from the CDF collaboration exhibits a significant deviation from the SM prediction but also exceeding $4\sigma$ from the global average of all other high precision measurements. This prompts renewed scrutiny of potential sources of systematic bias. In this study, we investigate the modeling of the $Z$ boson background, which is particularly relevant in the muon decay channel of the $W$ boson, where undetected muons can mimic missing transverse momentum. Using updated theoretical predictions and high-precision simulations, we construct reweighted templates to evaluate the impact of possible mismodeling in the $Z$ background. Our analysis suggests that such effects can induce a shift in the extracted $m_W$ value of up to 8~MeV in the muon decay channel. While this shift is non-negligible and exceeds the originally quoted uncertainty from this source, it remains insufficient to explain the full discrepancy observed in the CDF measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale primordial perturbations have been well constrained by current cosmological observations, but the properties of small-scale perturbations remain elusive. This study focuses on second-order tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves (TSIGWs) generated by large-amplitude primordial scalar and tensor perturbations on small scales. We provide the analytical expressions for the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of SGWB across different scales, TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of TSIGWs dominating the current PTA observations under various primordial power spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA observations.</description>

      <title>A case study of GW190425 for classifying binary neutron star versus binary black hole mergers and constraining asymmetric dark matter with gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO Scientific, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration has identified two binary neutron star merger candidates, GW170817 and GW190425, along with several binary black hole candidates. While GW170817 was confirmed as a BNS merger through its electromagnetic counterparts, GW190425 lacked such observations, leaving its classification uncertain. We examine the possibility that GW190425 originated from black holes that merged after dark matter accretion caused their progenitor neutron stars to implode. Using this event, we place constraints on dark matter parameters, such as its mass and interaction cross section. We simulate GW190425-like events and analyze them using future gravitational wave detector networks, including upcoming upgrades to current detector networks and next-generation observatories. We show that a network with A+ sensitivity can not classify a GW190425-like event with sufficient confidence. Detector networks with A# sensitivity can classify such events only if the neutron stars follow a relatively stiff equation of state, whose stronger tidal imprint differs measurably from a binary black hole waveform. Next-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer recover the tidal signature even for soft, compact stars, enabling confident classification. Finally, we forecast the dark matter constraints that future gravitational wave networks could achieve for similar events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.12742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We renormalize massless scalar effective field theories (EFTs) to higher loop orders and higher orders in the EFT expansion. To facilitate EFT calculations with the R* renormalization method, we construct suitable operator bases using Hilbert series and related ideas in commutative algebra and conformal representation theory, including their novel application to off-shell correlation functions. We obtain new results ranging from full one loop at mass dimension twelve to five loops at mass dimension six. We explore the structure of the anomalous dimension matrix with an emphasis on its zeros, and investigate the effects of conformal and orthonormal operators. For the real scalar, the zeros can be explained by a `non-renormalization' rule recently derived by Bern et al. For the complex scalar we find two new selection rules for mixing $n$- and $(n-2)$-field operators, with $n$ the maximal number of fields at a fixed mass dimension. The first appears only when the $(n-2)$-field operator is conformal primary, and is valid at one loop. The second appears in more generic bases, and is valid at three loops. Finally, we comment on how the Hilbert series we construct may be used to provide a systematic enumeration of a class of evanescent operators that appear at a particular mass dimension in the scalar EFT.</description>

      <title>Testing CP-violation in a Heavy Higgs Sector at CLIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to probe CP-violation in the heavy (pseudo)scalar sector of an extended Higgs model, in which we make simultaneous use of the $HVV$ ($V=W^\pm, Z$) and $Ht\bar{t}$ interactions of a heavy Higgs state $H$. The CP-even component of $H$ can be probed through the tree level $HVV$ interaction while the CP-odd component of $H$ can be probed if the final $t\bar{t}$ pair can be tested to form a $^1S_0$ state. We can then confirm CP-violation if both CP-even and CP-odd components of $H$ are discovered. This is possible at the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) by exploiting $H$ production from Vector-Boson Fusion (VBF) and decay to $t\bar{t}$ pairs. We analyze the distribution of the azimuthal angle between the leptons coming from top and antitop quarks, that would allow one to disentangle the CP nature of such a heavy Higgs state. We also show its implications for the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with CP-violation.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications to jet angularities using SCET with Glauber gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of medium modifications on ungroomed jet angularities, $\tau_a$, within the framework of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory with Glauber gluons (SCET$_{\rm G}$). Angularities are a one-parameter family of jet substructure observables with angularity exponent $a &lt; 2$ for infrared safety. Variation of the angularity exponent allows one to modify the relative weighting of the collinear-to-soft radiations in the jet, thereby giving access to different moments of the jet transverse momentum spectrum. In this article, we focus on $a&lt;1$ and provide detailed results for $a=-1, 0$, and $0.5$. Within SCET$_{\rm G}$, the interactions between jet and medium constituents are mediated by off-shell Glauber gluons generated from the color sources in the medium. While medium modifications are incorporated into the jet function via the use of medium-induced splitting functions, the soft function remains unmodified for $a&lt;1$. For all values of $a$, we find that compared to jets in vacuum, the medium-modified distributions are shifted towards smaller values of jet angularity and have a steeper fall. This redistribution of the ungroomed angularity spectrum is more apparent for a jet with a larger cone size and for higher values of $a$. We also present results for the medium sensitivity towards $p_T$ of the jet and for a jet initiated in a less central event ($10-30\%$ centrality). Finally, we provide the ratios of nucleus-nucleus and proton-proton differential angularity distributions for different angularity exponents, and for two values of the jet radius parameter.</description>

      <title>Axionic defects in the CMB: birefringence and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evidence for a non-vanishing isotropic cosmic birefringence in recent analyses of the CMB data provides a tantalizing hint for new physics. Domain wall (DW) networks have recently been shown to generate an isotropic birefringence signal in the ballpark of the measured value when coupled to photons. In this work, we explore the axionic defects hypothesis in more detail and extending previous results to annihilating and late-forming networks, and by pointing out other smoking-gun signatures of the network in the CMB spectrum such as the anisotropic birefringent spectrum and B-modes. We also argue that the presence of cosmic strings in the network does not hinder a large isotropic birefringence signal because of an intrinsic environmental contribution coming from low redshifts thus leaving open the possibility that axionic defects can explain the signal. Regarding the remaining CMB signatures, with the help of dedicated 3D numerical simulations of DW networks, that we took as a proxy for the axionic defects, we show how the anisotropic birefringence spectrum combined with a tomographic approach can be used to infer the formation and annihilation time of the network. From the numerical simulations, we also computed the spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by the network in the post-recombination epoch and use previous searches for stochastic GW backgrounds in the CMB to derive for the first time a bound on the tension and abundance of networks with DWs that annihilate after recombination. Our bounds extend to the case where the network survives until the present time and improve over previous bounds by roughly one order of magnitude. Finally, we show the interesting prospects for detecting B-modes of DW origin with future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Searching for ultra-light dark matter through frequency modulation of gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-light bosons, naturally appearing in well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model, can constitute all the dark matter. Models with particle mass close to the smallest phenomenologically allowed exhibit coherent field configurations at (sub)galactic scales, oscillating at a frequency corresponding to the fundamental mass of the dark matter particle. The gravitational field of these structures inherits the dark matter field's coherent oscillations, leaving an imprint on gravitational (and electromagnetic) waves sourced close to (or in) such overdensities. This happens via a heterodyning frequency modulation, which can later be decoded in a gravitational-wave detector. An analogous effect occurs in models with universal (conformal) couplings of ultra-light bosons with ordinary matter, generated by the direct interaction with the oscillating field. In this work, we explore this phenomenon in detail and assess the capability of near-future interferometers to probe ultra-light dark matter and its potential conformal couplings to matter. Using astrophysical population models, together with results from cosmological simulations, we find that the observation of gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars at the Galactic Centre with the Einstein Telescope/Cosmic Explorer would be particularly effective in constraining ultra-light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Internal Pair Production -- A Novel Direct Detection Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism, dark matter internal pair production (DIPP), to detect dark matter candidates at beam dump facilities. When energetic dark matter scatters in a material, it can create a lepton-antilepton pair by exchanging a virtual photon with the nucleus, similar to the neutrino trident process. We demonstrate this process for dark matter coupled to dark photons in experiments such as DarkQuest, SBND, and DUNE ND experiments. Since the pair-produced lepton-antilepton pair carries a large fraction of the center-of-mass energy and also has similar energy profiles, they can be clearly distinguished from backgrounds. We utilize the above features to show that DIPP is effective in probing various dark matter models, especially at DUNE ND and DarkQuest, by looking for electron-positron and muon-antimuon signatures. We also consider a scenario with dark sector couplings to quarks and muons only to show that DIPP can probe a wide range of dark matter models with various final states.</description>

      <title>Double parton distributions of the proton from basis light-front quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the basis light-front quantization framework, we systematically investigate the unpolarized and longitudinally polarized double parton distributions (DPDs) of quarks inside the proton. We utilize the light-front wave functions of the proton derived in the valence sector from a Hamiltonian quantized on the light-front. The interaction terms of the Hamiltonian consist of a one-gluon exchange interaction at fixed coupling and a three-dimensional confinement potential. Our current analysis yields significant correlations of the quarks' longitudinal momenta with their transverse separation. We also demonstrate that our calculations do not support the commonly used $x-\vec{k}_\perp$ factorization of the DPDs in $x$ and $k_\perp$. Our results are qualitatively consistent with those of other phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>A 95 GeV Higgs Boson in the $U(1)_X$SSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13261v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CMS and ATLAS Collaborations have recently reported their findings based on the comprehensive run 2 dataset, detailing their searches for a light Higgs boson with a mass of approximately 95 GeV. We investigate the excesses observed in the $\gamma\gamma$ and $b{\bar b}$ data at approximately 95 GeV in the $U(1)_X$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ($U(1)_X$SSM). Additionally, it also mixes with the SM-like Higgs boson. Research indicates that, in this model, identifying the mixture of the singlet Higgs states as the lightest Higgs boson holds tremendous potential for explaining the excess observed at approximately 95 GeV. In our calculations, we maintain the masses of the lightest and next-to-lightest Higgs bosons at approximately 95 GeV and 125 GeV, respectively. The study finds that the theoretical predictions for the signal strengths $\mu(h_{95})_{\gamma\gamma}$ and $\mu(h_{95})_{b{\bar b}}$ in the $U(1)_X$SSM align well with the excesses observed by CMS.</description>

      <title>Sensitivities to New Resonance Couplings to $W$-Bosons at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a search strategy at the HL-LHC for a new neutral particle $X$ that couples to $W$-bosons, using the process $p p \rightarrow W^{\pm} X (\rightarrow W^{+} W^{-})$ with a tri-$W$-boson final state. Focusing on events with two same-sign leptonic $W$-boson decays into muons and a hadronically decaying $W$-boson, our method leverages the enhanced signal-to-background discrimination achieved through a machine-learning-based multivariate analysis. Using the heavy photophobic axion-like particle (ALP) as a benchmark, we evaluate the discovery sensitivities on both production cross section times branching ratio $\sigma(p p \rightarrow W^{\pm} X) \times \textrm{Br}(X \rightarrow W^{+} W^{-})$ and the coupling $g_{aWW}$ for the particle mass over a wide range of 170-3000 GeV at the HL-LHC with center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV and integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L} = 3$ $\textrm{ab}^{-1}$. Our results show significant improvements in discovery sensitivity, particularly for masses above 300 GeV, compared to existing limits derived from CMS analyses of Standard Model (SM) tri-$W$-boson production at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. This study demonstrates the potential of advanced selection techniques in probing the coupling of new particles to $W$-bosons and highlights the HL-LHC's capability to explore the physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Giving wake to energy-energy correlators: Hydrodynamic response on the celestial sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of the medium response generated by the propagation of high energy partons in the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions would provide a clear and unmistakable evidence for the hydrodynamic behavior of the bulk. Recently, it has been argued that the features of the medium's back-reaction to the jet could be cleanly imprinted in the correlations of asymptotic energy flows, in principle allowing to isolate this signal from other uncorrelated physical processes. Nonetheless, the current limited theoretical understanding of these jet observables in heavy-ion collisions constrains their applicability as probes of the medium (hydro)dynamics. In this work, we provide an analytic picture for the medium back-reaction's effect on the energy flux and two point energy correlator. We show that the medium response leads to the emergence of an universal classical scaling law, competing with the perturbative QCD contribution at large angles. Comparing the associated correlator to recent experimental measurements, we find that the observed large angle features can be qualitatively described by a purely hydrodynamically driven response and its interplay with the hard jet component.</description>

      <title>Dirt/Detector/Dump: Complementary BSM production at Short-Baseline Neutrino Facilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-baseline neutrino (SBN) facilities are optimal for new-physics searches, including the possible production of new particles in and along the neutrino beamline. One such class of models considers states that are created by neutrino upscattering that then decay in the neutrino detector -- in the past, such upscattering has often been considered to occur in the detector itself (with a prompt decay) or in the dirt upstream of the detector. In this work, we highlight the importance of the beam dumps, situated even further upstream, for such searches. The Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam, with its iron dump, provides one such possibility. We focus on sub-GeV heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) with a transition magnetic moment, which allows this upscattering to take advantage of the high-$Z$ iron. We observe that, in addition to increased sensitivity to this model at SBND, MicroBooNE, and ICARUS, there exist distinct features in the signal events' kinematical properties when coming from production in the dump, dirt, and detector which can allow for enhanced signal-to-background separation. We highlight the complementarity of this approach to study parameter space relevant for the MiniBooNE low-energy excess, as well as in models in which the HNLs couple to a light scalar particle.</description>

Abstract: CubeSat technology is an emerging alternative to large-scale space telescopes due to its short development time and cost-effectiveness. MeVCube is a proposed CubeSat mission to study the least explored MeV gamma-ray sky, also known as the `MeV gap'. Besides being sensitive to a plethora of astrophysical phenomena, MeVCube can also be important in the hunt for dark matter. If dark matter is made up of evaporating primordial black holes, then it can produce photons in the sensitivity range of MeVCube. Besides, particle dark matter can also decay or annihilate to produce final state gamma-ray photons. We perform the first comprehensive study of dark matter discovery potential of a near-future MeVCube CubeSat mission. In all cases, we find that MeVCube will have much better discovery reach compared to existing limits in the parameter space. This may be an important step towards discovering dark matter through its non-gravitational interactions.</description>

Abstract: Soft-gluon resolution scales characterize parton branching Monte Carlo implementations of the evolution equations for parton distribution functions in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We examine scenarios with dynamical, i.e., branching-scale dependent, resolution scale, and discuss physical implications for both collinear and transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) distributions. We perform the first determination of parton distributions with dynamical resolution scale, at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbation theory, from fits to precision deep-inelastic scattering measurements from HERA. We present an application of TMD distributions with dynamical resolution scale to Drell-Yan lepton-pair transverse momentum spectra at the LHC, and comment on the extraction of non-perturbative intrinsic-kT parameters from Drell-Yan data at small transverse momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the four-body heavy baryon decay, including two leptons in the final state, of the form $B_A \to B_B P \ell_\alpha \ell_\beta$, which can be either a lepton number conserving (LNC) or a lepton number violating (LNV) process (where $B$, $P$ and $\ell$ are baryons, pseudoscalar mesons and leptons, respectively), including all kinematic allowed lepton pair possibilities. We work beyond the simplified assumption of a single heavy Majorana neutrino mixing with the active sector, considering potential interference effects when including two nearly degenerate heavy Majorana neutrinos. Particularly, we provide a first estimate of the decay channels involving different flavors for the external leptons (e.g., muon-tau), and elaborate on the interference pattern due to leptons exchange. We show that the results for the two heavy almost degenerate neutrinos can be recast into a single Majorana neutrino, and exhibit the features for both the LNC and LNV scenarios. We determine the potential exclusion region for the mass and heavy-light mixing parameters, of the neutrinos driving the decay, including finite size detector effects, and compare them with those from direct searches and $\tau$ and meson decays. We also obtain the Branching ratio as a function of the heavy neutrino mass for the current upper limit of the heavy-light mixings.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic moments, magnetic form factors, and transition magnetic form factors of doubly charmed baryons are studied within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. We regulate the loop integrals using the finite-range regularization. The contributions of vector mesons are taken into account to investigate the dependence of form factors on the transferred momentum. The finite volume and lattice spacing effects are considered to analyze the lattice QCD simulations which can be understood well in our framework.</description>

      <title>The Simplest Dark Matter Model at the Edge of Perturbativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasingly sensitive direct detection dark matter experiments are testing important regions of parameter space for WIMP dark matter and pushing many models to the multi-TeV regime. This brings into question the perturbativity of these models. In this context, and in light of the new limits from the LZ experiment, we investigate the status of the simplest thermal dark matter model: a singlet scalar, real or complex, coupled to the Higgs boson. We calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the direct detection rates as well as for the annihilations driving thermal freeze-out. For the complex case, we find that the entire perturbative region is excluded by direct detection. For the real case we find that the mass should be $\gtrsim 20\,{\rm TeV}$ at NLO, compared with the $\gtrsim 30\,{\rm TeV}$ LO limit. We highlight that a three-fold improvement on WIMP spin independent interactions can fully test the real scalar model in the perturbative regime. Finally, for both models, there is still an allowed (albeit narrow) region near the Higgs resonance where couplings are perturbative.</description>

      <title>Role of $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ baryons in $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on Belle data, the structure around 1435 MeV and the role of the $\Sigma(1380)$ resonance in the decay process $\Lambda_c \to \Lambda \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^+$ are investigated. The $\Lambda \pi^\pm$ invariant mass spectra are approximately reproduced by the contribution from the $\Sigma(1385)$, modeled as a Breit-Wigner resonance combined with background. However, an additional contribution is required to account for the pronounced enhancement near 1435 MeV. To describe this structure, two scenarios are considered for the $\Sigma(1435)$: one as a Breit-Wigner resonance with spin-parity $1/2^-$ described via effective Lagrangians, and the other as a rescattering effect arising from coupled-channel interactions. Specifically, the channels $\bar{K}^0p$, $\pi^0\Sigma^+$, $\pi^+\Sigma^0$, $\pi^+\Lambda$, and $\eta\Sigma^+$ are included for the positively charged mode, and $K^-n$, $\pi^0\Sigma^-$, $\pi^-\Sigma^0$, $\pi^-\Lambda$, and $\eta\Sigma^-$ for the negatively charged mode. The rescattering contributions are evaluated using the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. Simulated invariant mass spectra are generated and fitted to the experimental data. Both the Breit-Wigner and rescattering mechanisms provide reasonable descriptions of the enhancement near 1435 MeV. The rescattering approach naturally generates a cusp-like structure near threshold, which closely resembles the feature observed in the data. Furthermore, the inclusion of the $\Sigma(1380)$ resonance with spin-parity $1/2^-$ significantly improves the fit in the low-energy region and further enhances the description near 1435 MeV through interference effects. These results underscore the essential roles of the two $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ states in accurately describing the invariant mass distributions in the decay $\Lambda_c \to \Lambda \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an extensive analysis of the light CP-even Higgs boson pole mass in the MSSM and its dependencies on various parameters based on the 3-loop Flexible-EFTHiggs hybrid calculation which is implemented and publicly avaiable since recently in FlexibleSUSY. Our focus lies on the study of the robustness of the approach in scenarios of highly non-degenerate SUSY mass spectra. Also, we present an improved Higgs mass calculation in the NMSSM based on the same approach, which is published in the new version 2.9.0 of FlexibleSUSY as well. The calculation provides a treatment in the full-model parametrization, leading to an advantageous resummation of QCD-enhanced terms in the stop-mixing parameter and includes important 2-loop contributions as well as 3-loop QCD contributions in the MSSM limit. We assess the reliability of this new calculation by applying it to several distinct NMSSM scenarios. In this context, special attention is devoted to the estimation of NMSSM-specific theory uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Significance of soft-scale breaking on primordial black hole production in Coleman-Weinberg type supercooling-phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-supercooling phase transitions can generate large overdensities in the Universe, potentially leading to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs), which can also be a dark matter candidate. In this work, we focus on the supercooling phase transition for the scale symmetry breaking based on the effective potential of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type. We investigate the effect on the PBH production in the presence of an additional mass term for the CW scalar field, what we call a soft-scale breaking term, which serves as the extra explicit-scale breaking term other than the quantum scale anomaly induced by the CW mechanism. We demonstrate that even a small size of the soft-scale breaking term can significantly affect the PBH production depending on its sign: a positive term slows down the phase transition, thereby enhancing the PBH abundance and improving the model's ability to account for dark matter; in contrast, a negative term suppresses the PBH formation. The inclusion of such soft-scale breaking terms broadens the viable parameter space and increases the flexibility of the framework. We further illustrate our results through two ultraviolet-complete realizations: i) a many-flavor QCD-inspired model as a reference model which can dynamically induce a positive-soft scale breaking; ii) a Higgs portal model with a $B-L$ scalar as the benchmark for the case where a negative-soft scale breaking is induced. Our study would provide a new testable link between PBH dark matter and gravitational wave signatures in the CW-type scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a `QCD dilaton' field, whose vacuum expectation value sets the strong coupling, can render the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) confinement transition first-order. The QCD dilaton is cosmologically attracted to a false vacuum at weak coupling in the early universe. Quantum tunnelling towards the true vacuum triggers prompt chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of QCD, leading to detonating bubbles of the hadronic phase. We find that plasma sound waves produced by this dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition generate a stochastic gravitational wave signal strikingly similar to the recently detected gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Arrays. We briefly comment on how this theory can be probed through collider experiments and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Numerical Challenges in Modeling Gravothermal Collapse in Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When dark matter has a large cross section for self scattering, halos can undergo a process known as gravothermal core collapse, where the inner core rapidly increases in density and temperature. To date, several methods have been used to implement Self-Interacting Dark Matter~(SIDM) in N-body codes, but there has been no systematic study of these different methods or their accuracy in the core-collapse phase. In this paper, we compare three different numerical implementations of SIDM, including the standard methods from the GIZMO and Arepo codes, by simulating idealized dwarf halos undergoing significant dark matter self interactions ($\sigma/m = 50$~cm$^2$/g). When simulating these halos, we also vary the mass resolution, time-stepping criteria, and gravitational force-softening scheme. The various SIDM methods lead to distinct differences in a halo's evolution during the core-collapse phase, as each results in spurious scattering rate differences and energy gains/losses. The use of adaptive force softening for gravity can lead to numerical heating that artificially accelerates core collapse, while an insufficiently small simulation time step can cause core evolution to stall or completely reverse. Additionally, particle numbers must be large enough to ensure that the simulated halos are not sensitive to noise in the initial conditions. Even for the highest-resolution simulations tested in this study ($10^6$ particles per halo), we find that variations of order $10\%$ in collapse time are still present. The results of this work underscore the sensitivity of SIDM modeling on the choice of numerical implementation and motivate a careful study of how these results generalize to halos in a cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation, also know as $E$-model, in the light of current CMB and LSS observations. The inflaton potential in the Einstein frame for this model contains a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential, which alters the predictions for the scalar and tensor power spectra of Starobinsky inflation. We obtain these power spectra numerically without using slow-roll approximation and perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on parameters $M$ and $\alpha$ from Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We consider general reheating scenario by varying the number of e-foldings during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, along with the other parameters. We find $\log_{10}\alpha = 0.0^{+1.6}_{-5.6}$, $\log_{10}M= -4.91^{+0.69}_{-2.7}$ and $N_{pivot} = 53.2^{+3.9}_{-5}$ with $95\%$ C. L.. This implies that the present CMB and LSS observations are insufficient to constrain the parameter $\alpha$. We also find that there is no correlation between $N_{pivot}$ and $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a proton with a deuteron is the simplest nuclear reaction. However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron.</description>

      <title>Search for exotic gravitational wave signals beyond general relativity using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves by LIGO has confirmed general relativity (GR) and sparked rapid growth in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, subtle post-Newtonian (PN) deviations observed during the analysis of high signal-to-noise ratio events from the observational runs suggest that standard waveform templates, which assume strict adherence to GR, might overlook signals from alternative theories of gravity. Incorporating these exotic signals into traditional search algorithms is computationally infeasible due to the vast template space required. This paper introduces a proof-of-principle deep learning framework for detecting exotic GW signals, leveraging neural networks trained on GR-based templates. Through their generalization ability, neural networks learn intricate features from the data, enabling the detection of signals that deviate from GR. We present the first study evaluating the capability of deep learning to detect beyond-GR signals, including a variety of PN orders. Our model achieves rapid and accurate identification of exotic GW signals across different luminosity distances, with performance comparable to GR-based detections. In particular, applying the model to the GW150914 event demonstrates excellent performance, highlighting the potential of AI-driven methods for detecting previously overlooked signals beyond GR. This work paves the way for new discoveries in gravitational wave astronomy, enabling the detection of signals that might escape traditional search pipelines.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation via Inverted Bubble Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation through inverted bubble collapse. In this scenario, bubbles nucleate sparsely in an incomplete first-order phase transition, such that they remain isolated and do not percolate or collide with each other due to the extremely low nucleation rate. This is followed by a bulk phase transition in the rest of the universe that inverts these pre-existing bubbles into false vacuum regions. These spherically symmetric false-vacuum bubbles subsequently collapse to form PBHs. Unlike conventional PBH formation mechanisms associated with domain wall collapse or bubble coalescence, our inverted bubble collapse mechanism naturally ensures spherical collapse. We demonstrate that, when applied to the singlet extension of the Standard Model, this mechanism can produce highly monochromatic PBHs with masses up to ${\cal O}(10^{-7}\,\text{-}\,10^{-5}) M_\odot$, which potentially explain the microlensing events observed in the OGLE and Subaru HSC data.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from the first-order phase transition can be characterized by a few phenomenological parameters but with high degeneracies in model/data distinguishments. In this paper, we look into the high-frequency power law of the GW spectrum with preliminary numerical simulations for both quantum and semi-classical pictures of vacuum decay. We first reveal an anti-correlation of the high-frequency power law to a certain power of the ratio between the wall thickness and bubble radius at the onset of bubble collisions, which can be further approximated analytically by some other phenomenological model characteristics to break the model degeneracy.</description>

Abstract: Based on the model of three-fluid dynamics (3FD), the global $\Lambda$ polarization ($P_\Lambda$) is calculated in Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq$ 9 GeV, in which high baryon density is achieved. Various contributions to $P_\Lambda$ are considered: those from the thermal vorticity, meson field, thermal shear and spin-Hall effect. Feed-down from higher-lying resonances is also taken into account. The results are compared with available data. Special attention is payed to the collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV, for which a thorough scan of the energy, rapidity, and centrality dependence of $P_\Lambda$ is performed. The results for 3 GeV reasonably well reproduce the corresponding STAR data. While the results at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV can be considered as predictions for results of measurements within the STAR fixed-target (STAR-FXT) programthat are expected in the nearest future. It is predicted that a broad maximum of $P_\Lambda$ is reached at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\approx$ 3--3.9 GeV, exact position of which depends on the centrality and width of the midrapidity range of observation. Impact of the meson-field, thermal-shear and spin-Hall-effect contributions to $P_\Lambda$ is also studied.</description>

      <title>Phantom matters</title>

Abstract: Cosmological observations of the recent universe suggest that dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is growing with time, departing from a cosmological constant for which $w=-1$. Standard quintessence models allow for a varying $w\geq-1$, but observations report that a phantom regime, $w&lt;-1$, is quickly reached in the past. Often discarded because of uncertainties or parametrisation, we rather propose here to embrace the reality of this phantom regime. We revisit an elegant mechanism that accounts for it, thanks to a coupling of quintessence field(s) to matter (and possibly radiation). We show that this allows for steep scalar potentials, and illustrate this with string-inspired models, where $V=V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \varphi}$ and $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$. Those provide solutions in very good agreement with observations, including the phantom regime. We then discuss poles that can appear in $w$, making it diverge at recent times ($z\leq 4$), and that could be detected by observations. We finally comment on an Early Dark Energy-like feature, that systematically appears for free from the models considered, and could be of interest for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14354</link>

Abstract: In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states can enhance the conversion probability.</description>

      <title>UrQMD Simulations of Higher-order Cumulants in Au+Au Collisions at High Baryon Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18832</link>

Abstract: High moments of conserved quantities such as net-baryon, net-electric charge, and net-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to fluctuations caused by the QCD critical point (CP). The event-by-event analysis of high moments of the conserved charges has been widely used in experiments to search for the CP, especially in the RHIC-STAR experiment.
  In order to establish a {\it dynamical non-critical base line}, especially at the high baryon density region, we have performed a systematic analysis of the proton multiplicity distributions from Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq$ $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\leq$ 9.2 GeV collisions. The results on beam energy, centrality and rapidity width dependence of proton (factorial) cumulants, up to the $4^{th}$ order, are extracted from the calculations of the hadronic transport model UrQMD. In addition, the effects of initial volume fluctuation is also discussed. These results will be important when we do physics analysis the RHIC beam energy scan (BES) data, especially for the fixed-target data and experimental data from future CBM experiment at FAIR.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations for smooth sign-switching dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.</description>
