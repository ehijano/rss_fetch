      <title>Superconformal Monodromy Defects in ABJM and mABJM Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $D=11$ supergravity solutions which are dual to one-dimensional superconformal defects in $d=3$ SCFTs. We consider defects in ABJM theory with monodromy for $U(1)^4\subset SO(8)$ global symmetry, as well as in $\mathcal{N}=2$ mABJM SCFT, which arises from the RG flow of a mass deformation of ABJM theory, with monodromy for $U(1)^3\subset SU(3)\times U(1)$ global symmetry. We show that the defects of the two SCFTs are connected by a line of bulk marginal mass deformations and argue that they are also related by bulk RG flow. In all cases we allow for the possibility of conical singularities at the location of the defect. Various physical observables of the defects are computed including the defects conformal weight and the partition function, as well as associated supersymmetric Renyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Scattering off of Twistorial Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently devised chiral algebra bootstrap computes the form factors of a special class of ``twistorial'' 4d QFTs as correlation functions of the theory's 2d celestial chiral algebra. Examples of twistorial theories include self-dual Yang-Mills theory coupled to special massless matter content, and certain form factors in these theories are equivalent to a subset of MHV amplitudes in massless QCD, coupled to the same matter. In this paper, we extend the chiral algebra bootstrap to include scattering in the presence of charged sources, using a self-dual dyon in a twistorial theory as our main example. Self-dual theories in the presence of such sources lift to holomorphic gauge theories on non-Hausdorff twistor space, and we generalize the Koszul duality construction of Costello and Paquette to this setting. With this approach, we easily reproduce a recent formula of Adamo, Bogna, Mason, and Sharma for $n$-point MHV scattering of gluons off the self-dual dyon.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Mechanics of a Spherically Symmetric Causal Diamond in Minkowski Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the phase space of a spherically symmetric causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Utilizing the covariant phase space formalism, we identify the relevant degrees of freedom that localize to the $d$-dimensional bifurcate horizon and, upon canonical quantization, determine their commutators. On this phase space, we find two Iyer-Wald charges. The first of these charges, proportional to the area of the causal diamond, is responsible for shifting the null time along the horizon and has been well-documented in the literature. The second charge is much less understood, being integrable for $d \geq 2$ only if we allow for field-dependent diffeomorphisms and is responsible for changing the size of the causal diamond.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos and complexity from string scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Krylov spread complexity in the context of black hole scattering by studying highly excited string states (HESS). Krylov complexity characterizes chaos by quantifying the spread of a state or operator under a known Hamiltonian. In contrast, quantum field theory often relies on S-matrices, where the Hamiltonian density becomes non-trivially time-dependent rendering the computations of complexity in Krylov basis exponentially hard. We define Krylov spread complexity for scattering amplitudes by analyzing the distribution of extrema, treating these as eigenvalues of a fictional Hamiltonian that evolves a thermo-field double state non-trivially. Our analysis of black hole scattering, through highly excited string states scattering into two or three tachyons, reveals that the Krylov complexity of these amplitudes mirrors the behavior of chaotic Hamiltonian evolution, with a pre-saturation peak indicating chaos. This formalism bridges the concepts of chaos in scattering and state evolution, offering a framework to distinguish different scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Across-Horizon Propagation and Infinite Time-Dilation: An Independent Approach to Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformal scalar propagator as an explicit function of the Schwarzschild black-hole space-time has been established in the preceding three projects. The present project examines the precise relation which that propagator has to the amplitude the Schwarzschild black hole emit a scalar particle in a particular mode of positive energy. It is thereby established that the effect of infinite time-dilation on the event horizon results in both, the thermal radiation in the background of a static exterior space-time geometry and the detraction from thermality if energy-conservation is properly imposed as a constraint on scalar propagation. The derivation of the latter signifies an equivalent approach to the result of Parikh and Wilczek from the semi-classical perspective of the distant observer. From that perspective for that matter, Hawking radiation emerges in both contexts as the exclusive consequence of infinite time-dilation on the event horizon. These results are consistent with Hawking radiation as the exclusive consequence of the causal structure of the Schwarzschild black-hole space-time both, in a static exterior geometry and in such dynamical exterior geometry as energy-conservation signifies. The extension of the thermal case to other spin-fields and black-hole geometries is discussed.</description>

      <title>Proof of the graviton MHV formula using Plebanski's second heavenly equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-dual spacetimes can be thought of as spacetimes containing only positive helicity gravitons. In this work we present a new perturbiner expansion for self-dual spacetimes based on Plebanski's second heavenly equation. Our expansion is naturally organized as a sum over ``marked tree graphs'' where each node corresponds to a positive helicity graviton and can have an arbitrary number of edges. Negative helicity gravitons must be added in by hand.
  We then use this perturbiner expansion to give a first principles derivation of the NSVW tree formula for the MHV amplitude in Einstein gravity. A unique feature of this proof is that it does not use BCFW recursion or twistor theory. It works by plugging the spacetime with arbitrarily many $+$ gravitons and two $-$ gravitons into the on-shell gravitational action and evaluating it. The action we use is the self-dual Plebanski action plus an additional boundary term. Interestingly, the amplitude comes entirely from the boundary term.
  In the appendix we give another way to express our perturbiner expansion using binary tree graphs instead of marked tree graphs, and prove the equivalence of these two expansions diagrammatically. We also provide an introduction to self-dual gravity aimed at non-experts, as well as a proof of the Parke-Taylor formula in Yang Mills theory analogous to our proof of the NSVW formula in gravity.</description>

      <title>A topological contribution to Bogoliubov coefficient for cosmological particle production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle production in cosmology is often efficiently computed in terms of Bogoliubov transforms. Restricting to a particular class of dispersion relationships, we identify a map between the number of particles produced in a special kinematic limit and a Stokes phenomena related topology of analytic continuation of the Bogoliubov coefficient functions. Intuitively, this kinematic limit corresponds to the long wavelength limit although a more precise description depends on the nature of the curved spacetime. To identify the topology, we reformulate the usual Bogoliubov computations as a type of SU(1,1) gauged differential equation and utilize a special gauge together with a discrete symmetry that naturally characterizes the dispersion relationship. Using a dark matter model and a nonzero constant spatial curvature model, we estimate how such topological contributions will arise in physical applications.</description>

      <title>Second-order spin hydrodynamics from Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism, we derive the second-order dissipative tensors in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, {\em viz.} rotational stress tensor ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$), boost heat vector ($q_\mu$), shear stress tensor ($\pi_{\mu\nu}$) and bulk viscous pressure ($\Pi$). The first two ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$ and $q_\mu$) emerge due to the inclusion of the antisymmetric part in the energy-momentum tensor, which, in turn, governs the conservation of spin angular momentum ($\Sigma^{\alpha\mu\nu}$). As a result, new thermodynamic forces, generated due to the antisymmetric part of $T_{\mu \nu}$, contains the spin chemical potential. In this work, we have also taken the spin density ($S^{\mu \nu}$) as an independent thermodynamic variable, in addition to the energy density and particle density, thereby resulting in an additional transport coefficient given by the correlation between $S^{\mu \nu}$ and $\tau^{\mu \nu}$. The newly found terms in $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Pi$ are the artifacts of the new thermodynamic forces that arise due to the antisymmetric part of $T^{\mu \nu}$. Finally we have derived the evolution equations for the aforesaid tensors - $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, $q_\mu$, $\pi_{\mu\nu}$, and $\Pi$.</description>

      <title>Supergravity Spectrum of AdS$_5$ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embed Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes into $\mathcal{N}=8$ gauged supergravity and study quadratic fluctuations around the black hole backgrounds of all fields in the larger theory. The equations of motion of the perturbations are partially diagonalized by the group theory of broken symmetry. Nearly all fields in theory have non-minimal couplings, so their equations of motion are not merely massive Klein-Gordon equations with minimal coupling to background gauge fields, and their analogues for fields with spin. In the special case of extremal black holes we identify specific modes of instability, some of which touch supersymmetric locus. For example, we identify scalar fields in supergravity that condense in the near horizon region and transition the black hole into a superconducting phase. We also identify supergravity modes that are susceptible to superradiant instability.</description>

      <title>Classicality of Stochastic Noise Away From Quasi-de Sitter Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a coarse-grained scalar field living on a de~Sitter (dS) background exhibits classical stochastic behavior, driven by a noise whose amplitude is set by the Hubble constant $H$. The coarse-graining is achieved by discarding wave numbers larger than a cutoff $\sigma H$ and demanding that $\sigma \ll 1$. Similar results hold for quasi-dS space, where the equation of state parameter $w$ is close to $-1$. Here we present exact expressions for the noise amplitude of a free massless field on an inflationary background with constant $w &lt; -1/3$. We find that a classical stochastic behavior can emerge for $-5/3 &lt; w &lt; -1/3$. Furthermore, as we move away from $w = -1$ and approach $w = -1/3$, the constraint $\sigma \ll 1$ is relaxed and larger cutoffs ($\sigma \sim 1$) become feasible, too. However, in general the amplitude of the noise depends on $\sigma$, except in the quasi-dS regime $w \approx -1$.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for the coefficients of multidimensional resultants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04429v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued.</description>

      <title>Statistical Patterns in the Equations of Physics and the Emergence of a Meta-Law of Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics, as a fundamental science, aims to understand the laws of Nature and describe them in mathematical equations. While the physical reality manifests itself in a wide range of phenomena with varying levels of complexity, the equations that describe them display certain statistical regularities and patterns, which we begin to explore here. By drawing inspiration from linguistics, where Zipf's law states that the frequency of any word in a large corpus of text is roughly inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table, we investigate whether similar patterns for the distribution of operators emerge in the equations of physics. We analyse three corpora of formulae and find, using sophisticated implicit-likelihood methods, that the frequency of operators as a function of their rank in the frequency table is best described by an exponential law with a stable exponent, in contrast with Zipf's inverse power-law. Understanding the underlying reasons behind this statistical pattern may shed light on Nature's modus operandi or reveal recurrent patterns in physicists' attempts to formalise the laws of Nature. It may also provide crucial input for symbolic regression, potentially augmenting language models to generate symbolic models for physical phenomena. By pioneering the study of statistical regularities in the equations of physics, our results open the door for a meta-law of Nature, a (probabilistic) law that all physical laws obey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The individual fermion generations of the Standard Model fit neatly into a representation of a simple Grand Unified Theory gauge algebra. If Grand Unification is not realized in nature, this would appear to be a coincidence. We attempt to quantify how frequent this coincidence is among theories with group structure and fermion content similar to the Standard Model. We find that $\mathcal{O}(1/100)$ of consistent fermion representations similar to the Standard Model are unifiable, and discuss how the result depends on our definitions. This purely group-theoretical analysis may be taken as a bottom-up indication for Grand Unification, conceptually similar to a naturalness argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of many body chaotic models related to the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. An emergent symmetry maps the quantum dynamics into a classical stochastic process. Thus we are able to study many dynamical properties at finite N on an arbitrary graph structure. A comprehensive study of operator size growth with or without spatial locality is presented. We will show universal behaviors emerge at large N limit, and compare them with field theory method. We also design simple stochastic processes as an intuitive way of thinking about many-body chaotic behaviors. Other properties including entanglement growth and other variants of this solvable models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Parametrized-Post-Newtonian Test of Black Hole Spacetime for Galactic Center Massive Black Hole Sgr A*: Formulation and $\chi^2$ Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed a parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) test of a black hole spacetime using observational data of the star S0-2/S2 orbiting the massive black hole at our galactic center Sgr A*. After introducing our PPN model of black hole spacetime, we report the result of $\chi^2$ fitting of the PPN model with the observational data. A new finding through our PPN model is a detectability of the gravitational lens effect on the null geodesics connecting S0-2 and observer under the present observational uncertainties, if a PPN parameter is about one order larger than the value for general relativity case. On the other hand, the effect of black hole spin on the S0-2's motion is not detectable. Thus our present PPN test is performed with spherically symmetric vacuum black hole spacetime. The resultant value of the PPN parameter, which corresponds to the minimum $\chi^2$, implies that the gravitational field of Sgr A* is not of Schwarzschild metric or that the existence of sufficient amount of dark matters around Sgr A*. However, the difference between the minimum $\chi^2$ and the $\chi^2$ of Schwarzschild case is not large enough to ensure a statistical significance of non-Schwarzschild result. A more precise statistical analysis than $\chi^2$ statistics is necessary to extract a statistically significant information of the gravitational field of Sgr A* from present observational data. We will report a result by a Bayesian analysis in next paper.</description>

      <title>Superradiant scattering of massive scalar field due to magnetically charged rotating black hole</title>

Abstract: Rotating black holes are well known to amplify the perturbing bosonic fields in certain parameter spaces. This phenomenon is popularly known as superradiance. In addition to rotation in the spacetime, charge plays a crucial role in the amplification process. In the present study, we have considered the spacetime of a magnetically charged rotating black hole emerging from the coupling of nonlinear electromagnetic field configuration to gravity. Due to this black hole spacetime, we have studied the scattering states of a massive scalar field and investigated the superradiant amplification process. We find that the magnetic charge of the spacetime affects the magnitude of the amplification and also significantly enlarges the allowed frequency ranges for which superradiance happens. In comparison, our analysis reveals that some of the behaviours are quite similar to what has been found in the case of the Kerr-Newmann black hole. Moreover, in specific parameter spaces, we observe exact similarities, which could imply a probable correspondence between the magnetically charged black hole and the Kerr-Newman black hole in certain scenarios. In addition to this, we have investigated the superradiant instability regime due to the massive potential barrier and also compared our results with that of the Kerr-Newmann black hole.</description>

      <title>Degree two Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of local curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) theory of local curves, namely, the total spaces of rank two vector bundles with canonical determinant on smooth projective curves. Under a certain genericity condition on the rank two bundles, we propose a general mechanism to compute the degree two GV invariants of local curves. In particular, we determine all the degree two GV invariants when the base curve has genus two. Combined with previous work by Bryan and Pandharipande, we obtain the GV/GW correspondence in this case. When the base curve has genus greater than two, we calculate GV invariants for some extremal genera, providing evidence for the GV/GW conjecture for curves of higher genus.</description>

      <title>Motivating Gauge-Invariant Approaches to Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is noticeable consensus among physicists and philosophers that only gauge-invariant quantities can be physically real. However, this insight that physical quantities must be gauge-invariant is not well-reflected in standard approaches to particle physics. For instance, each and every elementary field/particle of the Standard Model fails to be gauge-invariant! The main objective of this paper is to offer an accessible, concise, and convincing analysis of why philosophers and physicists should devote more of their energy to working on gauge-invariant approaches. Correspondingly, the thesis of this paper is that pursuing gauge-invariant approaches has several virtues. For instance, gauge-invariant reformulations allow us to make particle physics consistent with the mathematical framework in which it is formulated. This is illustrated by how mathematical theorems such as Elitzur's theorem, the Gribov ambiguity, and Haag's theorem pose problems for standard approaches but are avoided by gauge-invariant approaches.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of operator size distribution in q-local quantum Brownian SYK and spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study operator dynamics in Brownian quantum many-body models with $q$-local interactions. The operator dynamics are characterized by the time-dependent size distribution, for which we derive an exact master equation in both the Brownian Majorana Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and the spin model for general $q$. This equation can be solved numerically for large systems. Additionally, we obtain the analytical size distribution in the large $N$ limit for arbitrary initial conditions and $q$. The distributions for both models take the same form, related to the $\chi$-squared distribution by a change of variable, and strongly depend on the initial condition. For small initial sizes, the operator dynamics are characterized by a broad distribution that narrows as the initial size increases. When the initial operator size is below $q-2$ for the Majorana model or $q-1$ for the spin model, the distribution diverges in the small size limit at all times. The mean size of all operators, which can be directly measured by the out-of-time ordered correlator, grows exponentially during the early time. In the late time regime, the mean size for a single Majorana or Pauli operator for all $q$ decays exponentially as $t e^{-t}$, much slower than all other operators, which decay as $e^{-t}$. At finite $N$, the size distribution exhibits modulo-dependent branching within a symmetry sector for the $q \geq 8$ Majorana model and the $q \geq 4$ spin model. Our results reveal universal features of operator dynamics in $q$-local quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Floquet Dynamics for Conformal Field Theories in Dimensions Greater than Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find classes of driven conformal field theories (CFT) in d + 1 dimensions with d &gt; 1, whose quench and Floquet dynamics can be computed exactly. The setup is suitable for studying periodic drives, consisting of square pulse protocols for which Hamiltonian evolution takes place with different deformations of the original CFT Hamiltonian in successive time intervals. These deformations are realized by specific combinations of conformal generators with a deformation parameter $\beta$; the $\beta &lt; 1$ ($\beta &gt; 1$) Hamiltonians can be unitarily related to the standard (Luscher-Mack) CFT Hamiltonian. The resulting time evolution can be then calculated by conformal transformations. For $d\leq 3$ we show that the transformations can be obtained in a quaternion formalism. Evolution with such a single Hamiltonian yields qualitatively different time dependences of observables depending on the value of $\beta$, ranging from exponential decays characteristic of heating to oscillations and power law decays. This manifests in the behavior of the fidelity, unequal-time correlator, and the energy density at the end of a single cycle of a square pulse protocol with different hamiltonians in successive time intervals. When the Hamiltonians in a cycle involve generators of a single SU(1, 1) subalgebra we calculate the Floquet Hamiltonian. We show that one can get dynamical phase transitions by varying the time period of a cycle, where the system can go from a non-heating phase which is oscillatory as a function of the time period to a heating phase with an exponentially damped behavior. Our methods can be generalized to other discrete and continuous protocols. We also point out that our results are expected to hold for a broader class of QFTs that possesses an SL(2, C) symmetry with fields that transform as quasi-primaries under this. As an example, we briefly comment on celestial CFTs in this context.</description>

      <title>Scale symmetry breaking and generation of mass at quantum critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an asymptotically free theory of $N$ relativistic Dirac fermions and a real scalar field coupled by Yukawa and scalar self-interactions in three dimensions using functional renormalisation. In the limit of many fermion flavours, the cubic scalar coupling becomes exactly marginal due to quantum fluctuations, leading to a line of strongly-coupled infrared fixed points. Fermion mass can be generated through a quantum phase transition even if chiral symmetry is absent. The line of fixed points terminates at a critical endpoint due to the loss of vacuum stability. Exactly at the endpoint, scale symmetry is broken spontaneously, leading to the generation of fermion mass. Intriguingly, the absence of chiral symmetry is a prerequisite for the spontaneous generation of fermion mass, and not a consequence thereof. We also highlight close similarities between Gross-Neveu and Gross-Neveu--Yukawa theories at and away from critical points, and establish the large-$N$ equivalence of their functional RG flows and quantum effective actions. Further implications including for conformal field theories are indicated.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy associated with a holographic RG flow from $\textrm{AdS}_7$ to $\textrm{AdS}_{4} \times \mathbb{H}_3$, where $\mathbb{H}_3$ is a $3$-dimensional hyperbolic manifold with curvature $\kappa$. The dual six-dimensional RG flow is disconnected from Lorentz-invariant flows. In this context we address various notions of central charges and identify a monotonic candidate $c$-function that captures IR aspects of the flow. The UV behavior of the holographic entanglement entropy and, in particular its universal term, display an interesting dependence on the curvature, $\kappa$. We then contrast our holographic results with existing field theory computations in six dimensions and find a series of new corrections in curvature to the universal term in the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ holography to investigate Liu-Mezei renormalization group monotones in conformal field theories influenced by massive flavor degrees of freedom. We examine the entanglement entropy of a spherical subregion in three holographic field theories - $\mathcal{N}=1$ Klebanov-Witten theory, $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, and ABJM theory - with fundamental flavor. The gravity dual of massive unquenched flavor is described by dynamical D-branes, and we solve their backreaction in the smeared approximation. We compute entanglement entropy using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in these backreacted geometries. Our findings indicate that the Liu-Mezei A- and F-functions decrease monotonically to leading order in the number of flavors across all examples. Additionally, we calculate the leading flavor contribution to entanglement entropy using an alternative probe brane method that does not require knowledge of backreaction in the bulk geometries. These results consistently match with backreacted calculations in all cases, assuming omission of a specific IR boundary term stemming from a total derivative.</description>

Abstract: We verify that the recently proven infinite families of holographic entropy inequalities are maximally tight, i.e. they are facets of the holographic entropy cone. The proof is technical but it offers some heuristic insight. On star graphs, both families of inequalities quantify how concentrated / spread information is with respect to a dihedral symmetry acting on subsystems. In addition, toric inequalities viewed in the K-basis show an interesting interplay between four-party and six-party perfect tensors.</description>

Abstract: We consider a model of a holographic 2+1d CFT interacting with an oscillating background gauge field. It is solved by an AdS-Vaidya metric describing Ohmic heating of the boundary field theory. However, we also show that if timelike singularities of Kasner type are permitted then a time independent solution that may be interpreted as a Floquet state of the system can be constructed. In this state the system exhibits either Hall conductivity or kinetic induction, and we numerically evaluate the Kasner exponents for a range of boundary conditions. This model may contribute to the ongoing discussion on the validity and meaning of the Kasner metric in the AdS/CFT correspondence and its application in cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generation of fermion mass in a context where interactions break a discrete chiral symmetry. Then, fermion mass is not protected by a symmetry, no symmetry is broken by the generation of mass, and a vanishing mass no longer enhances a symmetry. We elaborate these scenarios for template fermionic and Yukawa theories in three dimensions where mass can be generated either by fluctuations, strong dynamics, or the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field. We find that fluctuation-induced contributions to fermion mass are parametrically suppressed in the number of fermion flavours $N$. The generation of fermion mass then takes the form of a rapid crossover which turns into a second order quantum phase transition for large $N$, much like in settings with fundamental chiral symmetry. We further discuss theories where fermion mass can be generated spontaneously without breaking any symmetry other than scale symmetry. Implications of our findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Static neutral black holes in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity theory, a modified gravity theory that nonminimally couples a KR field with a nonzero vacuum expectation value for the gravitational field, can spontaneously break the Lorentz symmetry of gravity. In a recent work, Yang et al. [Phys. Rev. D 108, 124004 (2023)] successfully derived Schwarzschild-like black hole solutions both with and without a nonzero cosmological constant within the framework of KR gravity. However, their analysis did not address the more general case of static, neutral, spherically symmetric black holes. In this paper, we fill this gap by resolving the field equations to construct more general static, neutral, spherically symmetric black hole solutions both with and without a nonzero cosmological constant. Our black hole solutions are shown to obey the first law and the Bekenstein-Smarr mass formulas of black hole thermodynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that our static neutral spherically symmetric AdS black hole does not always satisfy the reverse isoperimetric inequality (RII), as the isoperimetric ratio can be larger or smaller than unity depending on the placement of the solution parameters within the parameter space. This behavior contrasts with the above-mentioned Schwarzschild-like AdS black hole in the KR gravity theory, which always obeys the RII. Significantly, the present more general static, neutral, spherically symmetric AdS black hole is the first example of a static AdS black hole that can violate the RII.</description>

Abstract: In Gepner's pioneering work, the requirement that leads to a model having the desired $N=1$ Spacetime supersymmetry and $E(8)\times E(6)$ Gauge symmetry was the requirement that the spacetime symmetry is compatible with modular invariance. In this work we show that the requirement for the simultaneous fulfillment of mutual locality of the left-moving vertices of physical states with the space-time symmetry generators and of right-moving vertices with generators of $E(8)\times E(6)$-gauge symmetry, which arises after some special reduction together with the requirement of mutual locality of complete (left-right) vertices of physical states among themselves leads to the same Gepner models.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Spheres in Stringy Matrix Models: Quantifying Chaos in a Mixed Phase Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a truncation of the BMN matrix model to a configuration of two fuzzy spheres, described by two coupled non-linear oscillators dependent on the mass parameter $\mu$. The classical phase diagram of the system generically ($\mu \neq 0$) contains three equilibrium points: two centers and a center-saddle; as $\mu \to 0$ the system exhibits a pitchfork bifurcation. We demonstrate that the system is exactly integrable in quadratures for $\mu=0$, while for very large values of $\mu$, it approaches another integrable point characterized by two harmonic oscillators. The classical phase space is mixed, containing both integrable islands and chaotic regions, as evidenced by the classical Lyapunov spectrum. At the quantum level, we explore indicators of early and late time chaos. The eigenvalue spacing is best described by a Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner distributions; it dovetails, at the quantum level, the classical results and reemphasizes the notion that the quantum system is mixed. We also study the spectral form factor and the quantum Lyapunov exponent, as defined by out-of-time-ordered correlators. These two indicators of quantum chaos exhibit weak correlations with the Brody distribution. We speculate that the behavior of the system as $\mu \to 0$ dominates the spectral form factor and the quantum Lyapunov exponent, making these indicators of quantum chaos less effective in the context of a mixed phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we explore the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) within a scalar field inflationary model coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term, incorporating low-scale spontaneously broken supersymmetric (SB SUSY) potential. The coupling function amplifies the curvature perturbations, consequently leading to the formation of PBHs and the production of detectable secondary gravitational waves (GWs). Through the adjustment of model parameters, the inflaton can be decelerated during the ultra-slow-roll (USR) phase, thereby augmenting curvature perturbations. Swampland criteria are also investigated. Our computations forecast the formation of PBHs with masses on the order of ${\cal O}(10)M_{\odot}$, aligning with observational data from LIGO-Virgo and PBHs with masses ${\cal O}(10^{-6})M_{\odot}$, offering potential explanation for ultrashort-timescale microlensing events recorded in OGLE data. Additionally, our proposed mechanism can generate PBHs with masses around ${\cal O}(10^{-13})M_{\odot}$, constituting roughly 99$\%$ of the dark matter. The density parameter of produced GWs ($\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$) intersects with the sensitivity curves of GW detectors. Two cases of our model fall within the nano-Hz regime. One of these satisfies the $\Omega_{\rm{GW}}(f) \sim f^{5-\gamma}$ fit, with the derived $\gamma = 3.51$ matching the NANOGrav 15-year data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, to obtain a general theory of gravity with Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). For this we use a Weyl gauge covariant formulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge theory, in which this geometry is metric. For $d=4$, in a leading order expansion the DBI action becomes the general Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that has the same gauge symmetry; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda &gt;0$. The series expansion of the DBI action also contains additional non-polynomial terms that can be generated at quantum level in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$, by a regularisation that respects this gauge symmetry. Such a regularisation is automatically provided by the DBI action in $d$ dimensions. If the Weyl gauge boson of dilatations is "pure gauge", the DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action plus a locally Weyl invariant dilaton action.

      <title>Dark Universe Phenomenology from Yukawa Potential?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the effect of cold dark matter in the cosmological setup can be explained by the coupling between the baryonic matter particles in terms of the long-range force having a graviton mass $m_g$ via the Yukawa gravitational potential. Such a quantum-corrected Yukawa-like gravitational potential is characterized by the coupling parameter $\alpha$, the wavelength parameter $\lambda$, which is related to the graviton mass via $m_g=\hbar/(\lambda c)$, that determines the range of the force and, finally, a Planck length quantity $l_0$ that makes the potential regular at the centre. The corrected Friedmann equations are obtained using Verlinde's entropic force interpretation of gravity based on the holographic scenario and the equipartition law of energy. The parameter $\alpha$ modifies Newton's constant as $G_{\rm eff}\rightarrow G(1+\alpha)$. We argue that dark matter is an apparent effect as no dark matter particle exists in this picture. Furthermore, the dark energy is also related to graviton mass and $\alpha$; in particular, we point out that the cosmological constant can be viewed as a self-interaction effect between gravitons. We further show that there exists a precise correspondence with Verlinde's emergent gravity theory, and due to the long-range force, the theory can be viewed as a non-local gravity theory. To this end, we performed the phase space analyses and estimated $\lambda\simeq 10^3 $[Mpc] and $\alpha \in (0.0385,0.0450)$, respectively. Finally, from these values, for the graviton mass, we get $m_g\simeq 10^{-68}$ kg, and cosmological constant $\Lambda \simeq 10^{-52}\rm m^{-2}$. Further, we argue how this theory reproduces the MOND phenomenology on galactic scales via the acceleration of Milgrom $a_0 \simeq 10^{-10}\rm m/s^2$.</description>

      <title>Metrics and geodesics on fuzzy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fuzzy spaces (as special examples of noncommutative manifolds) with their quasicoherent states in order to find their pertinent metrics. We show that they are naturally endowed with two natural "quantum metrics" which are associated with quantum fluctuations of "paths". The first one provides the length the mean path whereas the second one provides the average length of the fluctuated paths. Onto the classical manifold associated with the quasicoherent state (manifold of the mean values of the coordinate observables in the state minimising their quantum uncertainties) these two metrics provides two minimising geodesic equations. Moreover, fuzzy spaces being not torsion free, we have also two different autoparallel geodesic equations associated with two different adiabatic regimes in the move of a probe onto the fuzzy space. We apply these mathematical results to quantum gravity in BFSS matrix models, and to the quantum information theory of a controlled qubit submitted to noises of a large quantum environment.</description>

      <title>Electric and thermoelectric response for Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall configurations including the effects of strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02318v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</description>

      <title>Detecting cosmological scalar fields using orbital networks of quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose to detect the interaction of a hypothetical coherently evolving cosmological scalar field with an orbital network of quantum sensors, focusing on the GPS satellite network as a test example. Cosmological scenarios, such as a scalar-tensor theory for dark energy or the axi-Higgs model, suggest that such a field may exist. As this field would be (approximately) at rest in the CMB frame, it would exhibit a dipole as a result of the movement of our terrestrial observers relative to the CMB. While the current sensitivity of the GPS network is insufficient to detect a cosmological dipole, future networks of quantum sensors on heliocentric orbits, using state-of-the-art atomic clocks, can reach and exceed this requirement.</description>

      <title>Security of quantum position-verification limits Hamiltonian simulation via holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the link between quantum position-verification (QPV) and holography established in [MPS19] using holographic quantum error correcting codes as toy models. By inserting the "temporal" scaling of the AdS metric by hand via the bulk Hamiltonian interaction strength, we recover a toy model with consistent causality structure. This leads to an interesting implication between two topics in quantum information: if position-based verification is secure against attacks with small entanglement then there are new fundamental lower bounds for resources required for one Hamiltonian to simulate another.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emergence of quantum state designs in systems with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state $t$-designs by hinging on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state $t$-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge. We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with translation symmetry. We find faster convergence of the trace distance during the early time evolution in comparison to the cases when the symmetry is broken. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Hidden Symmetries of Power-Law Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A scalar field with an exponential potential has been proposed as a model of inflation (called power-law inflation). Although it admits an exact solution, the integrability of the system has not been shown.We uncover the hidden symmetries behind the system by utilising the Eisenhart lift of field theories. We find that a conformal Killing vector field in the field space exists only for a particular combination of exponential functions that includes a single exponential potential. This implies the existence of additional conserved quantity and explains the integrability of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if dark matter consists of QCD axions in the post-inflationary scenario more than ten percent of it efficiently collapses into Bose stars at matter-radiation equality. Such a result is mostly independent of the present uncertainties on the axion mass. This large population of solitons, with asteroid masses and Earth-Moon distance sizes, might plausibly survive until today, with potentially interesting implications for phenomenology and experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is categorized into two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements: This group comprises 19 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements: This category includes 31 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, time-delay strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between these two groups. The distance ladder-based measurements yield a weighted mean $H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, while the one-step measurements result in a weighted mean $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To quantify the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which yielded a p-value of 0.000102. This extremely low p-value strongly indicates that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that late-time one-step measurements of $H_0$ are more consistent with early-time measurements, indicating that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early-time and late-time measurements per se, but specifically between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>
