      <title>JanusDNA: A Powerful Bi-directional Hybrid DNA Foundation Model</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.

      <title>Federated Learning in Genetics: Extended Analysis of Accuracy, Performance and Privacy Trade-offs</title>

Abstract: Machine learning on large-scale genomic or transcriptomic data is important for many novel health applications. For example, precision medicine tailors medical treatments to patients on the basis of individual biomarkers, cellular and molecular states, etc. However, the data required is sensitive, voluminous, heterogeneous, and typically distributed across locations where dedicated machine learning hardware is not available. Due to privacy and regulatory reasons, it is also problematic to aggregate all data at a trusted third party. Federated learning is a promising solution to this dilemma, because it enables decentralized, collaborative machine learning without exchanging raw data. In this paper, we perform comparative experiments with the federated learning frameworks TensorFlow Federated and Flower. Our test case is the training of disease prognosis and cell type classification models. We train the models with distributed transcriptomic data, considering both data heterogeneity and architectural heterogeneity. We measure model quality, robustness against privacy-enhancing noise and computational performance. We evaluate the resource overhead of a federated system from both client and global perspectives and assess benefits and limitations. Each of the federated learning frameworks has different strengths. However, our experiments confirm that both frameworks can readily build models on transcriptomic data, without transferring personal raw data to a third party with abundant computational resources.
