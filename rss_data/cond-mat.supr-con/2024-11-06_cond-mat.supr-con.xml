      <title>Adatom engineering magnetic order in superconductors: Applications to altermagnetic superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically how superlattices based on adatoms on surfaces of unconventional superconductors can be used to engineer novel pairing states that break time-reversal symmetry and exhibit non-trivial magnetic point symmetries. We illustrate this using a square-lattice Hubbard model with $d$-wave superconductivity and a subleading $s$-wave state as an example. An adatom superlattice with square-lattice symmetries is shown to stabilize an "orbital-altermagnetic superconductor'', a state that exhibits loop current patterns and associated orbital magnetic moments, which preserve superlattice translations but are odd under four-fold rotations. This state is further characterized by a non-zero Berry curvature quadrupole moment and, upon including spin-orbit coupling, by an altermagnetic spin splitting of the bands and non-trivial spin textures in the superlattice unit cell, with zero net spin moment.</description>

      <title>Topological incommensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductor and Bogoliubov Fermi surface in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a random phase approximation (RPA) calculation for a spin-valley polarized model of the rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene to study the possibility of chiral superconductor from the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. We included the realistic band structure and form factor in our calculation and solved the self-consistent equation numerically by sampling 20,000 points in the momentum space at a given temperature. Around the Van-Hove singularity (VHS), we find p-ip pairing with Chern number switching from $C=-1$ to $C=0$ through a gap closing at $\mathbf k=(0,0)$ (defined relative to $\mathbf K$). Although the superconductor is generically fully gapped at low temperature, we find Bogoliubov Fermi surface at temperature just below mean field $T_c$. Besides, through calculation of the free energy, we conclude that the optimal Cooper pair momentum $\mathbf Q$ is generically finite and can be as large as $0.1 k_F$. We dub the $\mathbf Q\neq 0$ phase as an incommensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(FFLO) superconductor to distinguish it from the $\mathbf Q=0$ phase. Compared to the $\mathbf Q=0$ phase, our incommensurate $\mathbf Q$ phase is a nematic superconductor if it is in the Fulde-Ferrell(FF) phase or exhibts charge density wave (CDW) if it is in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) phase. Our work demonstrates the rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene as a wonderful platform to explore Majorana zero-mode, FFLO physics and Bogoliubov fermi surface within one single platform.</description>

      <title>Fate of the Josephson effect and odd-frequency pairing in superconducting junctions with unconventional magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.</description>

      <title>Clear Reduction in Spin Susceptibility and Superconducting Spin Rotation for $H \parallel a$ in the Early-Stage Sample of Spin-Triplet Superconductor UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the re-measurement of the $a$-axis spin susceptibility component in an early-stage sample of the spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ with the transition temperature of $T_{\rm SC}$ = 1.6 K. Using Knight-shift measurements along the $b$ axis and at a 10-degree tilt from the $b$ axis towards the $a$ axis, we accurately determined the $a$-axis component without directly measuring the $a$-axis Knight shift. Our results reveal a decrease of approximately 3\% in the $a$-axis spin susceptibility in the superconducting state under $a$-axis magnetic field $\mu_0 H_a \sim 0.1$ T, indicating that the spin susceptibility decreases similarly in both early-stage and ultraclean samples with $T_{\rm SC}$ = 2.1 K. The previously reported absence of the reduction in Knight shift is attributed to the missing of signal from the superconducting region and to the detection of residual signals from the non-superconducting region instead. We also found that the decrease in the $a$-axis spin susceptibility is immediately suppressed with increasing the $a$-axis magnetic field and is estimated to be completely suppressed at around 1.5 T due to superconducting spin rotation.</description>

      <title>Extraction and Simulation of the Impact of Flux Trapping in Moats of AC-Biased Shift Registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moats in superconducting ground planes are used to trap magnetic flux away from sensitive parts of superconductor integrated circuits. We simulate the effect of magnetic flux trapped in moats on the operating margins of ac-biased SFQ shift registers (ShReg) with two ground planes for various congruent moat geometries, moat sizes, locations in the ShReg cells, number and polarity of the trapped of fluxons. Using inductance extractor InductEx, we extract mutual couplings between the moats and the ShReg inductors and include them in the refined netlist. Then, we use JoSim to simulate the circuit operation and find the threshold ac clock amplitude above which the register starts to operate correctly. The relative change in this threshold is used to characterize the influence of flux trapping on the circuit operation. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to investigate the effect of the circuit parameter variations on the statistics of the threshold, using the standard deviation of the Josephson junction critical current and of the circuit inductance extracted from the fabrication process control monitors. The obtained distributions are compared with the independently measured distributions of the threshold amplitude for the individual cells of ac-biased shift registers with 108,500 Josephson junctions. The results show that flux trapping in properly designs moats have a very small effect on the operation margins of the large-scale shift registers whereas the main contribution to the cell-to-cell variation of the threshold comes from the variation of the junctions' critical currents.</description>

      <title>Voltage-controlled synthesis of higher harmonics in hybrid Josephson junction circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of the current-phase relation of two voltage-controlled semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson junctions (JJs) in series. The two hybrid junctions behave similar to a single-mode JJ with effective transparency determined by the ratio of Josephson coupling strengths of the two junctions. Gate-voltage control of Josephson coupling (measured from switching currents) allows tuning of the harmonic content from sinusoidal, for asymmetric tuning, to highly nonsinusoidal, for symmetric tuning. The experimentally observed tunable harmonic content agrees with a model based on two conventional (sinusoidal) JJs in series.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Majorana and Shiba states in a minimal Kitaev chain coupled to a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) coupled through a superconductor constitute a minimal realisation of a Kitaev chain with Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Such MZMs can be detected by e.g., tunneling conductance between each QD and normal leads [Dvir et al, Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. We here discuss how the seemingly trivial substitution of one of the normal leads by a superconducting (SC) one gives rise to a plethora of new effects. In particular, the coupling to the SC lead induces non-local Majorana effects upon variations of the QDs' energies. Furthermore, the lowest excitation of the chain is no longer determined by the bulk gap but rather by the energy of an emergent subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state coexisting with the MZMs. The YSR state hybridizes with the MZMs when the coupling between the SC and the QD is larger than the spin splitting, spoiling the Majorana properties, including the quantized conductance.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in three-dimensional interacting doped topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional doped Dirac insulators foster simply connected (in both topological and trivial regimes) and annular (deep inside the topological regime) Fermi surfaces (FSs) in the normal state, and allow on-site repulsions among fermions with opposite spin ($U_1$) and parity ($U_2$) eigenvalues. From an unbiased leading-order (one-loop) renormalization group analysis, controlled by a suitable $\epsilon$ expansion, we show that this system develops a strong propensity toward the nucleation of scalar $s$-wave and odd-parity pseudoscalar $p$-wave pairings, favored by repulsive $U_1$ and $U_2$ interactions, respectively, irrespective of the underlying FS topology. Our results can be pertinent for the observed superconductivity in various doped narrow gap semiconductors, and the theoretical foundation can readily be applied to investigate similar phenomenon in various doped topological materials.</description>
