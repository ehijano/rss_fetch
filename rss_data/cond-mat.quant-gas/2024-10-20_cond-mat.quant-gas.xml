      <title>Wave turbulence in driven dipolar gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium turbulent response of driven three-dimensional dipolar gases is monitored by dynamically crossing the supersolid-to-superfluid phase transition and vice versa utilizing a periodically modulated scattering length. Following the generation of vortical defects in the bulk, a direct cascade front emerges transporting energy from larger to smaller length scales and leading to a nonequilibrium quasi-steady state at long evolution times. This quasi-steady state is evidenced by the self-similar character of the momentum distributions featuring an algebraic reduction at large momenta with scaling exponents supporting the existence of wave turbulence. We observe that supersolidity sustaining higher-lying momenta, associated with the roton minimum, promotes the emergence of turbulence. Our results provide a stepping stone for unravelling and exploiting turbulent and self-similar behavior in anisotropically interacting quantum gases amenable in current experiments.</description>

      <title>Extractable energy from quantum superposition of current states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the energy content of superpositions of current states. Specifically, we focus on the maximum energy that can be extracted from them through local unitary transformations. The figure of merit we employ is the local ergotropy. We perform a complete analysis in the whole range of the system's parameters. This way, we prove that superpositions of two current states in spatially closed spin networks are characterized by specific peaks in extractable energy, generally overcoming the power of each of the two separate current states characterized by a single winding number. The many-body state dynamics entails to ergotropy evolving in a controlled fashion. The implementation we suggest is based on a Rydberg-atom platform. Optimal transformations able to extract locally the maximum possible amount of energy are sorted out.</description>

      <title>Quenching from superfluid to free bosons in two dimensions: entanglement, symmetries, and quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice after a sudden quench from the superfluid phase to the free-boson regime. The initial superfluid state is described approximately using both the Bogoliubov theory and the Gaussian variational principle. The subsequent time evolution remains Gaussian, and we compare the results from each approximation of the initial state by examining different aspects of the dynamics. First, we analyze the entanglement entropy and observe that, in both cases, it increases linearly with time before reaching a saturation point. This behavior is attributed to the propagation of entangled pairs of quantum depletions in the superfluid state. Next, we explore the fate of particle-number symmetry, which is spontaneously broken in the superfluid phase. To do so, we use the entanglement asymmetry, a recently introduced observable that enables us to track symmetry breaking within a subsystem. We observe that its evolution varies qualitatively depending on the theory used to describe the initial state. However, in both cases, the symmetry remains broken and is never restored in the stationary state. Finally, we assess the time it takes to reach the stationary state by evaluating the quantum fidelity between the stationary reduced density matrix and the time-evolved one. Interestingly, within the Gaussian variational principle, we find that an initial state further from the stationary state can relax more quickly than one closer to it, indicating the presence of the recently discovered quantum Mpemba effect. We derive the microscopic conditions necessary for this effect to occur and demonstrate that these conditions are never met in the Bogoliubov theory.</description>

      <title>Experimental protocol for observing single quantum many-body scars with transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are energy eigenstates which fail to reproduce thermal expectation values of local observables in systems, where the rest of the many-body spectrum fulfils eigenstate thermalization. Experimental observation of quantum many-body scars has so far been limited to models with multiple scar states. Here we propose protocols to observe single scars in architectures of fixed-frequency, fixed-coupling superconducting qubits. We first adapt known models possessing the desired features into a form particularly suited for the experimental platform. We develop protocols for the implementation of these models, through trotterized sequences of two-qubit cross-resonance interactions, and verify the existence of the approximate scar state in the stroboscopic effective Hamiltonian. Since a single scar cannot be detected from coherent revivals in the dynamics, differently from towers of scar states, we propose and numerically investigate alternative and experimentally-accessible signatures. These include the dynamical response of the scar to local state deformations, to controlled noise, and to the resolution of the Lie-Suzuki-Trotter digitization.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional many-body localized systems coupled to a heat bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of coupling a two-dimensional many-body localized system to a finite heat bath, using shallow quantum circuits as a variational ansatz. Specifically, we simulate optical lattice experiments with two components of ultracold bosons, where only one species is subject to a random disorder potential and the other acts as a heat bath. We obtain a filling fraction dependent phase diagram with a critical filling consistent with experiments. We also calculate two-point correlation functions and the quantum mutual information between sites. We observe a distribution of the quantum mutual information in the many-body localized regime which is consistent with the presence of resonances, similar to those observed in one-dimensional many-body localized systems.</description>

      <title>Fate of chiral order and impurity self-pinning in flat bands with local symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting bosons on a single plaquette threaded by a $\pi$-flux can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a chiral loop current. Connecting such bosonic $\pi$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $\pi$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</description>

      <title>Comparing numerical methods for hydrodynamics in a one-dimensional lattice spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ergodic quantum spin chains, locally conserved quantities such as energy or particle number generically evolve according to hydrodynamic equations as they relax to equilibrium. We investigate the complexity of simulating hydrodynamics at infinite temperature with multiple methods: time evolving block decimation (TEBD), TEBD with density matrix truncation (DMT), the recursion method with a universal operator growth hypothesis (R-UOG), and operator-size truncated (OST) dynamics. Density matrix truncation and the OST dynamics give consistent dynamical correlations to $t=60/J$ and diffusion coefficients agreeing within 1%. TEBD only converges for $t\lesssim 20$, but still produces diffusion coefficients accurate within 1%. The universal operator growth hypothesis fails to converge and only matches other methods on short times. We see no evidence of long-time tails in either DMT or OST calculations of the current-current correlator, although we cannot rule out that they appear at longer times. We do observe power-law corrections to the energy density correlator. At finite wavelength, we observe a crossover from purely diffusive, overdamped decay of the energy density, to underdamped oscillatory behavior similar to that of cold atom experiments. We dub this behavior "hot band second sound" and offer a microscopically-motivated toy model.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>
