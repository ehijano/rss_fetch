      <title>Tensor Network for Anomaly Detection in the Latent Space of Proton Collision Events at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of discovering new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) demands constant innovation in algorithms and technologies. Tensor networks are mathematical models on the intersection of classical and quantum machine learning, which present a promising and efficient alternative for tackling these challenges. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based strategy for anomaly detection at the LHC and demonstrate its superior performance in identifying new phenomena compared to established quantum methods. Our model is a parametrized Matrix Product State with an isometric feature map, processing a latent representation of simulated LHC data generated by an autoencoder. Our results highlight the potential of tensor networks to enhance new-physics discovery.</description>

      <title>Frequentist Uncertainties on Neural Density Ratios with wifi Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce wifi ensembles as a novel framework to obtain asymptotic frequentist uncertainties on density ratios, with a particular focus on neural ratio estimation in the context of high-energy physics. When the density ratio of interest is a likelihood ratio conditioned on parameters, wifi ensembles can be used to perform simulation-based inference on those parameters. After training the basis functions f_i(x), uncertainties on the weights w_i can be straightforwardly propagated to the estimated parameters without requiring extraneous bootstraps. To demonstrate this approach, we present an application in quantum chromodynamics at the Large Hadron Collider, using wifi ensembles to estimate the likelihood ratio between generated quark and gluon jets. We use this learned likelihood ratio to estimate the quark fraction in a synthetic mixed quark/gluon sample, showing that the resultant uncertainties empirically satisfy the desired coverage properties.</description>

      <title>Generator Based Inference (GBI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical inference in physics is often based on samples from a generator (sometimes referred to as a ``forward model") that emulate experimental data and depend on parameters of the underlying theory. Modern machine learning has supercharged this workflow to enable high-dimensional and unbinned analyses to utilize much more information than ever before. We propose a general framework for describing the integration of machine learning with generators called Generator Based Inference (GBI). A well-studied special case of this setup is Simulation Based Inference (SBI) where the generator is a physics-based simulator. In this work, we examine other methods within the GBI toolkit that use data-driven methods to build the generator. In particular, we focus on resonant anomaly detection, where the generator describing the background is learned from sidebands. We show how to perform machine learning-based parameter estimation in this context with data-derived generators. This transforms the statistical outputs of anomaly detection to be directly interpretable and the performance on the LHCO community benchmark dataset establishes a new state-of-the-art for anomaly detection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>A New State of Matter between the Hadronic Phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice-QCD simulations and theoretical arguments hint at the existence of an intermediate phase of strongly interacting matter between a confined hadron gas and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). We qualitatively and semi-quantitatively explore and differentiate the phase structures in the temperature window from the QCD pseudo-critical temperature $T_c\simeq 160\;\text{MeV}$ to the pure-gluonic deconfinement temperature $T_d\simeq 285\;\text{MeV}$. We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \lesssim T \lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\sim 285\;\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard and Tsallis distributions from transverse momentum spectra in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons, specifically the bosons $\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$ as well as the fermions $p(\bar p)$, produced in small collision systems, namely deuteron-gold (d+Au) and proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the top energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, are investigated in this paper. In present study, d+Au collisions are categorized into three centrality classes: central (0--20\%), semi-central (20--40\%), and peripheral (40--100\%) collisions. Various types of distributions, including tandard [Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) and Boltzmann] and Tsallis distributions, are employed to fit the same $p_T$ spectra to derive different effective temperatures denoted as $T_{eff}$. The results indicate that $T_{eff}$ values obtained from Bose-Einstein, Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Tsallis distributions exhibit orderly a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, these $T_{eff}$ values also show a decreasing trend with a decrease in collision centrality. Furthermore, based on the spectra of given particles, a perfect linear relationship is observed between different pairwise combinations of $T_{eff}$ derived from both Boltzmann and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions as well as between Tsallis and Bose-Einstein (Fermi-Dirac) distributions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of the magnetic field and chemical potential on holographic jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet quenching is studied in a background magnetic field and a finite baryon chemical potential. The production of energetic partons is calculated using the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) parton model, while the parton energy loss formula is obtained from the AdS/CFT correspondence incorporating the magnetic field and baryon chemical potential effects. Using Bayesian inference, we systemically compare the theoretical calculations with experimental data for the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ of the large transverse momentum hadrons in different-centrality nucleus-nucleus collisions at 0.2, 2.76 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. The form of the holographic energy loss leads to a strong negative correlation between the magnetic field and the chemical potential after the calibration, from which we discussed the sensitivity of jet quenching phenomena to magnetic field and baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Initial condition for the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the initial condition of the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy using HERA deep inelastic scattering data. Posterior distributions characterizing the initial condition are extracted using Bayesian inference. The total cross section and charm quark production data from HERA are found to provide stringent constraints on the posterior. These distributions quantify the uncertainty in the initial condition and serve as necessary input for propagating uncertainties to all NLO calculations within the Color Glass Condensate framework.</description>

      <title>Quark Wigner distribution in frame-independent 3-dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quark Wigner distribution in a frame-independent, three-dimensional position space within the framework of the dressed quark model. It is observed that the distributions are concentrated near the center of the target and gradually diminish as one moves away in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. The distribution exhibits symmetry along both axes, indicating an equal probability of locating the quark in either direction around the center. Interestingly, the spatial profile of the distribution resembles that of atomic orbitals, where the probability of finding an electron is highest in certain regions compared to others.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Fast Calculation of High-Order Q-Cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of Q-cumulants has been shown as a powerful tool to study the fine details of the azimuthal anisotropies in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. A new method for the fast calculation of arbitrary order Q-cumulant v_{n}\{2k\} values, based on the partition of a non-negative integer l $\le$ m for calculation of the 2m-particle azimuthal correlations is presented in this paper. Unlike the standard Q-cumulants method in which the calculation of high-order multi-particle calculations is impractical, the newly proposed method enables easy calculation. The validity of the method is proven via a toy model that uses the elliptic power distribution to simulate anisotropic emission of particles. The method enables the study of fine details of the v_{2} distribution, such as higher-order central moments of the v_{2} distribution, as well as the hydrodynamic behavior of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Decays of the vector charmonium and bottomonium hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full widths of the vector charmonium and bottomonium hybrid mesons $H_{ \mathrm{c}}$ and $H_{\mathrm{b}}$, characterized by the quantum numbers $1^{ \mathrm{--}}$, are determined by analyzing their dominant strong decay modes: $H_{\mathrm{c}} \to D^{+}D^{-}$, $D_{0}\overline{D}_{0}$, $ D_{s}^{+}D_{s}^{-} $ and $H_{\mathrm{b}} \to B^{+}B^{-}$, $B_{0}\overline{B} _{0}$. To evaluate the partial widths of these channels, we employ the QCD three-point sum rule approach, which provides a reliable method for extracting the strong coupling constants at the relevant hybrid-meson-meson interaction vertices. Based on this analysis, the full widths of these hybrid quarkonia are found to be $\Gamma _{H_{\mathrm{c}}} =(234.1\pm 37.4)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ and $\Gamma _{H_{\mathrm{b}}} =(78.8\pm 15.4)~\mathrm{MeV} $ . These results are expected to facilitate the interpretation of future experimental data concerning the spectroscopy and decay patterns of exotic charmonium- and bottomonium-like hybrid mesons.</description>

      <title>Unwinding the rare $\Omega$ sector: Fragmentation of fully charmed baryons from HL-LHC to FCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By adopting a hadron-structure-oriented approach, we present and discuss the release of the novel OMG3Q1.0 set of collinear fragmentation functions for fully charmed, rare $\Omega$ baryons. Our methodology combines diquark-like proxy model inputs for both charm-quark and gluon channels, calculated at the initial energy scales, with a DGLAP evolution that ensures a consistent treatment of heavy-quark thresholds, following directly from the HF-NRevo scheme. We complement our work with a phenomenological study of NLL/NLO$^+$ resummed $\Omega_{3c}$ plus jet distributions using (sym)JETHAD at the HL-LHC and the future FCC. Unraveling the production mechanisms of rare, yet-unobserved hadrons, as provided by the OMG3Q1.0 functions, stands as a key asset for deepening our understanding of QCD at future high-energy hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Centre-of-momentum frame analysis of $\eta$ production in DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep understanding of neutrino-nucleus interaction is crucial for the precise measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters and cross section measurements. Various nuclear effects, such as initial state effects (IS) and Final state interactions (FSI), make neutrino interactions more complicated. To probe the impacts of the nuclear effects, a separate study of FSI and IS is required. A set of variables known as Centre-of-momentum (c.m.) variables ($\theta_{c.m.}$ and $E_{c.m.}$) provides a unique approach to isolate the FSI effect with minimal sensitivity to IS. This work presents the importance of c.m. variables in neutrino-induced eta ($\eta$) meson production in the DUNE near detector. $\theta_{c.m.}$ is an important parameter to improve the FSI modeling, while $E_{c.m.}$ helps in isolating high-purity neutrino-Hydrogen events. The study of $\eta$ production in neutrino interactions helps in understanding the theoretical descriptions of higher resonance states.</description>

      <title>Photon-induced production of the exotic charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ off nuclear targets and its internal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility to study the famous charged charmonium-like state $Z_c(3900)$ production off nuclear targets and its properties in inclusive photon-induced reactions near the kinematic threshold within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for its charged components $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production in direct photon--nucleon interactions as well as three different popular scenarios for their internal structures: compact tetraquarks, molecules of the two open-charm mesons and mixtures of both of them. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for production of $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ mesons on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at initial photon energies of 9.0--17.5 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections and their ratios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ and at photon energy of 14 GeV as well as the A-dependences of the ratios of the total cross sections for $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ production at photon energy of 14 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to the $Z_c(3900)^{\pm}$ internal structures which are by far the best known. Hence, they might be useful for the determination of these structures -- the issue which has attracted much attention in the hadron physics community -- from the comparison of them with the experimental data from the future high-precision experiments at the CEBAF facility.</description>

Abstract: We study the lepton flavour conserving and violating couplings of a doubly charged scalar at a 3 TeV muon collider. Using a model independent Lagrangian, we analyse the electron electron, muon muon, and tau tau final states mediated by the doubly charged scalar to probe individual couplings to mu e, mu mu, and mu tau. We find that for a doubly charged scalar of mass greater than 1 TeV and order one couplings, we achieve high signal significance in these channels. We delineate the collider s sensitivity in the mass vs coupling plane, highlighting the extensive reach of the muon collider in probing these couplings far beyond the current experimental limits. We also propose an angular distribution variable to discriminate the exchange of a doubly charged scalar from that of a neutral scalar, which give identical signals.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$ and $\rho$ Regge trajectories for the pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ in the diquark-triquark picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Regge trajectory relations for the fully heavy pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ utilizing both diquark and triquark Regge trajectory relations. Using these new relations, we discuss four series of Regge trajectories: the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, $\lambda_1$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories. We provide rough estimates for the masses of the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, $\lambda_1$-, and $\lambda_2$-excited states. Except for the $\lambda_1$-trajectories, the complete forms of the other three series of Regge trajectories for the pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ are lengthy and cumbersome. We show that the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories can not be obtained by simply imitating the meson Regge trajectories because mesons have no substructures. To derive these trajectories, pentaquark's structure and substructure should be taken into consideration. Otherwise, the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories must rely solely on fitting existing theoretical or future experimental data. The fundamental relationship between the slopes of the obtained trajectories and constituents' masses and string tension will remain unclear, and the predictive power of the Regge trajectories would be compromised. Moreover, we show that the lengthy complete forms of the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories can be well approximated by the simple fitted formulas. Four series of Regge trajectories for the pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ all exhibit a behavior of $M{\sim}x^{2/3}$, where $x=n_{r_1},n_{r_2},l_1,l_2,N_{r_1},N_{r_2},L_1,L_2$. All four series of trajectories exhibit concave downward behavior in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various approximate symmetries exist in nature. For example, the flavor $SU(4)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange/charm$ quarks is severely broken, the flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry involving the $up/down/strange$ quarks is moderately broken, and the isospin $SU(2)$ symmetry involving the $up/down$ quarks is slightly broken. These broken symmetries are primarily governed by the strong interaction, making them an ideal platform for investigating the general behavior of approximate symmetries. To explore the application of the flavor $SU(4)$ group to ground-state baryons, we systematically calculate the transition matrices associated with various flavor $SU(4)$ representations as well as the matrices that describe their connections. These matrices are then employed to analyze the mass spectrum of ground-state baryons. Our results indicate that these states can be described as mixtures of various flavor representations, such as $\Sigma_c/\Xi_c^\prime/\Omega_c \sim \mathbf{20_M} \oplus \mathbf{20_S}\oplus \mathbf{\bar{4}_A}~[SU(4)]$, $\Xi_c/\Xi_c^\prime \sim \mathbf{\bar 3_A} \oplus \mathbf{6_S}~[SU(3)]$, $\Lambda^0/\Sigma^0 \sim \mathbf{1_A} \oplus \mathbf{3_S}~[SU(2)]$, where the subscripts $\mathbf{S}$, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{M}$ denote the symmetric, antisymmetric, and mixed flavor wave functions, respectively. Our results also indicate that the flavor symmetries, as they break, necessitate the mixing of these flavor representations according to specific rules.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetry in a two-Higgs-doublet model from quantum information and magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of scattering processes in scalar models with two Higgs doublets have recently hinted at a connection between the absence of flavour-space entanglement in $\Phi^+\Phi^0$ scattering and an emergent $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry in the scalar potential. We extend the analysis to all scattering channels with two particles in the external states by treating the process as a four-qubit system in the weak isospin and flavour subspaces of the $2$-particle state. We work with a generic quantum information-theoretic principle encoded by the commutativity of the initial state density matrix with the transition matrix (at leading order in perturbation theory). This yields a special case of the entanglement minimisation conditions previously derived in the literature, and we interpret the principle in terms of the conservation of non-stabiliserness (or magic). Working at leading order in the quartic couplings, we find a consistent set of conditions that implies an $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry on the quartic part of the potential for scattering an arbitrary initial state, but a smaller $\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ symmetry when the initial state is chosen to have definite isospin. This follows by accounting for Bose symmetry in the initial state, which introduces entanglement between the isospin and flavour subspaces.</description>

      <title>Thermal dilepton production within conformal viscous Gubser flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing the Gubser solutions of causal relativistic second-order Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics, we study the thermal dilepton production from heavy-ion collisions, considering the transverse expansion of the viscous hot QCD medium along with longitudinal boost-invariance. We analyze the evolution of the temperature and shear stress profiles of the QCD matter under Gubser flow for different values of the associated parameter $q$ (inverse length scale). We study the dilepton production using leading order Born rates from QGP and hadronic sectors under Gubser geometry. Viscous modified dilepton rate is calculated using the first-order Chapman-Enskog (CE) like non-equilibrium correction of the particle distribution function. Our study indicates that lower values of $q$ result in the enhancement of the emitted dilepton spectra. We also determine the effective temperature of the hot QCD medium from the inverse slope of transverse mass spectra, for different $q$. We find that the effective temperature determined from the dilepton spectra for a smaller system to be higher. Further, we compare the strength of CE like and Grad's viscous correction to the ideal dilepton spectra and find that CE type viscous corrections are well behaved compared to that of Grad's in the presence of transverse flow.</description>

      <title>Biased rate estimates in bump-hunt searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cleanest way to discover a new particle is generally the "bump-hunt" methodology: looking for a localised excess in a mass (or related) distribution. However, if the mass of the particle being discovered is not known the procedure of quoting the most significant excess seen is "greedy", and random fluctuations from the background can be merged with the signal. This means that an observed 3{\sigma} evidence probably has the rate over-estimated by of order 10% and the mass uncertainty underestimated by more like 20%. If the width of the particle being discovered is also unknown, or the experimental resolution uncertain, the effect grows larger. In the context of LHC, the data-doubling period is now measured in years. If evidence for a genuine signal is obtained at the 3{\sigma} level, the true signal rate probably corresponds to a lower significance. The additional data required to produce a 5{\sigma} discovery may be hundreds of inverse femtobarn more than might be naively expected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application range of perfect spin hydrodynamics is studied in two cases: one based on the classical spin description and the other using a quantum spin density matrix (Wigner function). Different forms of the conditions connecting the components of the spin polarization tensor, particle mass, temperature, and hydrodynamic flow are introduced, and their mutual relations are explained. The results obtained are important for practical applications of spin hydrodynamics to model heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy in the no-scale Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We add a new scalar field in the no-scale Brans-Dicke gravity and require it to have a global O(2) symmetry with the original scalar field in the Brans-Dicke gravity. This gives us a new massless scalar field in the Einstein frame due to the SO(2) symmetry. We then explicitly break the O(2) symmetry to a $D_4$ symmetry, and this scalar field gains a periodic potential. This scalar field can serve as the quintessence field to explain dark energy. If we further add the $R^2$ term and the non-minimal coupling to the Higgs field, we can realize inflation and reheating, and this leads to a super-Planckian decay constant of the quintessence potential. The super-Planckian decay constant is consistent with the newly released observational data according to a recent analysis.</description>

      <title>Searching for charged Higgs bosons via $e^+ e^- \to H^\pm W^\mp S$ at the ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson at the International Linear Collider (ILC) within the framework of the type-X Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), where a light charged Higgs boson, with a mass around 200 GeV or even smaller than top quark mass, is still being consistent with flavor physics data as well as with the colliders experimental data. In the theoretically and experimentally allowed parameter space, the $e^+ e^- \to H^\pm W^\mp S$ (with $S = H, A$) production processes can yield signatures with event rates larger than those from $e^+ e^- \to H^+ H^-$ and offer sensitivity to the Higgs mixing parameter $\sin(\beta-\alpha)$. We consider the bosonic $H^\pm \to W^\pm S$ decays, where the neutral scalar $S$ further decays into a pair of tau leptons. We show, through a detector-level Monte Carlo analysis, that the resulting $[\tau\tau][\tau\tau] WW$ final state could be seen at the ILC with at least 500 GeV center-of-mass energy and 500 fb$^{-1}$ of luminosity.</description>

      <title>An Effective Sphaleron Awakens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using thermal effective field theory, we present a self-consistent perturbative formulation of the Higgs phase sphaleron rate after a radiatively-induced first-order phase transition. This gauge-invariant formulation is based on dimensionally reduced effective field theory (3D EFT) at high temperatures and paves a way for including higher order corrections within the 3D EFT perturbation theory without double counting. Concretely, we compute the Higgs phase sphaleron rate in a semi-classical approximation within the two-loop resummed 3D EFT. We find compact results for the sphaleron rate and the baryon washout factor as well as criteria for the baryon number preservation by providing a clear connection to the results obtained using a similar 3D EFT description for the bubble nucleation. We demonstrate these calculations for the real triplet-extended Standard Model, and conclude that when all two-loop thermal effects for the matching are accounted, no sufficiently strong one-step electroweak phase transitions exist within the parameter space regime that can be mapped onto the 3D EFT we have considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study higher-order QCD corrections beyond NLO for the associated production of a photon with a $W$ boson ($\gamma W^+$ and $\gamma W^-$ production) at the Large Hadron Collider. We calculate the NNLO soft-plus-virtual QCD corrections as well as the N$^3$LO soft-gluon corrections to the total production cross section and the photon transverse-momentum distribution in single-particle-inclusive kinematics. The higher-order corrections provide a significant enhancement to the cross section. This is the first calculation of the complete soft-gluon corrections at N$^3$LO in single-particle-inclusive kinematics for a Standard Model process.</description>

We provide a concise and up-to-date summary of past and recent measurements at lepton and hadron colliders, a discussion of the known perturbative and non-perturbative theoretical ingredients used to provide predictions for the relevant observables, and an overview of future prospects to reduce systematic uncertainties and to compare different measurements in a consistent way.

      <description>arXiv:2506.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper "What can solve the strong CP problem?" goes counter to conventional wisdom by arguing that the universe was in an initial state that combines different eigenstates of $\theta$ (of the theta vacuum of QCD), and asserts that for such an initial state, axionless solutions to the Strong CP Problem based on P and CP symmetries will not work. We discuss the nature of the theta vacuum in light of this work, and find that the conventional framing and solutions based on P and CP symmetries are on a firm footing.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy effects on heavy quark dynamics in Gribov modified gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the momentum distribution of the quark-gluon plasma is anisotropic, leading to instabilities in the system due to chromomagnetic plasma modes. In this work, we consider the anisotropic momentum distribution of the medium constituents to investigate its effects on heavy quark dynamics using the nonperturbative Gribov resummation approach within the framework of the Fokker-Planck equation. Specifically, we study the influence of nonperturbative effects and weak anisotropies on the heavy quark transport coefficients, taking into account the angular dependence between the anisotropy vector and the direction of heavy quark motion. Furthermore, the calculated drag and diffusion coefficients are employed to estimate the energy loss of heavy quarks and the nuclear modification factor, incorporating both elastic collisions and inelastic processes. Our findings indicate that momentum anisotropy, angular dependence, and nonperturbative effects-captured through the scattering amplitudes-play a significant role in determining the transport properties of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Haloscope with a Disordered Dielectric Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light dark matter candidates such as axions and dark photons generically couple to electromagnetism, yielding dark-matter-to-photon conversion as a key search strategy. In addition to resonant conversion in cavities and circuits, light dark matter bosons efficiently convert to photons on material interfaces, with a broadband power proportional to the total area of these interfaces. In this work, we make use of interface conversion to develop a new experimental dark matter detector design: the disordered dielectric detector. We show that a volume filled with dielectric powder is an efficient, robust, and broadband target for axion-to-photon or dark-photon-to-photon conversion. We perform semi-analytical and numerical studies in small-volume 2D and 3D disordered systems to compute the conversion power as a function of dark matter mass. We also discuss the power gathered onto a sensitive photodetector in terms of the bulk properties of the disordered material, making it possible to characterize the predicted dark-matter-to-photon conversion rate across a wide range of wavelengths. Finally, we propose DPHaSE: the Dielectric Powder Haloscope SNSPD Experiment which is composed of a disordered dielectric target, a veto system, and a photon collection chamber to maximize the coupling between the powder target and a low noise superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The projected reach, in the 10 meV-eV mass range, is sensitive to QCD axion-photon couplings and exceeds current constraints on dark photon dark matter by up to 5 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Identifying hyperons in neutron star matter from the slope of the mass-radius diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slope of the neutron star mass radius curve $dM/dR$ determined from two large sets of relativistic mean field equations of state for nucleonic and hyperonic neutron star matter is discussed. It is shown that if the mass-radius curve always has a negative slope the probability that the star has hyperons is very small. A very small probability of the presence of hyperons can already be identified by a negative slope for low-mass stars. A positive slope at $M/M_{\odot} = 1.4$, could indicate the possible presence of hyperons. Nucleonic EoS are found to be more probable than hyperonic ones, given the GW170817 and NICER observation constraints for PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the highest probability is associated with nucleonic stars that originate a mass radius curve with positive slope. Mass-radius curves with a positive slope greater than 1.8$M_\odot$ are not expected to occur. The nuclear matter property that most distinguishes the different scenarios is the curvature of the symmetry energy, with nucleonic EoS with positive slope predicting the highest values that can go above 100 MeV.</description>

      <title>Forecast Constraints on Bouncing Cosmology from High Frequency Gravitational Waves Using Superconducting LC Circuits and Resonant Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit forecast sensitivities to high frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) from superconducting LC circuits, traditional resonant cavity and superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with electromagnetic and mechanical modes to derive the first projections of the bounce energy scale within the generic bouncing cosmology framework over the frequency window $1\,$kHz $\lesssim f\lesssim10\,$GHz. In comparison with existing astrophysical limits (spanning $10^{-17}\,$Hz $\lesssim f\lesssim1\,$kHz and based on Planck/BICEP, PTA, and aLIGO/LISA) our HFGW forecasts yield substantially tighter constraints across a broad region of parameter space. This work unifies constraints from cosmological observations and quantum measurement experiments, providing comprehensive coverage of the early Universe gravitational wave spectrum from $10^{-17}\,\mathrm{Hz}$ to $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ and thereby probing the cosmic initial non singularity at ultra high energy scales.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedup in quantum simulation of Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian via orbifold lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian -- an approach known for its efficiency in simulating SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory and QCD on digital quantum computers -- can reproduce the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian in a controlled limit. While the original Kogut-Susskind approach faces significant implementation challenges on quantum hardware, we show that it emerges naturally as the infinite scalar mass limit of the orbifold lattice formulation, even at finite lattice spacing. Our analysis provides both a general analytical framework applicable to SU($N$) gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions and specific numerical evidence for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) Yang-Mills theories ($N=2,3$). Using Euclidean path integral methods, we quantify the convergence rate by comparing the standard Wilson action with the orbifold lattice action, matching lattice parameters, and systematically extrapolating results as the bare scalar mass approaches infinity. This reformulation resolves longstanding technical obstacles and offers a straightforward implementation protocol for digital quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian with exponential speedup compared to classical methods and previously known quantum methods.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of Energy Constraints for Positrons Generating the Galactic Annihilation Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even 50 years after the discovery of a positron annihilation line from the inner Galaxy, no class of astrophysical sources has emerged as a definitive explanation for both the emission morphology and flux. Positrons produced by dark matter annihilation or decay have been proposed, but the mass of any such candidate is constrained by continuum $\gamma$-ray emission at energies $&gt;511$ keV. Earlier analyses have claimed that this emission requires that the positrons have kinetic energies less than a few MeV at injection, disfavoring both much of the dark matter parameter space and many potential compact astrophysical source classes such as pulsars. However, these constraints were not based on a full forward model of the $\gamma$-ray line and continuum data, and did not marginalize over uncertainties about the relative angular distributions of the line and continuum. Here we describe an improved analysis that overcomes these limitations, and show that constraints on the injection energy are much weaker than previously claimed; even under conservative assumptions the data are consistent with initial energies up to $\sim 50$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Contact potentials in presence of a regular finite-range interaction using dimensional regularization and the $N/D$ method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation (LSE) with a kernel that includes a regular finite-range potential and additional contact terms with derivatives. We employ distorted wave theory and dimensional regularization, as proposed in Physics Letters B 568 (2003) 109. We analyze the spin singlet nucleon-nucleon $S-$wave as case of study, with the regular one-pion exchange (OPE) potential in this partial wave and up to ${\cal O}(Q^6)$ (six derivatives) contact interactions. We discuss in detail the renormalization of the LSE, and show that the scattering amplitude solution of the LSE fulfills exact elastic unitarity and inherits the left-hand cut of the long-distance OPE amplitude. Furthermore, we proof that the LSE amplitude coincides with that obtained from the exact $N/D$ calculation, with the appropriate number and typology of subtractions to reproduce the effective range parameters taken as input to renormalize the LSE amplitude. The generalization to higher number of derivatives is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Curvature with Fast Radio Bursts and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial curvature of the Universe remains a central question in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the potential of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a novel tool to constrain the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ in a cosmological model-independent way. Using a sample of 80 FRBs with known redshifts and dispersion measures, we reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ via artificial neural networks, which is then used to obtain angular diameter distances $D_A(z)$ through two complementary approaches. First, we derive the comoving distance $D_C(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ from FRBs without assuming a fiducial cosmological model. Then, the $H(z)$ reconstruction is combined with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements to infer $D_A(z)$. By comparing the FRB-derived and BAO+FRB-derived $D_A(z)$ values, we extract constraints on $\Omega_k$ under the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. Our results show consistency with a spatially flat Universe within $1\sigma$ uncertainties, although a mild preference for negative curvature is observed across both covariance-based and Gaussian analyses. This study highlights the growing relevance of FRBs in precision cosmology and demonstrates their synergy with BAO data as a powerful probe of the large-scale geometry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>The Exact and Approximate Tales of Boost-Breaking Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators offer a remarkable window into the high-energy physics governing Universe's earliest moments, with the tantalising prospect of discovering new particles. However, extracting new physics from these observables requires both precise theoretical predictions of inflationary theories and accurate, analytical templates suitable for data analysis throughout parameter and kinematic spaces. In this paper, we extend the current analytical results by computing the most general boost-breaking seed correlator mediated by the tree-level exchange of a massive spinning particle. We derive the result using two complementary approaches, bootstrapping from boundary differential equations, and direct spectral integration. Both representations are packaged as a single partially resummed series that converges in all physical kinematics. Computing this correlator marks a milestone for carving out the space of all boost-breaking correlators, and therefore completes the tree-level catalogue. We then introduce a general procedure to obtain accurate approximations for cosmological collider signals based on the saddle-point method. This approach allows for a clear physical intuition of various signals hidden in correlators, as the bulk physics is made manifest through the location of these saddles in the complex time plane, which depend on the external kinematics. Evaluating the time integrals at these saddles yields results given as elementary functions that remain valid beyond soft limits and provide intuitive control over both the signal shape and amplitude. We demonstrate the power of this method in both de Sitter-invariant and boost-breaking scenarios, and uncover novel refined waveform and strength dependence for oscillatory signals from massive fields. We provide a complete cosmological collider shape template capturing all boost-breaking effects for upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Anomalous non-thermal fixed point in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of distinctly sub-diffusive scaling in the vicinity of an anomalous non-thermal fixed point is discussed in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas in the superfluid phase, carrying ensembles of vortices and antivortices with zero net angular momentum. The observed scaling behavior reflects coarsening dynamics driven by the mutual annihilation of vortices and antivortices, with the mean inter-defect distance growing algebraically over time as $\ell_\text{v}(t)\sim t^{\,\beta}$. A sub-diffusive ($\beta&lt;1/2$) exponent $\beta\approx0.2$ is extracted for various parameter regimes, initial conditions, and dipolar configurations from both scaling occupation-number spectra and the evolution of inter-defect distances as well as the corresponding total vortex densities. As vortex-antivortex annihilation progresses, excitations of the background condensate increase. This gives rise to a transition in the scaling behavior at late times, toward a non-thermal fixed point governed by diffusion-type scaling with $\beta\approx1/2$ as expected for the mutual annihilation of well-separated vortex-antivortex dipoles. While the temporal scaling with $\beta$ does not depend significantly on the strength and anisotropy of the dipolar interactions and thus underlines the universality of the anomalous as well as diffusion-type non-thermal fixed points, we find distinctly different vortex patterns resulting in the dipolar case. While in the superfluid with contact interactions only, same-sign vortices tend to cluster and form large-scale eddies, in the dipolar and tilted cases, roton excitations appear to prevent such motion, giving rather rise to a maximisation of distances between vortices of either sign.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the analysis of the gauge-invariant decomposition of amplitudes in spontaneously broken massive gauge theories by providing a characterization of separately gauge-invariant subsectors for amplitudes involving trilinear interaction vertices for an Abelian theory with chiral fermions. We show that the use of Frohlich-Morchio-Strocchi gauge-invariant dynamical (i.e. propagating inside loops) fields yields a very powerful handle on the cancellations among unphysical degrees of freedom (the longitudinal mode of the massive gauge field, the Goldstone scalar and the ghosts). The resulting cancellations are encoded into separately Slavnov-Taylor invariant sectors for 1-PI amplitudes. The construction works to all orders in perturbation theory. This decomposition suggests a novel strategy for the determination of finite counter-terms required to restore the Slavnov-Taylor identities in chiral theories in the absence of an invariant regularization scheme.</description>

Abstract: $\texttt{HEPfit}$ is a flexible open-source tool which, given the Standard Model or any of its extensions, allows to $\textit{i)}$ fit the model parameters to a given set of experimental observables; $\textit{ii)}$ obtain predictions for observables. $\texttt{HEPfit}$ can be used either in Monte Carlo mode, to perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of a given model, or as a library, to obtain predictions of observables for a given point in the parameter space of the model, allowing $\texttt{HEPfit}$ to be used in any statistical framework. In the present version, around a thousand observables have been implemented in the Standard Model and in several new physics scenarios. In this paper, we describe the general structure of the code as well as models and observables implemented in the current release.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight dark photons are compelling dark matter candidates, but their allowed kinetic mixing with the Standard Model photon is severely constrained by requiring that the dark photons do not collapse into a cosmic string network in the early Universe. Direct detection in minimal production scenarios for dark photon dark matter is strongly limited, if not entirely excluded; discovery of sub-meV dark photon dark matter would therefore point to a nonminimal dark sector. We describe a model that evades such constraints, capable of producing cold dark photons in any parameter space accessible to future direct detection experiments. The associated production dynamics yield additional signatures in cosmology and small-scale structure, allowing for possible positive identification of this particular class of production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Flavor composition of supernova neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the flavor composition of neutrinos from supernovae is a challenging task, primarily due to the high neutrino densities at their core. In such an environment, neutrino self-interactions give rise to collective effects that have dramatic yet poorly understood consequences for their flavor evolution. In this paper, however, we show that standard matter effects in the outer layers of supernovae can significantly constrain the flavor composition of the neutrino flux. We assume that, since a large number of neutrinos undergo different evolutions within the core, their state upon entering the MSW-dominated region is affected by decoherence. This assumption simplifies the problem and suggests that the fraction of neutrinos with electron flavor reaching Earth, denoted as $f_{\nu_e}$, is constrained to be less than $0.5$ for all energies throughout the emission phase in the case of normal mass ordering. In contrast, for inverted mass ordering, we anticipate neutrinos arriving in near flavor equipartition ($f_{\nu_e} \approx 1/3$). These predictions, and consequently their underlying assumptions, could be tested by future observations and may provide valuable insights into the properties of neutrino fluxes emerging from supernovae.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-leptonic puzzle of $B_{d(s)} \rightarrow K^{(\ast)}\bar{K}^{(\ast)}$ decay in the $R$-parity violating minimal supersymmetric standard model (RPV-MSSM) extended with the inverse seesaw mechanism. In this model, the chiral flip of sneutrinos can contribute to the observables $L_{K\bar{K}}$ and $L_{K^{\ast}\bar{K}^{\ast}}$, that is benefit for explaining the relevant puzzle. We also find that this unique effect can engage in the $B_s$-$\bar{B}_s$ mixing. We utilize the scenario of complex $\lambda^\prime$ couplings to fulfill the recent stringent constraint of $B_s$-$\bar{B}_s$ mixing, and examine other related bounds of $B,K$-meson decays, lepton decays, neutrino data, $Z$ decays, oblique parameters, CP violations (CPV), etc. Besides, inspired by the new measurement of ${\cal B}(B^+ \rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ by Belle II, which shows about $2.7\sigma$ higher than the Standard Model (SM) prediction, we also investigate the New Physics (NP) enhancement to this observable.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight dark photon dark matter features distinctive cosmological and astrophysical signatures and is also supported by a burgeoning direct-detection program searching for its kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon over a wide mass range. Dark photons, however, cannot necessarily constitute the dark matter in all of this parameter space. In minimal models where the dark photon mass arises from a dark Higgs mechanism, early-Universe dynamics can easily breach the regime of validity of the low-energy effective theory for a massive vector field. In the process, the dark sector can collapse into a cosmic string network, precluding dark photons as viable dark matter. We establish the general conditions under which dark photon production avoids significant backreaction on the dark Higgs and identify regions of parameter space that naturally circumvent these constraints. After surveying implications for known dark photon production mechanisms, we propose novel models that set well-motivated experimental targets across much of the accessible parameter space. We also discuss complementary cosmological and astrophysical signatures that can probe the dark sector physics responsible for dark photon production.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Electroweakino Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The system of light electroweakinos and heavy squarks gives rise to one of the most challenging signatures to detect at the LHC. It consists of missing transverse energy recoiled against a few hadronic jets originating either from QCD radiation or squark decays. The analysis generally suffers from the large irreducible Z + jets $(Z \to \nu \bar \nu)$ background. In this study, we explore Machine Learning (ML) methods for efficient signal/background discrimination. Our best attempt uses both reconstructed (jets, missing transverse energy, etc.) and low-level (particle-flow) objects. We find that the discrimination performance improves as the pT threshold for soft particles is lowered from 10 GeV to 1 GeV, at the expense of larger systematic uncertainty. In many cases, the ML method provides a factor two enhancement in $S/\sqrt{(S + B)}$ from a simple kinematical selection. The sensitivity on the squark-elecroweakino mass plane is derived with this method, assuming the Run-3 and HL-LHC luminosities. Moreover, we investigate the relations between input features and the network's classification performance to reveal the physical information used in the background/signal discrimination process.</description>

      <title>How to Falsify String Theory at a Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string landscape accommodates a broad range of possible effective field theories. This poses a challenge for extracting verifiable predictions as well as falsifiable signatures of string theory. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we observe that all known stringy Standard Models support only low-dimensional representations of the gauge group. While it is in principle possible to produce contrived models with higher-dimensional representations, these generically appear in a tower of states with lighter ones in lower-dimensional representations, i.e., not in isolation. With this in mind, we consider the phenomenologically well-motivated scenario given by adding a single Majorana field in a real, $n$-dimensional representation of $SU(2)_L$ with $n \geq 5$ \textit{and nothing else}. This scenario is not realized in any known string construction, and we conjecture that this is true of string theory in general. Detection of this scenario would thus amount to falsifying the (known) string landscape. We recast existing LHC searches for new electroweak states to extract updated bounds on this class of scenarios. Improved limits from future colliders and dark matter detection experiments provide additional routes to potentially falsifying string theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the electron-positron to muon--anti-muon cross-section in the asymptotically safe Standard Model. In particular, we include the graviton contributions to the scattering amplitude, which is computed from momentum-dependent timelike one-particle-irreducible correlation functions. Specifically, we employ reconstruction techniques for the graviton spectral functions. We find that the full asymptotically safe quantum cross section decreases in the ultraviolet with the centre-of-mass energy, and is compatible with unitarity bounds. Importantly, our findings provide non-trivial evidence for the unitarity of the asymptotically safe Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Zee model in a non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ flavor symmetry in which we find good predictions in both the cases of normal and inverted hierarchy. Parameter reduction on neutrino sector occurs due to large mass hierarchies between charged-leptons mass eigenvalues and new singly-charged bosons in addition to this flavor symmetry. As a result, we have two complex free parameters including modulus $\tau$. We show several predictions in terms of verifiable observables such as Dirac CP, Majorana phases, sum of the neutrino masses, and the effective mass for neutrino double beta decay in addition to demonstrating allowed regions for our input parameters.</description>

      <title>Constraining eV-scale axion-like particle dark matter: insights from the M87 Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can account for the observed dark matter (DM) of the Universe and if their masses are at the eV scale, they can decay into infrared, optical and ultraviolet photons with a decay lifetime larger than the age of the Universe.We analyze multi-wavelength data obtained from the central region of Messier 87 (M87) galaxy by several telescopes, such as, Swift, Astrosat, Kanata, Spitzer and International Ultraviolet Explorer in the infrared to ultraviolet frequencies ($\sim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm Hz} - 3\times10^{15}$ Hz), to constrain the narrow emission lines indicative of the eV scale ALP DM decay. We derive constraints on the ALP coupling to two photons ($g_{a\gamma\gamma}$) for ALP mass range $2 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$, assuming ALPs form the DM in the M87 halo. We find that our bounds on ALP-two-photon coupling can become stronger than the existing ones by an order of magnitude in the ALP mass range $8 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>Tensor meson transition form factors in holographic QCD and the muon $g-2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the prominence of tensor mesons in photon-photon collisions, until recently their contribution to the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been estimated to be at the level of only a few $10^{-12}$. A recent reanalysis within the dispersive approach has found that after resolving the issue of kinematic singularities in previous approaches, a larger result is obtained, a few $10^{-11}$, and with opposite sign as in previous results, when a simple quark model for the transition form factors is employed. In this paper, we present the first complete evaluation of tensor meson contributions within a hard-wall model in holographic QCD, which reproduces surprisingly well mass, two-photon width, and the observed singly virtual transition form factors of the dominant $f_2(1270)$. Due to a second structure function that is absent in the quark model and in lowest-order resonance chiral theory, the result for $a_\mu$ turns out to be positive instead of negative, and also with a magnitude of a few $10^{-11}$. We find that the infinite tower of tensor mesons permits to fill the gap in the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint on the HLbL amplitude left by the contribution of axial vector mesons. Matching the corresponding leading-order OPE result leads to two-photon couplings consistent with the observed combined effects of the ground-state $f_2,a_2,f_2'$ multiplet and a total $a_\mu^\mathrm{Tensor}$ contribution of $+12.4\times 10^{-11}$; with an $F_\rho$ fit this is reduced slightly to $+11.1\times 10^{-11}$. A contribution of this size from the tensor sector could explain the tension between the most recent dispersive and lattice results for $a_\mu^\mathrm{HLbL}$.</description>

      <title>Complete analytical solution to the Cornell potential and heavy quarkonium structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the recently proposed supersymmetric expansion algorithm (SEA) to obtain a complete analytical solution to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the Cornell potential. We find that the energy levels $E_{nl}(\lambda)$ depend on $n^{2}$ and $L^{2}=l(l+1)$. For a given $n$, the energy {\emph {decreases}} with $l$ and the radial probabilities have the Coulomb shape but their peaks are shifted toward smaller radius. We study the heavy quarkonium structure on the light of these results, showing that the measured $\bar{b}b$ and $\bar{c}c$ meson masses follow the inverted spectrum pattern predicted by the Cornell potential. Details of the structure of heavy quarkonium like the mean inverse radius and mean squared velocity for the different quarkonium configurations can be obtained from our solution. These details point to significant relativistic corrections for all the configurations of real heavy quarkonium. We calculate relativistic corrections using perturbation theory finding an expansion in $\alpha^{2}_{s}$ for the heavy quarkonium masses. The mass hierarchies in the fine splittings can be qualitatively understood from this expansion. The quantitative analysis of the Bohr-like levels and of the fine splittings in the $l=0$ sector allow us to make well defined predictions for the masses of some of the missing heavy quarkonium states, to identify the $\psi(4040)$ as the $3^{3}S_{1}$ $\bar{c}c$ state and the $\psi(3842)$, $\psi(3823)$ and $\psi(3770)$ as the $3^{3}D_{3}$, $3^{3}D_{2}$ and $3^{3}D_{1}$ $\bar{c}c$ states respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A combined constraint on the QCD equation of state, at high densities, from connecting neutron star observations to data from heavy ion reactions is presented. We use the Chiral Mean Field Model which can describe neutron star and iso-spin symmetric matter and allows the consistent calculation of the density and momentum dependent potentials of baryons which are then implemented in the UrQMD transport model. In contrast to previous studies, the same equation of state constrained from neutron star properties is also able to describe experimental observables in heavy ion reactions at the HADES experiment. Unlike many other approaches our results are not constraint to densities up to nuclear saturation or perturbative results which allows a continuous description of the equation of state over a large range in baryon density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generating set of reparametrization invariants that can be constructed from the couplings and masses entering the scalar potential of the general Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). Being independent of higgs-basis rotations, they generate a polynomial ring of basis invariants that represent the physical content of the model. Ignoring for the moment gauge and Yukawa interactions, we derive six-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for all the invariants entering the set. We do not compute a single Feynman diagram but rely heavily on the general RGE results for scalar theories. We use linear algebra together with techniques from Invariant Theory. The latter not only allow one to compute the number of linearly independent invariants entering beta functions at a certain loop order (via Hilbert series) but also provide a convenient tool for dealing with polynomial relations (so-called syzygies) between invariants from the generating set.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino slow flavor evolution. Part II. Space-time evolution of linear instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slow flavor evolution (defined as driven by neutrino masses and not necessarily ``slow'') is receiving fresh attention in the context of compact astrophysical environments. In Part~I of this series, we have studied the slow-mode dispersion relation following our recently developed analogy to plasma waves. The concept of resonance between flavor waves in the linear regime and propagating neutrinos is the defining feature of this approach. It is best motivated for weak instabilities, which probably is the most relevant regime in self-consistent astrophysical environments because these will try to eliminate the cause of instability. We here go beyond the dispersion relation alone (which by definition applies to infinite media) and consider the group velocities of unstable modes that determines whether the instability relaxes within the region where it first appears (absolute), or away from it (convective). We show that all weak instabilities are convective so that their further evolution is not local. Therefore, studying their consequences numerically in small boxes from given initial conditions may not always be appropriate.</description>

Abstract: We study QCD at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential to derive the critical temperature at the chiral phase transition (crossover). We solve a set of Dyson--Schwinger partial differential equations using the exact solution for the Yang--Mills quantum field theory based on elliptical functions. We derive a Nambu-Jona--Lasino (NJL) model of the quarks and obtain a very good agreement with recent lattice computations regarding the dependence of the critical temperature on the strong coupling scale. The solution depends on a single scale parameter, as typical for the theory and already known from studies about asymptotic freedom. The study is analytically derived from QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective oscillations in dense neutrino gases (flavor waves) are notable for their instabilities that cause fast flavor conversion. We develop a quantum theory of interacting neutrinos and flavor wave quanta, which are analogous to plasmons, but also carry flavor. The emission or absorption of such flavor plasmons $\psi$, or flavomons, changes the neutrino flavor. When an angular crossing occurs, the process $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e+\psi$ is more rapid than its inverse along the direction of the crossing, triggering stimulated $\psi$ emission and fast instability. Calculating the rate via Feynman diagrams matches the fast instability growth rate. Our novel $\nu$ and $\psi$ kinetic equations, corresponding to quasi-linear theory, describe instability evolution without resolving the small scales of the flavomon wavelength, potentially overcoming the main challenge of fast flavor evolution.</description>

Abstract: We perform analysis of the small x non-linear evolution equation formulated in momentum space supplemented by higher order terms. The equation is defined in wide range of transverse momentum and longitudinal momentum fraction extending previous studies performed in \cite{Kutak:2003bd,Kutak:2004ym}. The linear part of the equation is motivated by the renormalization group improved small x approach which accounts for resummation of higher orders, and includes collinear splitting function and kinematical constraint. The solution to the equation is then used to perform the fit to Deep Inelastic Scattering reduced cross section data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework describing single pion resonant production through inelastic dark fermion-nucleon interactions mediated by resonances in the GeV-scale regime. Building upon the Rein-Sehgal approach, we derive differential cross sections for processes in which an incoming dark fermion scatters off a nucleon, exciting a resonance that subsequently decays into a nucleon and a pion. Our formulation accommodates various mediator types-namely, dark photons with vector and axial couplings, as well as scalar and pseudoscalar mediators-thereby extending the conventional approach that Rein, Sehgal and Berger performed for neutrino interactions. Transition amplitudes for the nucleon-to-resonance conversion are computed using the relativistic harmonic-oscillator quark model from Feynman, Kislinger and Ravndal, while a Breit-Wigner prescription is employed to incorporate finite resonance widths. This framework offers a robust tool for interpreting experimental data in dark sector and matter searches and represents a contribution to elucidate the role of resonances in GeV-scale phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Two-loop light-quark Electroweak corrections to Higgs boson pair production in gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute two-loop electroweak corrections to double Higgs boson production in gluon fusion mediated by light quarks in a fully analytical way. We determine a basis of master integrals satisfying canonical differential equations in $\mathrm{d}\log$ form, enhanced by subsequent rotations to remove unnecessary functions that do not appear in the analytic expressions of the amplitudes. We determine the integration constants by matching our expressions to the large mass expansion limit of the canonical integrals. We express the solution of differential equations in terms of Chen iterated integrals up to transcendental weight six over logarithmic kernels with algebraic arguments, and further decompose them by employing a basis of uniform weight functions. By deriving differential equations for such basis, we provide numerical results as well as routines for optimised numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Light quark energy loss in the flavor-dependent systems from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the holographic model of finite-endpoint-momentum shooting string approach, we study the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks for the flavor-dependent systems with $N_f = 0$, $N_f = 2$, and $N_f = 2+1$ in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) framework. In particular, we investigate for the first time the impact of the flavor content of the strongly coupled QGP medium on the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks. It turns out that the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks is smallest for $N_f = 0$, and adding $u(d)$ quarks and $s$ quark in the system increases this energy loss. In addition, we found that the instantaneous energy loss in the strongly coupled plasma is minimal near the critical temperature, but it increases as the system moves away from the critical endpoint due to rising temperature or chemical potential.</description>

Abstract: Is there a Hierarchy Problem? If so, what, exactly, is the problem? Almost every theorist has a personal answer to these questions. In this article, I give my answers. I will explain that the Hierarchy Problem is not a formal problem but rather our ignorance of a crucial physics explanation -- the explanation of the nature of the Higgs boson. Without the solution to this problem, we cannot make progress on the major questions of our field.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in an Evanescent Three-Brane Randall-Sundrum Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Apart from its gravitational interactions, dark matter (DM) has remained so far elusive in laboratory searches. One possible explanation is that the relevant interactions to explain its relic abundance are mainly gravitational. In this work we consider an extradimensional Randall-Sundrum scenario with a TeV-PeV IR brane, where the Standard Model is located, and a GeV-TeV deep IR (DIR) one, where the DM lies. When the curvatures of the bulk to the left and right of the IR brane are very similar, the tension of the IR brane is significantly smaller than that of the other two branes, and therefore we term it \evanescent". In this setup, the relic abundance of DM arises from the freezeout mechanism, thanks to DM annihilations into radions and gravitons. Focusing on a scalar singlet DM candidate, we compute and apply current and future constraints from direct, indirect and collider-based searches. Our findings demonstrate the viability of this scenario and highlight its potential testability in upcoming experiments. We also discuss the possibility of inferring the number of branes if the radion and several Kaluza-Klein graviton resonances are detected at a future collider.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation of the neutrino plasma: Unifying fast, slow, and collisional instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In neutrino-dense astrophysical environments, these particles exchange flavor through a coherent weak field, forming a collisionless neutrino plasma with collective flavor dynamics. Instabilities, which grow and affect the environment, may arise from neutrino-neutrino refraction alone (fast limit), vacuum energy splittings caused by masses (slow limit), or neutrino-matter scattering (collisional limit). We present a comprehensive analytical description of the dispersion relation governing these unstable modes. Treating vacuum energy splittings and collision rates as small perturbations, we construct a unified framework for fast, slow, and collisional instabilities. We classify modes into gapped, where collective excitations are already present in the fast limit but rendered unstable by slow or collisional effects, and gapless, which are purely generated by these effects. For each class, we derive approximate dispersion relations for generic energy and angle distributions, which reveal the order of magnitude of the growth rates and the nature of the instabilities without solving directly the dispersion relation. This approach confirms that slow and collisionally unstable waves generally grow much more slowly than they oscillate. Consequently, the common fast-mode approximation of local evolution within small boxes is unjustified. Even for fast modes, neglecting large-distance propagation of growing waves, as usually done, may be a poor approximation. Our unified framework provides an intuitive understanding of the linear phase of flavor evolution across all regimes and paves the way for a quasi-linear treatment of the instability's nonlinear development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been claimed in a number of publications that neutrinos can exhibit chirality oscillations. In this note we discuss the notion of chirality and show that chiral neutrino oscillations in vacuum do not occur. We argue that the incorrect claims to the contrary resulted from a failure to clearly discriminate between quantum fields, states and wave functions. We also emphasize the role played in the erroneous claims on the possibility of chirality oscillations by the widely spread misconceptions about negative energies.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Single Species Hidden Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmology and astrophysics provide various ways to study the properties of dark matter even if they have negligible non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model particles and remain hidden. We study a type of hidden dark matter model in which the dark matter is completely decoupled from the Standard Model sector except gravitationally, and consists of a single species with conserved comoving particle number and conserved comoving entropy. This category of hidden dark matter includes models that act as warm dark matter but is more general. In particular, in addition to having an independent temperature from the Standard Model sector, it includes cases in which dark matter is in its own kinetic equilibrium or is free-streaming, obeys fermionic or bosonic statistics, and processes a chemical potential that controls the particle occupation number. While the usual parameterization using the free-streaming scale or the particle mass no longer applies, we show that all cases can be well approximated by a set of functions parameterized by only one parameter as long as the chemical potential is nonpositive: the characteristic scale factor at the time of the relativistic-to-nonrelativistic transition. We study the constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, and the smallest halo mass. We show that the most significant phenomenological impact is the suppression of the small-scale matter power spectrum -- a typical feature when the dark matter has a velocity dispersion or pressure at early times. So far, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and the small dark matter halo population provide the strongest constraints, limiting the transition redshift to be larger than $\sim6.2\times10^7$.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the ideas of resurgence and Pad\'{e}-Borel resummation in the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian of scalar quantum electrodynamics, which has remained largely unexamined in these contexts. We thereby extend the related seminal works in spinor quantum electrodynamics, while contrasting the similarities and differences in the two cases. We investigate in detail the efficacy of resurgent extrapolations starting from just a finite number of terms in the weak-field expansions of the 1-loop and 2-loop scalar quantum electrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. While we re-derive some of the well-known 1-loop and 2-loop contributions in representations suitable for Pad\'{e}-Borel analyses, other contributions have been derived for the first time. For instance, we find a closed analytic form for the one-particle reducible contribution at 2-loop, which until recently was thought to be zero. It is pointed out that there could be an interesting interplay between the one-particle irreducible and one-particle reducible terms in the strong-field limit. The 1-loop scalar electrodynamics contribution may be effectively mapped into two copies of the spinor quantum electrodynamics, and the particle reducible contribution may be mapped to the 1-loop contribution. It is suggested that these mappings cannot be trivially used to map the corresponding resurgent structures. The singularity structures in the Pad\'{e}-Borel transforms at 1-loop and 2-loop are examined in some detail. Analytic continuation to the electric field case and the generation of an imaginary part is also studied. We compare the Pad\'{e}-Borel reconstructions to closed analytic forms or to numerically computed values in the full theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02245v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We also check their sensitivity to resonance decay and hadronic interactions. We demonstrate that while some of these observables are more sensitive to transport properties than traditional flow observables, others are less sensitive, making them suitable for studying different stages of the evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term, and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of supersymmetric Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) models with multiple U(1) symmetries and Standard Model (SM) singlets inspired by heterotic string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The string-theoretic origin imposes a particular charge pattern on the SM fields and FN singlets, dividing the latter into perturbative and non-perturbative types. Employing systematic and heuristic search strategies, such as genetic algorithms, we identify charge assignments and singlet VEVs that replicate the observed mass and mixing hierarchies in the quark sector, and subsequently refine the Yukawa matrix coefficients to accurately match the observed values for the Higgs VEV, the quark and charged lepton masses and the CKM matrix. This bottom-up approach complements top-down string constructions and our results demonstrate that string FN models possess a sufficiently rich structure to account for flavour physics. On the other hand, the limited number of distinct viable charge patterns identified here indicates that flavour physics imposes tight constraints on string theory models, adding new constraints on particle spectra that are essential for achieving a realistic phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we analyse the DESI BAO data jointly with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ or Dark Energy Survey supernovae data, and find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of time-domain astronomy and the game-changing next generation of telescopes, we have unprecedented opportunities to explore the most energetic events in our Universe through electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, and neutrinos. These are elementary particles, which exist in three different flavors and change the latter as they propagate in the dense core of astrophysical sources as well as en route to Earth. To capitalize on existing and upcoming multi-messenger opportunities, it is crucial to understand: 1. the role of neutrinos in explosive transient sources as well as in the synthesis of the elements heavier than iron; 2. the impact of neutrino physics on the multi-messenger observables; 3. the information on the source physics carried by the detectable neutrino signal. In this review, the status of this exciting and fast-moving field is outlined, focusing on astrophysical sources linked to collapsing massive stars and neutron-star mergers. In light of the upcoming plethora of multi-messenger data, outstanding open issues concerning the optimization of multi-messenger detection strategies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of spacetime geometry on neutrino oscillation inside a Core-Collapse Supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are excellent probes of the inner structures of supernovas. However, an understanding of their dynamics remains incomplete, which is crucial for properly interpreting the detector data. The huge matter density inside a core collapse supernova affects the self-coupling of the neutrinos through a geometrical four-fermion interaction induced by spacetime torsion generated by the fermions themselves. For normal mass hierarchy, the effect is negligible; for inverted mass hierarchy however, we find that the gravitational coupling can significantly alter the flavor dynamics. The possibility of constraining the said interactions through the relative abundance of different flavors of the neutrinos is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More than a decade ago, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory discovered a diffuse flux of 10 TeV-10 PeV neutrinos from our Universe. This flux of unknown origin most likely emanates from an extragalactic population of neutrino sources, which are individually too faint to appear as bright emitters. We review constraints on extragalactic neutrino source populations based on the non-detection of the brightest neutrino source. Extending previous work, we discuss limitations of source populations based on general neutrino luminosity functions. Our method provides more conservative but also statistically more robust predictions for the expected number of observable sources. We also show that the combined search of the brightest neutrino sources via weighted stacking searches or the analysis of non-Poissonian fluctuations in event-count histograms can improve the discovery potential by a factor of 2-3 relative to the brightest source.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of the black hole photon ring as a probe of ultralight dilaton fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have facilitated unprecedented probing of superradiant phenomena in the vicinities of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), establishing an ideal laboratory to detect ultralight bosons beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we delve into how ultralight dilaton clouds, formed via SMBH superradiance, impact the black hole photon rings. Our focus is on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling term of the form $f(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. By integrating geometric optics with plasma refractive effects in accretion environments, we demonstrate that the dilaton cloud dynamically alters the plasma frequency. Through systematic ray-tracing simulations covering a range of photon frequencies and dilaton coupling strengths, we reveal a photon ring oscillation that follows the period of that of the dilaton field. As the dilaton mass increases, this oscillation becomes suppressed due to the washout effect of the dilaton-induced correction term over the light path integration. We further evaluated the observability of such dilaton-induced photon ring oscillations with current radio interferometric capabilities. Our estimates indicate that this effect could potentially constrain the dilaton-photon coupling to $g_{\phi\gamma}\lesssim 10^{-11}\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for dilaton masses $\mu \lesssim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>A Perturbatively Stable Non-Supersymmetric String Model with AdS Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of a perturbatively stable non-supersymmetric type II closed string model in four dimensions. It is based on a freely acting Scherk-Schwarz Z2-deformation of a supersymmetric construction which is recovered in appropriate decompactification limits. The model exhibits also the so-called misaligned supersymmetry with alternating signs for the number difference between bosons and fermions at successive mass levels. The tree-level spectrum is tachyon free for any value of the radii and moduli. At one loop level, the scalar potential has a non-supersymmetric minimum at the self-dual (free fermionic) point with negative energy, around which all tree-level massless scalars acquire positive masses. The model is thus non-supersymmetric and perturbatively stable.</description>

      <title>JFlow: Model-Independent Spherical Jeans Analysis using Equivariant Continuous Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kinematics of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been studied to understand the structure of dark matter halos. However, the kinematic information of these stars is often limited to celestial positions and line-of-sight velocities, making full phase space analysis challenging. Conventional methods rely on projected analytic phase space density models with several parameters and infer dark matter halo structures by solving the spherical Jeans equation. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning method for solving the spherical Jeans equation in a model-independent way as a first step toward model-independent analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using equivariant continuous normalizing flows, we demonstrate that spherically symmetric stellar phase space densities and velocity dispersions can be estimated without model assumptions. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to Gaia challenge datasets for spherical models and measure dark matter mass densities for given velocity anisotropy profiles. Our method can identify halo structures accurately, even with a small number of tracer stars.</description>

      <title>Summary Report of the Physics Beyond Colliders Study at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Physics Beyond Collider (PBC) Study Group was initially mandated by the CERN Management to prepare the previous European Particle Physics Strategy Update for CERN projects other than the high-energy frontier colliders. The main findings were summarized in an PBC Summary Report submitted to the Strategy Update. Following the Update process, the PBC Study Group was confirmed on a permanent basis with an updated mandate taking into account the strategy recommendations. The Study Group is now in charge of supporting the proponents of new ideas to address the technical issues and physics motivation of the projects ahead of their review by the CERN Scientific Committees and decision by the Management. The present document updates the previous PBC summary report to inform the new ongoing European Particle Physics Strategy Update process, taking into account the evolution of the CERN and worldwide landscapes and the new projects under consideration within the Study Group.</description>
