      <title>Higher Groups and Higher Normality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue Prasma's homotopical group theory program by considering homotopy normal maps in arbitrary $\infty$-topoi. We show that maps of group objects equipped with normality data, in Prasma's sense, are algebras for a "normal closure" monad in a way which generalizes the standard loops-suspension monad. We generalize a result of Prasma by showing that monoidal functors of $\infty$-topoi preserve normal maps or, equivalently, that monoidal functors of $\infty$-topoi preserve the property of "being a fiber" for morphisms between connected objects. We also formulate Noether's Isomorphism Theorems in this setting, prove the first of them, and provide counterexamples to the other two. Accomplishing these goals requires us to spend substantial time synthesizing existing work of Lurie so that we may rigorously talk about group objects in $\infty$-topoi in the "usual way." One nice result of this labor is the formulation and proof of an Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem for group actions in $\infty$-topoi.</description>

      <title>Pointed Quandle Coloring Quivers of Linkoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We enhance the pointed quandle counting invariant of linkoids through the use of quivers analogously to quandle coloring quivers. This allows us to generalize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids. Additionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree quiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers of linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.</description>

      <title>Coproduct idempotent algebras over internal operads in enriched $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:1712.00555, H. Heine shows that given a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$ and a weakly $\mathcal{V}$-enriched monad $T$ over an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, then there is an induced action of $\mathcal{V}$ on $LMod_T(\mathcal{C})$. Moreover, properties like tensoring or enrichment can be transferred from the action on $\mathcal{C}$ to that on $LMod_T(\mathcal{C})$. We see that the action of an internal operad $O \in Alg(sSeq(\mathcal{C}))$ can be interpreted as the action of a monad $T_O$, such that $Alg_O(\mathcal{C})\cong LMod_{T_O}(\mathcal{C})$. We can then prove that, under a presentability assumption, if the category $\mathcal{C}$ admits cotensors with respect to the action of $\mathcal{V}$, then so does $Alg_O(\mathcal{C})\cong LMod_{T_O}(\mathcal{C})$. This is used to show that the coproduct-idempotent algebras are fixed by the induced tensoring action. We apply this to the stable motivic homotopy category and prove that the tensor of any motivic sphere with rational motivic cohomology is equivalent to the latter.</description>

      <title>On invariants of foliated sphere bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morita showed that for each power of the Euler class, there are examples of flat $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundles for which the power of the Euler class does not vanish. Haefliger asked if the same holds for flat odd-dimensional sphere bundles. In this paper, for a manifold $M$ with a free torus action, we prove that certain $M$-bundles are cobordant to a flat $M$-bundle and as a consequence, we answer Haefliger's question. We show that the powers of the Euler class and Pontryagin classes $p_i$ for $i\leq n-1$ are all non-trivial in $H^*(\text{BDiff}^{\delta}_+(\mathbb{S}^{2n-1});\mathbb{Q})$. In the appendix, Nils Prigge corrects a claim by Haefliger about the vanishing of certain classes in the smooth group cohomology of $\text{Diff}_+(\mathbb{S}^3)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study unital $\infty$-operads by their arity restrictions. Given $k \geq 1$, we develop a model for unital $k$-restricted $\infty$-operads, which are variants of $\infty$-operads which has only $(\leq k)$-arity morphisms, as complete Segal presheaves on closed $k$-dendroidal trees, which are closed trees build from corollas with valences $\leq k$. Furthermore, we prove that the restriction functors from unital $\infty$-operads to unital $k$-restricted $\infty$-operads admit fully faithful left and right adjoints by showing that the left and right Kan extensions preserve complete Segal objects. Varying $k$, the left and right adjoints give a filtration and a co-filtration for any unital $\infty$-operads by $k$-restricted $\infty$-operads.</description>

      <title>Topological symmetry in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for internal topological symmetries in quantum field theory, including "noninvertible symmetries" and "categorical symmetries". This leads to a calculus of topological defects which takes full advantage of well-developed theorems and techniques in topological field theory. Our discussion focuses on finite symmetries, and we give indications for a generalization to other symmetries. We treat quotients and quotient defects (often called "gauging" and "condensation defects"), finite electromagnetic duality, and duality defects, among other topics. We include an appendix on finite homotopy theories, which are often used to encode finite symmetries and for which computations can be carried out using methods of algebraic topology. Throughout we emphasize exposition and examples over a detailed technical treatment.</description>

      <title>Foundation of Floer homotopy theory I: Flow categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a stable infinity category with objects flow categories and morphisms flow bimodules; our construction has many flavors, related to a choice of bordism theory, and we discuss in particular framed bordism and the bordism theory of complex oriented derived orbifolds. In this setup, the construction of homotopy types associated to Floer-theoretic data is immediate: the moduli spaces of solutions to Floer's equation assemble into a flow category with respect to the appropriate bordism theory, and the associated Floer homotopy types arise as suitable mapping spectra in this category. The definition of these mapping spectra is sufficiently explicit to allow a direct interpretation of the Floer homotopy groups as Floer bordism groups. In the setting of framed bordism, we show that the category we construct is a model for the category of spectra. We implement the construction of Floer homotopy types in this new formalism for the case of Hamiltonian Floer theory.</description>
