      <title>Noise-Affected Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of uncorrelated noise on dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a quantum ramp across critical points in two different scenarios. First, we show that for a slow ramp in the XY model caused by a stochastically driven field an intriguing and counterintuitive phenomenon arises where the Loschmidt amplitude vanishes in an entire critical region in time. At the boundaries of such a region, DQPTs in the return rate with diverging slopes appear in contrast to the regular DQPTs with finite slopes for a ramp without noise. We also show that the critical ramp velocity beyond which DQPTs disappear entirely, as well as the critical ramp velocity separating the regime with critical regions in time from the regime with standard DQPTs, are both described by universal scaling functions. Second, we study the impact of the environment on DQPTs based on the Kubo-Anderson spectral diffusion process, where the environmental effects on the system are simulated as stochastic fluctuations in the energy levels of the post-ramp Hamiltonian. In this framework, the noise master equation can be solved analytically both for uncorrelated and correlated noise. The obtained analytical expression for the return rate reveals that DQPTs in this case are always completely eliminated.</description>

      <title>Typical reconstruction limit and phase transition of maximum entropy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dependence of the maximum entropy method (MEM) reconstruction performance on the default model. The maximum entropy method is a reconstruction technique that utilizes prior information, referred to as the default model, to recover original signals from observed data, and it is widely used in underdetermined systems. The broad applications have been reported in fields ranging from the analysis of observational data in seismology and astronomy, to large-scale computations in quantum chemistry, and even in social sciences such as linguistics. However, a known drawback of MEM is that its results depend on the assumed default model. In this study, we employ the replica method to elucidate how discrepancies in the default model affect the reconstruction of signals with specific distributions. We report that in certain cases, even small discrepancies can induce phase transitions, leading to reconstruction failure. Additionally, by comparing MEM with reconstruction based on L1-norm optimization, a method proposed in recent years, we demonstrate that MEM exhibits lower reconstruction accuracy under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by a nonlinear friction and a velocity-dependent noise. There appear several distinct regimes: a standard regime where the probe exhibits passive Brownian motion, and peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. The resulting propulsion speeds and their persistence are quantitatively obtained and are confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. In 1D, a soft coupling is necessary, whereas in 2D, more realistic interactions, such as Lennard-Jones, suffice. Our findings thus reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</description>

      <title>Martingale approach for first-passage problems of time-additive observables in Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method based on martingales to study first-passage problems of time-additive observables exiting an interval of finite width in a Markov process. In the limit that the interval width is large, we derive generic expressions for the splitting probability and the cumulants of the first-passage time. These expressions relate first-passage quantities to the large deviation properties of the time-additive observable. We find that there are three qualitatively different regimes depending on the properties of the large deviation rate function of the time-additive observable. These regimes correspond to exponential, super-exponential, or sub-exponential suppression of events at the unlikely boundary of the interval. Furthermore, we show that the statistics of first-passage times at both interval boundaries are in general different, even for symmetric thresholds and in the limit of large interval widths. While the statistics of the times to reach the likely boundary are determined by the cumulants of the time-additive observables in the original process, those at the unlikely boundary are determined by a dual process. We obtain these results from a one-parameter family of positive martingales that we call Perron martingales, as these are related to the Perron root of a tilted version of the transition rate matrix defining the Markov process. Furthermore, we show that each eigenpair of the tilted matrix has a one-parameter family of martingales. To solve first-passage problems at finite thresholds, we generally require all one-parameter families of martingales, including the non-positive ones. We illustrate this by solving the first-passage problem for run-and-tumble particles exiting an interval of finite width.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Energy Spreading in Hard-Particle Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional array of particles interacting via an infinite well potential. We explore the properties of energy spreading from an initial state where only a group of particles has non-zero velocities while others are resting. We characterize anomalous diffusion of the active domain via moments and entropies of the energy distribution. Only in the special cases of a single-well potential (hard-particle gas) and of the distance between the particles being half of the potential width does the diffusion have a single scale; otherwise, a multiscale anomalous diffusion is observed.</description>

      <title>Splash in an inhomogeneous gas in one dimension: Exact analysis and molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the splash phenomenon resulting from the energy input at the interface between a vacuum and an inhomogeneous gas with density profile $\rho(r) = \rho_0 r^{-\beta}$. The energy input causes the formation of ballistic spatters that propagate into the vacuum, leading to a decay of the total energy in the inhomogeneous medium following a power law, $E(t) \sim t^{-\delta_s}$. We determine exactly the exponents $\delta_s$ by solving the Euler equation using a self-similar solution of second kind for different values of $\beta$. These exponents are further validated through event-driven molecular dynamics simulations. The determination of these exponents also allows us to numerically determine the spatio-temporal dependence of the density, velocity and temperature.</description>

      <title>Towards data analysis with diagrammatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. These diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be useful also for future applications, notably for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate in the context of dissipative state preparation how a system may asymptotically approach the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. Building on case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Treating the strength $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional turbulent condensates without bottom drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extent to which statistical equilibrium theory is applicable to driven dissipative dynamics remains an important open question in many systems. We use extensive direct numerical simulations of the incompressible two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equation to examine the steady state of large-scale condensates in 2D turbulence at finite Reynolds number $Re$ in the absence of bottom drag. Large-scale condensates appear above a critical Reynolds number $Re_c\approx 4.19$. Close to this onset, we find a power-law scaling of the energy with $Re-Re_c$, with the energy spectrum at large scales following the absolute equilibrium form proposed by Kraichnan. At larger $Re$, the energy spectrum deviates from this form, displaying a steep power-law range at low wave numbers with exponent $-5$, with most of the energy dissipation occurring within the condensate at large scales. We show that this spectral exponent is consistent with the logarithmic radial vorticity profile of the condensate vortices predicted by quasi-linear theory for a viscously saturated condensate. Our findings shed new light on the classical problem of large-scale turbulent condensation in forced dissipative 2D flows in finite domains, showing that the large scales are close to equilibrium dynamics in weakly turbulent flows but not in the strong condensate regime with $Re\gg1$.</description>

      <title>Modelling Interfacial Dynamics Using Hydrodynamic Density Functional Theory: Dynamic Contact Angles and the Role of Local Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) is applied to analyse dynamic contact angles of droplets in order to assess its predictive capability regarding wetting phenomena at the microscopic scale and to evaluate its feasibility for multiscale modelling. Hydrodynamic DFT incorporates the influence of fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces into a hydrodynamic theory by including a thermodynamic model based on classical DFT for the chemical potential of inhomogeneous fluids. It simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations far away from interfaces, thus connecting microscopic molecular modelling and continuum fluid dynamics. In this work we use a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) and the viscosity is obtained from generalised entropy scaling, a one-parameter model which takes microscopic information of the fluid and solid phase into account. Deterministic (noise-free) density and velocity profiles reveal wetting phenomena including different advancing and receding contact angles, the transition from equilibrium to steady state and the rolling motion of droplets. Compared to a viscosity model based on bulk values, generalised entropy scaling provides more accurate results, which stresses the importance of including microscopic information in the local viscosity model. Hydrodynamic DFT is transferable as it captures the influence of different external forces, wetting strengths and (molecular) solid roughness. For all results good quantitative agreement with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations is found, which emphasises that hydrodynamic DFT is able to predict wetting phenomena at the microscopic scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system reveals different operational phases for the range of parameter regimes considered, such as a quantum heat engine. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Behavior of the scaling correlation functions under severe subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale-invariance is a ubiquitous observation in the dynamics of large distributed complex systems. The computation of its scaling exponents, which provide clues on its origin, is often hampered by the limited available sampling data, making an appropriate mathematical description a challenge. This work investigates the behavior of correlation functions in fractal systems under conditions of severe subsampling. Analytical and numerical results reveal a striking robustness: the correlation functions continue to capture the expected scaling exponents despite substantial data reduction. This behavior is demonstrated numerically for the random 2-D Cantor set and the Sierpinski gasket, both consistent with exact analytical predictions. Similar robustness is observed in 1-D time series both synthetic and experimental, as well as in high-resolution images of a neuronal structure. Overall, these findings are broadly relevant for the structural characterization of biological systems under realistic sampling constraints.</description>

      <title>Accurate stochastic simulation of nonlinear reactions between closest particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of diffusing point particles in which any triplet of particles reacts and is removed from the system when the relative proximity of the constituent particles satisfies a predefined condition. Proximity-based reaction conditions of this kind are commonly used in particle-based simulations of chemical kinetics to mimic bimolecular reactions, those involving just two reactants, and have been extensively studied. The rate at which particles react within the system is determined by the reaction condition and particulate diffusion. In the bimolecular case, analytic relations exist between the reaction rate and the distance at which particles react allowing modellers to tune the rate of the reaction within their simulations by simply altering the reaction condition. However, generalising proximity-based reaction conditions to trimolecular reactions, those involving three particles, is more complicated because it requires understanding the distribution of the closest diffusing particle to a point in the vicinity of a spatially dependent absorbing boundary condition. We find that in this case the evolution of the system is described by a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation with no known analytic solution, which makes it difficult to relate the reaction rate to the reaction condition. To resolve this, we use singular perturbation theory to obtain a leading-order solution and show how to derive an approximate expression for the reaction rate. We then use finite element methods to quantify the higher-order corrections to this solution and the reaction rate, which are difficult to obtain analytically. Leveraging the insights gathered from this analysis, we demonstrate how to correct for the errors that arise from adopting the approximate expression for the reaction rate, enabling for the construction of more accurate particle-based simulations than previously possible.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for universal operator growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum observables of generic many-body systems exhibit a universal pattern of growth in the Krylov space of operators. This pattern becomes particularly manifest in the Lanczos basis, where the evolution superoperator assumes the tridiagonal form. According to the universal operator growth hypothesis, the nonzero elements of the superoperator, known as Lanczos coefficients, grow asymptotically linearly. We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns. For one of the families, the Krylov complexity is computed exactly.</description>

      <title>Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.</description>

      <title>Quantum conditional mutual information as a probe of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Supersolid phase in two-dimensional soft-core bosons at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supersolid phase of soft-core bosons in two dimensions is investigated using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock and quantum Monte Carlo methods. An approximate phase diagram at finite temperatures is initially constructed using the mean-field approach, which is subsequently validated through precise path-integral simulations, enabling a microscopic characterization of the various phases. Superfluid and melting/freezing transitions are analyzed through the superfluid density and the long-range behavior of correlation functions associated with positional and orientational order, in accordance with the general picture of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. A broad region at low temperatures is identified where the supersolid phase exists, separating the uniform superfluid phase from the normal quasi-crystal phase. Additionally, a potential intermediate hexatic phase with quasi long-range orientational order is identified in a narrow region between the normal solid and fluid phases. These findings establish self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory beyond the local density approximation as an effective tool, complementary to computationally intensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, for investigating the melting of the supersolid phase and the possible emergence of the hexatic superfluid phase in bosonic systems with various interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Independent e- and m-anyon confinement in the parallel field toric code on non-square lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kitaev's toric code has become one of the most studied models in physics and is highly relevant to the fields of both quantum error correction and condensed matter physics. Most notably, it is the simplest known model hosting an extended, deconfined topological bulk phase. To this day, it remains challenging to reliably and robustly probe topological phases, as many state-of-the-art order parameters are sensitive to specific models and even specific parameter regimes. With the emergence of powerful quantum simulators which are approaching the regimes of topological bulk phases, there is a timely need for experimentally accessible order parameters. Here we study the ground state physics of the parallel field toric code on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. By extending the concept of experimentally accessible percolation-inspired order parameters (POPs) we show that electric and magnetic anyons are independently confined on the honeycomb and triangular lattices, unlike on the square lattice. Our work manifestly demonstrates that, even in the ground state, we must make a distinction between topological order and \mbox{(de-)confinement}. Moreover, we report multi-critical points in the aforementioned confinement phase diagrams. Finally, we map out the topological phase diagrams on the honeycomb, triangular and cubic lattices and compare the performance of the POPs with other topological order parameters. Our work paves the way for studies of confinement involving dynamical matter and the associated multi-critical points in contemporary quantum simulation platforms for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature Effects in False Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastability is a phenomenon encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale from a metastable to a stable state is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.</description>

Abstract: The continuous injection of energy in a stationary gas creates a shock wave that propagates radially outwards. We study the hydrodynamics of this disturbance using event driven molecular dynamics of a hard sphere gas in two and three dimensions, the numerical solution of the Euler equation with a virial equation of state for the gas, and the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation, for the cases when the driving is localised in space and when it is uniform throughout the shock. We show that the results from the Euler equation do not agree with the data from hard sphere simulations when the driving is uniform and has singularities when the driving is localised. Including dissipative terms through the Navier-Stokes equation results in reasonably good description of the data, when the coefficients of dissipation are chose parametrically.</description>

      <title>Characteristic oscillations in frequency-resolved heat dissipation of linear time-delayed Langevin systems: Approach from the violation of the fluctuation-response relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delayed effects are widely present in nature, often accompanied by distinctive nonequilibrium features, such as negative apparent heat dissipation. To elucidate detailed structures of the dissipation, we study the frequency decomposition of the heat dissipation in linear time-delayed Langevin systems. We decompose the heat dissipation into frequency spectrum using the Harada-Sasa equality, which relates the heat dissipation to the violation of the fluctuation-response relation (FRR). We find a characteristic oscillatory behavior in the spectrum, and the oscillation asymptotically decays with an envelope inversely proportional to the frequency in the high-frequency region. Furthermore, the oscillation over the low-frequency region reflects the magnitude and sign of the heat dissipation. We confirm the generality of the results by extending our analysis to systems with multiple delay times. Since the violation of FRR is experimentally accessible, our results suggest an experimental direction for detecting and analyzing detailed characteristics of dissipation in time-delayed systems.</description>

Abstract: A new thermal bath scheme for Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg) is introduced. New game moves in sampling the given temperature is achieved via Monte Carlo dynamics of both Metropolis and Glauber as a stochastic game. This kind of approach makes the game an ideal tool for demonstrating thermal dependency of entropy production in a novel way. Using this new approach, Ising-Conway Entropy game's rate of entropy production depending on different temperatures are explored. Thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and plausible test bed for studying complex dynamical systems in classical statistical mechanics, that is conceptually simple, pedagogically accessible, yet realistic.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05266v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) provides the most comprehensive characterization of bipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Ground states of local Hamiltonians inherit this locality, resulting in EHs that are dominated by local, few-body terms. Unfortunately, in non-equilibrium situations, analytic results are rare and largely confined to continuous field theories, which fail to accurately describe microscopic models. To address this gap, we present an analytic result for the EH following a quantum quench in non-interacting fermionic models, valid in the ballistic scaling regime. The derivation adapts the celebrated quasiparticle picture to operators, providing detailed insights into its physical properties. The resulting analytic formula serves as a foundation for engineering EHs in quantum optics experiments.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dimensions from conformal field theory: Generalized $\phi^{2n+1}$ theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate $\phi^{2n+1}$ deformations of the generalized free theory in the $\epsilon$ expansion, where the canonical kinetic term is generalized to a higher-derivative version. For $n=1$, we use the conformal multiplet recombination method to determine the leading anomalous dimensions of the fundamental scalar operator $\phi$ and the bilinear composite operators $\mathcal J$. Then we extend the $n=1$ analysis to the Potts model with $S_{N+1}$ symmetry and its higher-derivative generalization, in which $\phi$ is promoted to an $N$-component field. We further examine the Chew-Frautschi plots and their $N$ dependence. However, for each integer $n&gt;1$, the leading anomalous dimensions of $\phi$ and $ \mathcal{J}$ are not fully determined and contain one unconstrained constant, which in the canonical cases can be fixed by the results from the traditional diagrammatic method. In all cases, we verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with crossing symmetry using the analytic bootstrap methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</description>
