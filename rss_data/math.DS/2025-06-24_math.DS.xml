      <description>arXiv:2506.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that uniformly exponentially stable random dynamical systems on the half line have equivalent dynamics through a $C^m-$ conjugacy. This result was obtained for random differential equations as well as for random dynamical systems with a uniformly exponentially stable linear part.</description>

      <title>McGehee blowup for Lagrangian systems and instability of equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that total instability is a generic phenomenon in the real analytic class of electromagnetic Lagrangian systems under a weak magnetism hypothesis. The main object in the proof is an adaptation of the McGehee blowup for these systems. Together with this result, new criteria for total instability are introduced for both generic and non-generic cases.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction of Homogeneous Polynomial Dynamical Systems via Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model reduction plays a critical role in system control, with established methods such as balanced truncation widely used for linear systems. However, extending these methods to nonlinear settings, particularly polynomial dynamical systems that are often used to model higher-order interactions in physics, biology, and ecology, remains a significant challenge. In this article, we develop a novel model reduction method for homogeneous polynomial dynamical systems (HPDSs) with linear input and output grounded in tensor decomposition. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of HPDSs, we construct reduced models by extracting dominant mode subspaces via higher-order singular value decomposition. Notably, we establish that key system-theoretic properties, including stability, controllability, and observability, are preserved in the reduced model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the rotation number for perturbations of rational rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter dependence of the rotation number in families of circle maps which are perturbations of rational rotations is described. We show that if, at a critical parameter value, the map is a (rigid) rotation $x\to x+\frac{p}{q}~({\rm mod}~1)$ with $p$ and $q$ coprime, then the rotation number is differentiable at that point provided a transversality condition holds, and hence that the rotation number scales linearly at this parameter. We provide an explicit and computable expression for the derivative in terms of the Fourier series of the map, and illustrate the results with the Arnold circle map and some modifications. Piecewise linear circle maps can also be treated using the same techniques.</description>

      <title>Cocycle superrigidity for median spaces of finite rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cocycle superrigidity in the setting of finite rank median spaces. By exploiting a dynamical approach to superrigidity, we establish, for a median space X of finite rank, the superrigidity of Isom(X)-valued cocycles for a product of locally compact second countable groups. In the case of action by irreducible lattices in such product groups, this approach yields a new and self-contained proof of the superrigidity of homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic estimates for solutions of inhomogeneous non-divergence diffusion equations with drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of the nonlinear processes modeled by diffusion-transport partial differential equations in non-divergence form with drifts. The solutions are subject to some inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Starting with the reduced linear problem, we obtain the asymptotic estimates for the solutions, as time $t\to\infty$, depending on the asymptotic behavior of the forcing term and boundary data. These are established in both cases when the drifts are uniformly bounded, and unbounded as $t\to\infty$. For the nonlinear problem, we prove the convergence of the solutions under suitable conditions that balance the growth of the nonlinear term with the decay of the data. To take advantage of the diffusion in the non-divergence form, we prove an inhomogeneous version of the Landis-typed Growth Lemma and apply it to successive time-intervals. At each time step, the center for the barrier function is selected carefully to optimize the contracting factor. Our rigorous results show the robustness of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give aperiodic tile sets based on Sturmian words of quadratic slopes. The method works for any quadratic irrational slope and we can produce infinitely many aperiodic tile sets whose underlying scaling constant is a unit of any real quadratic field. There are two key ingredients in our construction. The first one is ``Sturmian lattices'', an interesting grid structure generated by Sturmian words that emerged in an aperiodic monotile called Smith Turtle.The second is the bounded displacement equivalence of Delone sets, which plays a central role in this construction.</description>

Abstract: Hutchcroft and Pete showed that countably infinite groups with Property (T) admit cost one actions, resolving a question of Gaboriau. We give a streamlined proof of their theorem, and extend it both to locally compact second countable groups and unimodular random graphs. We prove unimodular random graph analogues of the Connes--Weiss and Glasner--Weiss theorem characterising Property (T).</description>

      <title>Infinite polynomial patterns in large subsets of the rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a question of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson, we prove two new results about infinite polynomial configurations in large subsets of the rational numbers. First, given a finite coloring of $\mathbb{Q}$, we show that there exists an infinite set $B = \{b_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\{b_i, b_i^2 + b_j : i &lt; j\}$ is monochromatic. Second, we prove that every subset of positive density in the rational numbers contains a translate of such an infinite configuration.
  The proofs build upon methods developed in a series of papers by Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson to translate from combinatorics into dynamics, where the core of the argument reduces to understanding the behavior of certain polynomial ergodic averages. The new dynamical tools required for this analysis are a Wiener--Wintner theorem for polynomially-twisted ergodic averages in $\mathbb{Q}$-systems and a structure theorem for Abramov $\mathbb{Q}$-systems.
  The end of the paper includes a discussion of related problems in the integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on flat tori satisfying a simple and explicit Diophantine non-degeneracy condition. Provided that the nonlinearity contains a cubic term, we prove the almost global existence and stability of most of the small solutions in high regularity Sobolev spaces. To this end, we develop a normal form approach designed to handle general resonant Hamiltonian partial differential equations for which it is possible to modulate the frequencies by using the initial data.</description>

      <title>The integration problem for principal connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Integration Problem for principal connections. Just as a principal connection on a principal bundle $\phi:Q\rightarrow M$ may be used to split $TQ$ into horizontal and vertical subbundles, a discrete connection may be used to split $Q\times Q$ into horizontal and vertical submanifolds. All discrete connections induce a connection on the same principal bundle via a process known as the Lie or derivative functor. The Integration Problem consists of describing, for a principal connection $\mathcal{A}$, the set of all discrete connections whose associated connection is $\mathcal{A}$. Our first result is that for \emph{flat} principal connections, the Integration Problem has a unique solution among the \emph{flat} discrete connections. More broadly, under a fairly mild condition on the structure group $G$ of the principal bundle $\phi$, we prove that the existence part of the Integration Problem has a solution that needs not be unique. Last, we see that, when $G$ is abelian, given compatible continuous and discrete curvatures the Integration Problem has a unique solution constrained by those curvatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Cantwell-Conlon-Fenley on endperiodic homeomorphisms of infinite type surfaces, we define and study endperiodic and generalized endperiodic maps of an infinite graph with finitely many ends. Adapting the work of Bestvina-Handel to the infinite type setting, we define endperiodic relative train track maps. We prove that any generalized endperiodic map is homotopic to a generalized endperiodic relative train track map, via a combinatorially bounded homotopy equivalence. We show that the (largest) Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of a relative train track representation of a generalized endperiodic map $f$ is a canonical quantity associated to $f$ as it admits a canonical group theoretic interpretation. Moreover, the (largest) Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue and the topological entropy of a relative train track map is the smallest among its proper homotopy equivalence class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every irreducible outer automorphism of the free group of rank r is topologically represented by an irreducible train track map $f$ on some graph $\Gamma$ of rank r. Moreover, $f$ can always be written as a composition of folds and a graph isomorphism. We give a lower bound on the stretch factor of an irreducible outer automorphism in terms of the number of folds of $f$ and the number of edges in $\Gamma$. In the case that $f$ is periodic on the vertex set of $\Gamma$, we show a precise notion of the latent symmetry of $\Gamma$ gives a lower bound on the number of folds required. We use this notion of latent symmetry to classify all possible irreducible single fold train track maps.</description>

      <title>Cup and cap products for cohomology and homology groups of ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the cup and cap products within the cohomology and homology groups of ample groupoids, focusing on their applications and fundamental properties. Ample groupoids, which are \'etale groupoids with a totally disconnected unit space, play a crucial role in the study of topological dynamical systems and operator algebras. We introduce the cup product, which defines a bilinear map on cohomology classes, providing a graded ring structure, and the cap product, which defines a bilinear map relating homology and cohomology. The paper aims to make these concepts accessible to a broader mathematical audience, offering clear definitions and detailed explanations. We also demonstrate an application of the cap product in the analysis of automorphisms of groupoid $C^*$-algebras. Specifically, we show how it helps determine the asymptotic innerness of automorphisms. Our results include the first explicit computations of cup products in the cohomology of tiling spaces, which may pave the way for new research in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $r \geq 3$, we prove that there exists $\lambda &gt;0$ depending only on $r$ so that if $G$ is a metric graph of rank $r$ with metric entropy $1$, then there exists a proper subgraph $H$ of $G$ with metric entropy at least $\lambda$. This answers a question of the second two authors together with Rieck.
