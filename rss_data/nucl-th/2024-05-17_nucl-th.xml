      <title>BSQ Conserved Charges in Relativistic Viscous Hydrodynamics solved with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation laws play a crucial role in the modeling of heavy-ion collisions, including the those for charges such as baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q). In this study, we present a new 2+1 relativistic viscous hydrodynamic code called CCAKE which uses the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formalism to locally conserve BSQ charges, together with an extended description of the multi-dimensional equation of state (EoS) obtained from lattice Quantum Chromodynamics. Initial conditions for CCAKE are supplied by the ICCING model, which samples gluon splittings into quark anti-quark pairs to generate the initial BSQ charge distributions. We study correlations between the BSQ charges and find that local BSQ fluctuations remain finite during the evolution, with corresponding chemical potentials of ($\sim100$--$200 \,\rm MeV$) at freeze-out. We find that our framework produces reasonable multiplicities of identified particles and that ICCING has no significant effect on the collective flow of all charged particles nor of identified particles when only one particle of interest is considered. However, we show specifically for Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV that ICCING does have an effect on collective flow of identified particles if two particles of interest are considered.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions induced by thermal vorticity and thermal shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vorticity is a quantity defined in a relativistic fluid that describes how much a fluid element is rotating and accelerating. By measuring the spin polarization of hadrons, it was found that the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions is the most "vorticous" fluid ever observed. More generally, this opens the possibility to study the physics of QCD matter using spin. Here I use statistical quantum field theory applied to a fluid in local thermodynamic equilibrium to show how to connect the average spin of a fermion with hydrodynamic quantities, and in particular with the thermal vorticity and the thermal shear. I show that the spin polarization of a Dirac particle induced by thermal vorticity is related to the gravitational (in medium) form factor related to spin-rotation coupling. For these reasons, as we are understanding the role of spin in hydrodynamics and in heavy-ion collisions, spin is becoming a promising tool to investigate the properties of QCD and whose applications are just begun to be explored.</description>

      <title>Direct ab initio calculation of the $^{4}$He nuclear electric dipole polarizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of nuclear electromagnetic sum rules by directly diagonalizing the nuclear Hamiltonian in a large basis is numerically challenging and has not been performed for $A&gt;2$ nuclei. With the significant progress of high performance computing, we show that calculating sum rules using numerous discretized continuum states obtained by directly diagonalizing the ab initio no-core shell model Hamiltonian is achievable numerically. Specifically, we calculate the $^{4}$He electric dipole ($E1$) polarizability, that is an inverse energy weighted sum rule, employing the Daejeon16 $NN$ interaction. We demonstrate that the calculations are numerically tractable as the dimension of the basis increases and are convergent. Our results for the $^{4}$He electric dipole polarizability are consistent with the most recent experimental data and are compared with those of other theoretical studies employing different techniques and various interactions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review article presents historical developments and recent advances in our understanding on the three-body forces and Efimov physics, from an interdisciplinary viewpoint encompassing nuclear physics and cold atoms. Theoretical attempts to elucidate the three-body force with the chiral effective field theory are explained, followed by an overview of experiments aimed at observing signatures of the nuclear three-body force. Some recent experimental and theoretical works in the field of cold atoms devoted to measuring and engineering three-body forces among atoms are also presented. As a phenomenon arising from the three-body effect, Efimov physics in both cold atoms and nuclear systems is reviewed.</description>

      <title>Flow and Equation of State of nuclear matter at $\mathbf{E_{\mathrm{kin}}}$/A=0.25-1.5 GeV with the SMASH transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparison of directed and elliptic flow data by the FOPI collaboration in Au-Au, Xe-CsI, and Ni-Ni collisions at beam kinetic energies from 0.25 to 1.5 GeV per nucleon to simulations using the SMASH hadronic transport model. The Equation of State is parameterized as a function of nuclear density and momentum dependent potentials are newly introduced in SMASH. With a statistical analysis, we show that the collective flow data at lower energies is in best agreement with a soft momentum dependent potential, while the elliptic flow at higher energies requires a harder momentum dependent Equation of State.</description>

      <title>A study of the fine-structure constant dependence of radiative capture in Halo-EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fine-structure constant dependence of the rates of some selected radiative capture reactions within the framework of so-called Halo Effective Field Theory in order to assess the adequacy of some assumptions made on the Coulomb penetrability. We find that this dependence deviates from that implied by a parameterization of the cross sections of this effect via a simple penetration factor. Some features of this fine-structure dependence are discussed, in particular its potential impact on the abundances of the light elements in primordial nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Formation of superconducting pair correlations in spherical even-even nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of like nucleon pair correlations in the ground state of spherical even-even nuclei is considered within a special Bogoliubov transformation. It is confirmed that in closed subshell nuclei superconducting pair correlations start to form if the coupling constant $G$ exceeds a certain threshold value. Rough upper and lower estimates are obtained for the threshold value. It is shown, that superconducting correlations exist in open subshell nuclei at any positive $G$. In this case, nucleon pairs are distributed over all subshells participating in the pairing interaction.</description>

      <title>The Magic in Nuclear and Hypernuclear Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toward an improved understanding of the role of quantum information in nuclei and exotic matter, we examine the magic (non-stabilizerness) in low-energy strong interaction processes. As stabilizer states can be prepared efficiently using classical computers, and include classes of entangled states, it is magic and fluctuations in magic, along with entanglement, that determine resource requirements for quantum simulations. As a measure of fluctuations in magic induced by scattering, the "magic power" of the S-matrix is introduced. Using experimentally-determined scattering phase shifts and mixing parameters, the magic power in nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon scattering, along with the magic in the deuteron, are found to exhibit interesting features. The $\Sigma^-$-baryon is identified as a potential candidate catalyst for enhanced spreading of magic and entanglement in dense matter, depending on in-medium decoherence.</description>

      <title>Locating the critical point for the hadron to quark-gluon plasma phase transition from finite-size scaling of proton cumulants in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a finite-size scaling analysis of net-proton number cumulants in Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energies between $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4$ GeV and 54.4 GeV to search for evidence of a critical point in the QCD phase diagram. In our analysis, we use both susceptibility and Binder cumulants which we extract from the second and fourth moments of the net-proton number distributions. We take measurements in different rapidity bin widths, corresponding to different subvolumes of the system, as probes of different length scales. We use model simulations to verify the applicability of this approach, then apply it to data and find evidence for a critical point near the baryon chemical potential of $\mu_{B} \approx 625$ MeV and temperature of $T \approx 140$ MeV. The Binder cumulants, also analyzed in varying rapidity bin widths, provide complementary evidence for a critical point in a similar region. This is the first analysis of experimental data to locate the critical point in a range consistent with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Probing neutrino-nucleus interaction in DUNE and MicroBooNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino experiments utilize heavy nuclear targets to achieve high statistics neutrino-nucleus interaction event rate, which leads to systematic uncertainties in the oscillation parameters due to the nuclear effects and uncertainties in the cross-section. Understanding the interaction of neutrinos with the nucleus becomes crucial in determining the oscillation parameters with high precision. We investigate the uncertainty in quasi-elastic interaction due to nuclear effects by selecting exactly 1 proton, 0 pions, and any number of neutrons in the final state using DUNE and MicroBooNE detectors, and the effects on oscillation parameters in the DUNE detector. The kinematic method along with this selection can be used for accurate neutrino energy reconstruction in the quasi-elastic channel where the nuclear effects are inevitable.</description>

      <title>The 3He(\vec n,p)3H parity-conserving asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the n$^3$He collaboration reported a measurement of the parity-violating (PV) proton directional asymmetry $A_{\mathrm {PV}} = (1.55\pm 0.97~\mathrm {(st\ at)} \pm 0.24~\mathrm {(sys)})\times 10^{-8}$ in the capture reaction of ${}^3$He$(\vec {n},{\mathrm p}){}^3$H at meV incident neutron energies. The result increased the limited inventory of precisely measured and calculable PV observables in few-body systems required to further understand the structure of hadronic weak interaction. In this letter, we report the experimental and theoretical investigation of a parity conserving (PC) asymmetry $A_{\mathrm {PC}}$ in the same reaction (the first ever measured PC observable at meV neutron energies). As a result of S- and P-wave mixing in the reaction, the $A_{\mathrm {PC}}$ is inversely proportional to the neutron wavelength $\lambda$. The experimental value is $(\lambda\times A_{\mathrm {PC}})\equiv\beta= (-1.97 \pm 0.28~\mathrm{(stat)}\pm 0.12~\mathrm{(sys)}) \times 10^{-6}$ Amstrongs. We present results for a theoretical analysis of this reaction by solving the four-body scattering problem within the hyperspherical harmonic method. We find that in the ${}^3$He$(\vec {n},{\mathrm p}){}^3$H reaction, $A_{\mathrm {PC}}$ depends critically on the energy and width of the close $0^-$ resonant state of ${}^4$He, resulting in a large sensitivity to the spin-orbit components of the nucleon-nucleon force and even to the three-nucleon force. The analysis of the accurately measured $A_{\mathrm {PC}}$ and $A_{\mathrm {PV}}$ using the same few-body theoretical models gives essential information needed to interpret the PV asymmetry in the ${}^3$He$(\vec {n}, {\mathrm p}){}^3$H reaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cost and the error of the adiabatic theorem for preparing the final eigenstate are discussed in terms of path length. Previous studies in terms of the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivatives with the spectral gap are limited to describe the cost of adiabatic state preparation for large systems. We argue that total time is not a good measure for determining the computational difficulty of adiabatic quantum computation by developing a no-go theorem. From the result of time-periodic Hamiltonian cases, we suggest that there are proxies for computational cost which typically grow as path length increases when the error is kept fixed and small and consider possible conjectures on how general the behavior is.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resonances, i.e., metastable states with a finite lifetime, play an important role in nuclear physics and other domains. Describing this phenomenon theoretically is generally a challenging task. In this work, we combine two established techniques to address this challenge. Complex scaling makes it possible to calculate resonances with bound-state-like methods. Finite-volume simulations exploit the fact that the infinite-volume properties of quantum systems are encoded in how discrete energy levels change as one varies the size of the volume. We apply complex scaling to systems in finite periodic boxes and derive the volume dependence of states in this scenario, demonstrating with explicit examples how one can use these relations to infer infinite-volume resonance energies and lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Implications of comprehensive nuclear and astrophysics data on the equations of state of neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06018v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations of state (EoSs) governing neutron star (NS) matter obtained for both non-relativistic and relativistic mean-field models are systematically confronted with a diverse set of terrestrial data and astrophysical observations within the Bayesian framework. The terrestrial data, spans from bulk properties of finite nuclei to the heavy-ion collisions, constrain the symmetric nuclear matter EoS and the symmetry energy up to twice the saturation density ($\rho_0$= 0.16 fm$^{-3}$). The astrophysical observations encompass the NS radius, the tidal deformability, and the lower bound on maximum mass. Three distinct posterior distributions of EoSs are generated by gradually updating the priors with different constraints: (i) only the maximum NS mass, (ii) incorporating additional terrestrial data, (iii) combining both the terrestrial data and astrophysical observations. These EoS distributions are then compared using the Kullback-Liebler divergence which highlights the significant constraints imposed on the EoSs by the currently available lower bound of NS maximum mass and terrestrial data. The remaining astrophysical observations marginally refine the EoS within the density range $\sim$ 2-3$\rho_0$. It is observed that the relativistic mean field model yields stiffer EoS around the saturation density, but predict smaller values of the speed of sound and proton fraction in the interior of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chromodynamics Resolution of the ATOMKI Anomaly in ${\rm {^4He}}$ Nuclear Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of anomalous angular correlations in electron-positron pairs produced from excited states of $^{4}$He, $^{8}$Be and $^{12}$C nuclei have been suggested as due to the creation and subsequent decay of a new light particle of mass $\sim$17 MeV. In this work, we investigate the possibility that the source of the observed signals is a set of new excitation channels created by the 12-quark hidden-color Fock state within the ${\rm {^4He}}$ nuclear wavefunction dubbed the "hexadiquark." We calculate the invariant $e^+e^-$ mass spectrum for the electromagnetic transition from a new excitation of $^{4}$He, estimating its differential and total decay width. We find that we can fit the shape of the anomalous signal with the QCD Fock state at excitation energy $\rm E^{*} = 17.9 \pm 1$ MeV and a Gaussian form factor for the electromagnetic decay. We address the physical issues with the fit parameters using properties of the hexadiquark state, in particular the three weakly repulsive $\rm 6_C$ interactions of $\rm SU(3)_C$ between diquark pairs. Experimental tests of our model are described in detail. In light of this work, we emphasize the need for independent experimental confirmation or refutation of the ATOMKI results as well as dedicated experiments to search for the proposed new excitations of ${\rm ^4He}$ and other $\alpha$-cluster nuclei.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous reweighting of Transverse Momentum Dependent distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bayesian reweighting procedure is extended to the case of multiple independent extractions of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs). By exploiting the data on transverse single spin asymmetries, $A_N$, for inclusive pion production in polarized proton-proton collisions measured at RHIC, we perform a simultaneous reweighting of the quark Sivers, transversity and Collins TMD functions extracted from semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into hadron pairs. The impact of the implementation of the Soffer bound, as well as the differences between older and newer $A_N$ data, are investigated. The agreement with $A_N$ data at large-$x_F$ values, a kinematical region complementary to those explored in SIDIS measurements, is enhanced, improving the knowledge of the polarized quark TMDs in the large-$x$ region.</description>

Abstract: In these lectures, we present the behavior of conventional $\bar{q}q$ mesons, glueballs, and hybrids in the large-$N_{c}$ limit of QCD. To this end, we use an approach based on rather simple NJL-like bound-state equations. The obtained large-$N_{c}$ scaling laws are general and coincide with the known results. A series of consequences, such as the narrowness of certain mesons and the smallness of some interaction types, the behavior of chiral and dilaton models at large-$N_{c},$ and the relation to the compositeness condition and the standard derivation of large-$N_{c}$ results, are explained. The bound-state formalism shows also that mesonic molecular and dynamically generated states do not form in the large-$N_{c}$ limit. The same fate seems to apply also for tetraquark states, but here further studies are needed. Next, following the same approach, baryons are studied as bound states of a generalized diquark ($N_{c}-1$ antisymmetric object) and a quark. Similarities and differences with regular mesons are discussed. All the standard scaling laws for baryons and their interaction with mesons are correctly reproduced. The behavior of chiral models involving baryons and describing chirally invariant mass generation is investigated. Finally, properties of QCD in the medium at large-$N_{c}$ are studied: the deconfinement phase transition is investigated along the temperature and the chemical potential directions, respectively. Within the QCD phase diagrams, the features of different models at large-$N_{c}$ are reviewed and the location of the critical endpoint is discussed. In the end, the very existence of nuclei and the implications of large-$N_{c}$ arguments for neutron stars are outlined.</description>

      <title>Many-body perturbation theory for strongly correlated effective Hamiltonians using effective field theory methods</title>

Abstract: Introducing low-energy effective Hamiltonians is usual to grasp most correlations in quantum many-body problems. For instance, such effective Hamiltonians can be treated at the mean-field level to reproduce some physical properties of interest. Employing effective Hamiltonians that contain many-body correlations renders the use of perturbative many-body techniques difficult because of the overcounting of correlations. In this work, we develop a strategy to apply an extension of the many-body perturbation theory starting from an effective interaction that contains correlations beyond the mean field level. The goal is to re-organize the many-body calculation to avoid the overcounting of correlations originating from the introduction of correlated effective Hamiltonians in the description. For this purpose, we generalize the formulation of the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory by including free parameters adjusted to reproduce the appropriate limits. In particular, the expansion in the bare weak-coupling regime and the strong-coupling limit serves as a valuable input to fix the value of the free parameters appearing in the resulting expression. This method avoids double counting of correlations using beyond-mean-field strategies for the description of many-body systems. The ground state energy of various systems relevant for ultracold atomic, nuclear, and condensed matter physics is reproduced qualitatively beyond the domain of validity of the standard many-body perturbation theory. Finally, our method suggests interpreting the formal results obtained as an effective field theory using the proposed reorganization of the many-body calculation. The results, like ground state energies, are improved systematically by considering higher orders in the extended many-body perturbation theory while maintaining a straightforward polynomial expansion.</description>

      <title>Reference Energies for Double Excitations: Improvement and Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19597</link>

Abstract: In the realm of photochemistry, the significance of double excitations (also known as doubly-excited states), where two electrons are concurrently elevated to higher energy levels, lies in their involvement in key electronic transitions essential in light-induced chemical reactions as well as their challenging nature from the computational theoretical chemistry point of view. Based on state-of-the-art electronic structure methods (such as high-order coupled-cluster, selected configuration interaction, and multiconfigurational methods), we improve and expand our prior set of accurate reference excitation energies for electronic states exhibiting a substantial amount of double excitations [http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01205; Loos et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 1939]. This extended collection encompasses 47 electronic transitions across 26 molecular systems that we separate into two distinct subsets: (i) 28 "genuine" doubly-excited states where the transitions almost exclusively involve doubly-excited configurations and (ii) 19 "partial" doubly-excited states which exhibit a more balanced character between singly- and doubly-excited configurations. For each subset, we assess the performance of high-order coupled-cluster (CC3, CCSDT, CC4, and CCSDTQ) and multiconfigurational methods (CASPT2, CASPT3, PC-NEVPT2, and SC-NEVPT2). Using as a probe the percentage of single excitations involved in a given transition ($\%T_1$) computed at the CC3 level, we also propose a simple correction that reduces the errors of CC3 by a factor of 3, for both sets of excitations. We hope that this more complete and diverse compilation of double excitations will help future developments of electronic excited-state methodologies.</description>
