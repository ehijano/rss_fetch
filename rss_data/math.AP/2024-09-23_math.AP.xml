      <title>Modulational Instability of Small Amplitude Periodic Traveling Waves in the Novikov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of smooth, small-amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Novikov equation, which is a Camassa-Holm type equation with cubic nonlinearities. Specifically, we investigate the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-spectrum of the associated linearized operator, which in this case is an integro-differential operator with periodic coefficients, in a neighborhood of the origin in the spectral plane. Our analysis shows that such small-amplitude periodic solutions are spectrally unstable to long-wavelength perturbations if the wave number if greater than a critical value, bearing out the famous Benmajin-Feir instability for the Novikov equation. On the other hand, such waves with wave number less than the critical value are shown to be spectrally stable. Our methods are based on applying spectral perturbation theory to the associated linearization.</description>

      <title>Critical $(p,q)$-fractional problems involving a sandwich type nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the following $(p,q)$-fractional problem $$ (-\Delta)^{s_{1}}_{p}u +(-\Delta)^{s_{2}}_{q}u=\lambda P(x)|u|^{k-2}u+\theta|u|^{p_{s_{1}}^{*}-2}u \, \mbox{ in }\, \Omega,\qquad u=0\, \mbox{ in }\, \mathbb{R}^{N} \setminus \Omega, $$ where $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is a general open set, $0&lt;s_{2}&lt;s_{1}&lt;1$, $1&lt;q&lt;k&lt;p&lt;N/s_{1}$, parameter $\lambda,\ \theta&gt;0$, $P$ is a nontrivial nonnegative weight, while $p_{s_{1}}^{*}=Np/(N-ps_{1})$ is the critical exponent. We prove that there exists a decreasing sequence $\{\theta_j\}_j$ such that for any $j\in\mathbb N$ and with $\theta\in(0,\theta_j)$, there exist $\lambda_*$, $\lambda^*&gt;0$ such that above problem admits at least $j$ distinct weak solutions with negative energy for any $\lambda\in (\lambda_*,\lambda^*)$. On the other hand, we show there exists $\overline{\lambda}&gt;0$ such that for any $\lambda&gt;\overline{\lambda}$, there exists $\theta^*=\theta^*(\lambda)&gt;0$ such that the above problem admits a nonnegative weak solution with negative energy for any $\theta\in(0,\theta^*)$.</description>

      <title>The effect of protest management strategies on protesting activity and social tension: a mathematical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protest activity, a constitutionally protected right in the United States under the First Amendment, serves as a key tool for individuals with limited individual influence to unite collectively and amplify their impact. Despite its legal recognition, the historical interaction between the government and protesters has been complex. In this study, we extend a model proposed in arXiv:1502.04725 [math.AP] to incorporate the influence of protest management strategies. Our research establishes the existence and stability of traveling wave solutions, supported by both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. We delve into the impact of two distinct protest management approaches on the qualitative and semi-quantitative characteristics of these traveling waves. These metrics can aid in categorizing different types of protests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discretely self-similar solutions to Oberbeck-Boussinesq system with Newtonian gravitational field for large discretely self-similar initial data are constructed in this note, extending the construction of Brandolese and Karch (arXiv:2311.01093) on self-similar solutions. It follows the approach of Bradshaw and Tsai (Ann.~Henri Poincar\'e 2017) and find an explicit a priori bound for the deviation from suitably revised profiles in similarity variables.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of BPS Vacuum and Multi-vortices in Inhomogeneous Abelian Higgs Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BPS limit of the inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model is considered in $(1+2)$-dimensions. The second order Bogomolny equation is examined in the presence of an inhomogeneity expressed as a function of spatial coordinates. Assuming a physically reasonable upper bound on the $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ norm of the inhomogeneity function, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of nontrivial BPS vacuum solution of zero energy and topological BPS multi-vortex solutions of quantized positive energies.</description>

      <title>The well-posedness and regularity of the Non-stationary Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations with the friction-type interface condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The friction-type interface condition (FIC) is introduced to describe the phenomenon of the slip and leak of fluid flow on the interface happens only when the difference of stress force is above a threshold. The FIC involves the subdifferential and can be regarded as an intermediate form of the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions. This work is devoted to the well-posedness of the non-stationary (Navier-)Stokes equations with FIC in 2D and 3D, the weak forms of which are parabolic variational inequalities of the second type. We establish the existence theorems using the regularization technique and the Galerkin method. For the Stokes case, we prove the global unique existence and investigate the $H^2$ regularity. In the case of 2D Navier-Stokes equation, we show the global unique existence of the weak and strong solutions, respectively. For the Navier-Stokes case in 3D, we demonstrate the global existence of the weak solution and the local unique existence of the strong solution.</description>

Abstract: We present a simple proof of some interpolation inequalities between H\"{o}lder and Lebesgue's spaces. As an example, to demonstrate the simplicity of their applications to nonlinear PDE, we give also a simple proof of an a-priory estimate in a smooth H\"{o}lder class for a solution to some quasilinear parabolic initial boundary value problem.</description>

      <title>Fine P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} rearrangement inequalities in metric spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fine P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} rearrangement inequalities into weighted intervals for Sobolev functions and functions of bounded variation defined on metric measure spaces supporting an isoperimetric inequality. We then specialize this theory to spaces with synthetic Ricci lower bounds in both finite and infinite dimension and characterize equality cases under minimal assumptions.
  As applications of our theory, we show new results around geometric and functional inequalities under Ricci lower bounds answering also questions raised in the literature. Finally, we study further settings and deduce a Faber-Krahn theorem on Euclidean spaces with radial log-convex densities, a boosted P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality with asymmetry reminder on weighted convex cones, the rigidity of Sobolev inequalities on Euclidean spaces outside a convex set and a general lower bound for Neumann eigenvalues on open sets in metric spaces.</description>

      <title>An advection-diffusion-reaction model for stress propagation between two interconnected zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a compartmental advection-diffusion network model to describe the propagation of stress in a population situated in two interconnected spatial zones during a disaster situation. The model accounts for interactions enabled by intrinsic transitions and imitations within each zone, as well as migrations between these zones. Using semigroup theory and abstract evolution equations, we prove the local existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the solutions. Additionally, we establish the positivity and $L^1$--boundedness of the solutions. Various numerical simulations are provided to illustrate different stress propagation scenarios, including the implementation of a local control strategy designed to minimize stress levels in a population facing a low-risk culture during a dangerous situation.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of the area of the vortex map: a non-parametric Plateau problem for a catenoid containing a segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of the non-parametric area $\mathcal A$ of the graph of the vortex map $u$ (a two-codimensional singular surface in $\mathbb R^4$) over the disc $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^2$ of radius $l$, we perform a careful analysis of the singular part of the relaxation of $\mathcal A$ computed at $u$. The precise description is given in terms of a area-minimizing surface in a vertical copy of $\mathbb R^3 \subset \mathbb R^4$, which is a sort of ``catenoid'' containing a segment corresponding to a radius of $\Omega$. The problem involves an area-minimization with a free boundary part; several boundary regularity properties of the minimizer are inspected.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy-Driven Flows With Navier-Slip Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this dissertation two-dimensional buoyancy-driven flows are investigated. While usually the Navier-Stokes equations are equipped with no-slip boundary conditions here we focus on the Navier-slip conditions that, depending on the system at hand, better reflect the physical behavior. In particular, we study two systems, Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and a closely related problem without thermal diffusion. In the former, bounds on the vertical heat transfer, given by the Nusselt number, with respect to the strength of the buoyancy force, characterized by the Rayleigh number, are derived. These bounds hold for a broad range of applications, allowing for non-flat boundaries, any sufficiently smooth positive slip coefficient, and are valid over all ranges of the Prandtl number, a system parameter determined by the fluid. For the thermally non-diffusive system, regularity estimates are proven. Up to a certain order, these bounds hold uniformly in time, which, combined with estimates for their growth, provide insight into the long-time behavior. In particular, solutions converge to the hydrostatic equilibrium, where the fluid's velocity vanishes and the buoyancy force is balanced by the pressure gradient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we assume that $q&gt;0$, $p&gt;1$ and $s\in(0,1)$ , and consider the following nonlinear fractional p-Laplacian equations on finite graphs: \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} \partial_t u^q(x,t)+(-\Delta)_p^su=0,\\[15pt] u(x,t)|_{t=0}=u_0&gt;0, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $(-\Delta)_p^s$ is fractional Laplace operator on finite graphs. We establish the existence of solutions to the above parabolic equation using an iterative approach, which is different from previous works on graphs. Furthermore, we also derive some energy estimate of the solution.</description>

      <title>High Order Vanishing Theorems for Nonsimple Blowup Solutions of Singular Liouville Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a singular Liouville equation, it is plausible that a non-simple blowup phenomenon occurs around a quantized singular pole. The presence of complex blowup profiles of bubbling solutions presents substantial challenges in applications. In this article, we demonstrate that under natural assumptions, non-simple blowup takes place only when the derivatives of certain coefficient functions approach zero. Our main result encompasses all previous findings and determines the vanishing order for any specific quantized singular source. Our theorems can be utilized not only to eliminate multiple non-simple blowup scenarios in applications but also to investigate blowup solutions with moving poles.</description>

Our assumptions on the initial data rule out lump solutions but give a precise description of the radiation field at large times. Our analysis uses the inverse scattering method and involves large-time asymptotics for solutions to a non-local Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Complex Band Structure for Subwavelength Evanescent Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the mathematical and numerical theory for evanescent waves in subwavelength band gap materials. We begin in the one-dimensional case, whereby fully explicit formulas for the complex band structure, in terms of the capacitance matrix, are available. As an example, we show that the gap functions can be used to accurately predict the decay rate of the interface mode of a photonic analogue of the SSH-model. In two dimensions, we derive the band gap Green's function and characterise the subwavelength gap functions via layer potential techniques. By generalising existing lattice-summation techniques, we illustrate our results numerically by computing the complex band structure in a variety of settings.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear phase mixing for the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system under an external Kepler potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Newtonian gravity, a self-gravitating collisionless gas around a massive object such as a star or a planet is modeled via the Vlasov--Poisson system with an external Kepler potential. The presence of this attractive potential allows for bounded trajectories along which the gas neither falls in towards the object nor escape to infinity.
  We study this system focusing on the regime with bounded trajectories. First, we prove quantitative linear phase mixing estimates in three dimensions outside symmetry. Second, our main result is a long-time nonlinear phase mixing theorem for spherically symmetric data with finite regularity. The mechanism is phenomenologically similar to Landau damping on a torus and our result applies to the same time scale (modulo logarithms) as the known results on Landau damping with finite regularity. However, in contrast with Landau damping, we need to contend with weaker linear estimates as well as use a system of dynamically defined action angle variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the variational problem with a mass constraint arising from the two-dimensional dispersion managed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with power-law type nonlinearity. We prove a threshold phenomenon with respect to mass for the existence of minimizers for all possible powers of nonlinearities, including at the threshold itself. This threshold is closely related to the best constant for the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Strichartz type inequality whose extremizers are found as a byproduct.</description>

      <title>Global Smooth Radially Symmetric Solutions to a Multidimensional Radiation Hydrodynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of a compressible inviscid radiative flow can be described by the radiative Euler equations, which consists of the Euler system coupled with a Poisson equation for the radiative heat flux through the energy equation. Although solutions of the compressible Euler system will generally develop singularity no matter how smooth and small the initial data are, it is believed that the radiation effect does imply some dissipative mechanism, which can guarantee the global regularity of the solutions of the radiative Euler equations at least for small initial data.
  Such an expectation was rigorously justified for the one-dimensional case, as for the multidimensional case, to the best of our knowledge, no result was available up to now. The main purpose of this paper is to show that the initial-boundary value problem of such a radiative Euler equation in a three-dimensional bounded concentric annular domain does admit a unique global smooth radially symmetric solution provided that the initial data is sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>On stable self-similar blowup for corotational wave maps and equivariant Yang-Mills connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider corotational wave maps from Minkowski spacetime into the sphere and the equivariant Yang-Mills equation for all energy-supercritical dimensions. Both models have explicit self-similar finite time blowup solutions, which continue to exist even past the singularity. We prove the nonlinear asymptotic stability of these solutions in spacetime regions that approach the future light cone of the singularity. For this, we develop a general functional analytic framework in adapted similarity coordinates that allows to evolve the stable wave flow near a self-similar blowup solution in such spacetime regions.</description>

      <title>Noisy integrate-and-fire equation: continuation after blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrate and fire equation is a classical model for neural assemblies which can exhibit finite time blow-up. A major open problem is to understand how to continue solutions after blow-up. Here we study an approach based on random discharge models and a change of time which generates a classical global solution to the expense of a strong absorption rate 1/$\epsilon$. We prove that in the limit $\epsilon$ $\rightarrow$ 0 + , a global solution is recovered where the integrate and fire equation is reformulated with a singular measure. This describes the dynamics after blow-up and also gives information on the blow-up phenomena itself.The major difficulty is to handle nonlinear terms. To circumvent it, we establish two new estimates, a kind of equi-integrability of the discharge measure and a L 2 estimate of the density. The use of the new timescale turns out to be fundamental for those estimates.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing effect of surface tension for the linearized MHD-Maxwell free interface problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an interface with surface tension that separates a perfectly conducting inviscid fluid from a vacuum. The fluid flow is governed by the equations of ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), while the electric and magnetic fields in vacuum satisfy the Maxwell equations. With boundary conditions on the interface this forms a nonlinear hyperbolic problem with a characteristic free boundary. For the corresponding linearized problem we derive an energy a priori estimate in a conormal Sobolev space without assuming any stability conditions on the unperturbed flow. This verifies the stabilizing effect of surface tension because, as was shown in [Mandrik and Trakhinin, in Commun. Math. Sci. 12 (2014), 1065-1100], a sufficiently large vacuum electric field can make the linearized problem ill-posed for the case of zero surface tension. The main ingredients in proving the energy estimate are a suitable secondary symmetrization of the Maxwell equations in vacuum and making full use of the boundary regularity enhanced from the surface tension.</description>

      <title>From Stochastic Zakharov System to Multiplicative Stochastic Nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of a Zakharov system driven by a time white noise, colored in space, to a multiplicative stochastic nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation, as the ion-sound speed tends to infinity. In the absence of noise, the conservation of energy gives bounds on the solutions, but this evolution becomes singular in the presence of the noise. To overcome this difficulty, we show that the problem may be recasted in the diffusion-approximation framework, and make use of the perturbed test-function method. We also obtain convergence in probability. The result is limited to dimension one, to avoid too much technicalities. As a prerequisite, we prove the existence and uniqueness of regular solutions of the stochastic Zakharov system.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the compressible Euler equations from the dynamics of interacting Bose gas in the hard-core limit regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of short-range interacting Bose gases with varying degrees of diluteness and interaction strength. By applying a combined mean-field and semiclassical space-time rescaling to the dynamics in both the Gross--Pitaevskii and hard-core limit regimes, we prove that the local one-particle mass, momentum, and energy densities of the many-body system can be quantitatively approximated by solutions to the compressible Euler system in the strong sense, up to the first blow-up time of the fluid description, as the number of particles tends to infinity. In the hard-core limit regime, two novel results are presented. First, we rigorously prove, for the first time, that the internal energy of the fluid takes the form $4\pi \mathfrak{c}_{0}\rho^{2}$ (equivalently, pressure $P=2\pi \mathfrak{c}_{0}\rho^{2}$), arising solely from the kinetic energy density of the many-body system, rather than the interaction energy density, marking a fundamental difference from the Gross--Pitaevskii and other mean-field regimes. Second, the newly discovered coupling constant $\mathfrak{c}_{0}$ is the electrostatic capacity of the interaction potential, corresponding to the scattering length of the hard-core potential. Furthermore, in other limiting regimes, including those beyond the Gross--Pitaevskii regime, we find that the limiting equation is described by an eikonal system, offering a rigorous first-principle justification for using the ``geometric optics approximation'' to describe the dynamics of ultracold Bose gases.</description>

      <title>A phase field model of Cahn-Hilliard type for tumour growth with mechanical effects and damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new diffuse interface model for tumour growth in the presence of a nutrient, in which we take into account mechanical effects and reversible tissue damage. The highly nonlinear PDEs system mainly consists of a Cahn-Hilliard type equation that describes the phase separation process between healthy and tumour tissue coupled to a parabolic reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient and a hyperbolic equation for the balance of forces, including inertial and viscous effects. The main novelty of this work is the introduction of cellular damage, whose evolution is ruled by a parabolic differential inclusion. In this paper, we prove a global-in-time existence result for weak solutions by passing to the limit in a time-discretised and regularised version of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and multiplicity of Cantor families of small amplitude analytic in time periodic solutions of the completely resonant cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation on $\mathbb{S}^3$ for an asymptotically full measure set of frequencies close to 1. The solutions are constructed by a Lyapunov-Schmidt decomposition and a Nash-Moser iterative scheme. We first find non-degenerate solutions of the Kernel equation. Then we solve the Range equation with a Nash-Moser iterative scheme to overcome small divisors problems.</description>

      <title>Absence of dead-core formations in chemotaxis systems with degenerate diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a chemotaxis system with signal consumption and degenerate diffusion of the form \begin{align*} \left\lbrace \begin{array}{r@{}l@{\quad}l} &amp;u_t=\nabla\cdot\big(D(u)\nabla u-uS(u)\nabla v\big)+f(u,v),\\ &amp;v_t=\Delta v- uv,\\ \end{array}\right. \end{align*} in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with smooth boundary subjected to no-flux and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Herein, the diffusion coefficient $D\in C^0([0,\infty))\cap C^2((0,\infty))$ is assumed to satisfy $D(0)=0$, $D(s)&gt;0$ on $(0,\infty)$, $D'(s)\geq 0$ on $(0,\infty)$ and that there are $s_0&gt;0$, $p&gt;1$ and $C_D&gt;0$ such that $$s D'(s)\leq C_D D(s)\quad\text{and}\quad C_D s^{p-1}\leq D(s)\quad\text{for }s\in[0,s_0].$$ The sensitivity function $S\in C^2([0,\infty))$ and the source term $f\in C^{1}([0,\infty)\times[0,\infty))$ are supposed to be nonnegative.
  We show that for all suitably regular initial data $(u_0,v_0)$ satisfying $u_0\geq \delta_0&gt;0$ and $v_0\not\equiv 0$ there is a time-local classical solution and - despite the degeneracy at $0$ - the solution satisfies an extensibility criterion of the form $$\text{either}\quad T_{max}=\infty,\quad\text{or}\quad\limsup_{t\nearrow T_{max}}\|u(\cdot,t)\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}=\infty.$$ Moreover, as a by-product of our analysis, we prove that a classical solution on $\Omega\times(0,T)$ obeying $\|u(\cdot,t)\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\leq M_u$ for all $t\in(0,T)$ and emanating from initial data $(u_0,v_0)$ as specified above remains strictly positive throughout $\Omega\times(0,T)$, i.e. one can find $\delta_u=\delta_u(T,\delta_0, M_u,\|v_0\|_{W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)})&gt;0$ such that $$u(x,t)\geq\delta_u\quad\text{for all }(x,t)\in\Omega\times(0,T).$$ Together, the results indicate that the formation of a dead-core in these chemotaxis systems with a degenerate diffusion are impossible before the blow-up time.</description>

      <title>Delaunay-like compact equilibria in the liquid drop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The liquid drop model was introduced by Gamow in 1928 and Bohr-Wheeler in 1938 to model atomic nuclei. The model describes the competition between the surface tension, which keeps the nuclei together, and the Coulomb force, corresponding to repulsion among protons. More precisely, the problem consists of finding a surface $\Sigma =\partial \Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is critical for the energy
  $$
  E(\Omega) = {\rm Per\,} (\Omega ) + \frac 12 \int_\Omega\int_\Omega \frac {dxdy}{|x-y|}
  $$
  under the volume constraint $|\Omega| = m$. The term ${\rm Per\,} (\Omega ) $ corresponds to the surface area of $\Sigma$. The associated Euler-Lagrange equation is
  $$
  H_\Sigma (x) + \int_{\Omega } \frac {dy}{|x-y|} = \lambda \quad \hbox{ for all } x\in \Sigma, \quad
  $$
  where $H_\Sigma$ stands for the mean curvature of the surface, and where $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated to the constraint $|\Omega|=m$. Round spheres enclosing balls of volume $m$ are always solutions. They are minimizers for sufficiently small $m$. Since the two terms in the energy compete, finding non-minimizing solutions can be challenging. We find a new class of compact, embedded solutions with large volumes, whose geometry resembles a "pearl necklace" with an axis located on a large circle, with a shape close to a Delaunay's unduloid surface of constant mean curvature. The existence of such equilibria is not at all obvious, since for the closely related constant mean curvature problem $H_\Sigma = \lambda$, the only compact embedded solutions are spheres, as stated by the classical Alexandrov result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a refined description of the dominant spectrum of a non-local operator that models growth and equal mitosis of cells. More precisely we look at the spectrum in half planes at the right hand side of the first accumulation point of eigenvalues and give criteria on the weight of weighted $L^1$ spaces for this spectrum to be made of explicit simple eigenvalues. The method relies on a high order long time asymptotic expansion of the solutions to the associated evolution equation obtained in [Zaidi, van Brunt, Wake, Proc. A, R. Soc. Lond., 2015] combined with a Weyl theorem taken from [Mischler, Scher, Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e, Anal. Non Lin\'eaire, 2016].</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity for a spectral optimal partition problem with volume and inclusion constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a complete characterization of the free boundary of a particular solution to the following spectral $k$-partition problem with measure and inclusion constraints: \[ \inf \left\{\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_1(\omega_i)\; : \; \omega_i \subset \Omega \mbox{ are nonempty open sets for all } i=1,\ldots, k,\;
  \omega_i \cap \omega_j = \emptyset \: \text{for all}\: i \not=j \mbox{ and } \sum_{i=1}^{k}|\omega_i| = a \right\}, \] where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^N$, $a\in (0,|\Omega|)$. In particular, we prove free boundary conditions, classify contact points, characterize the regular and singular part of the free boundary (including branching points), and describe the interaction of the partition with the fixed boundary $\partial \Omega$.
  The proof is based on a perturbed version of the problem, combined with monotonicity formulas, blowup analysis and classification of blowups, suitable deformations of optimal sets and eigenfunctions, as well as the improvement of flatness of [Russ-Trey-Velichkov, CVPDE 58, 2019] for the one-phase points, and of [De Philippis-Spolaor-Velichkov, Invent. Math. 225, 2021] at two-phase points.</description>

      <title>Almost anomalous dissipation in advection-diffusion of a divergence-free passive vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the advection-diffusion of a passive vector described by $\partial_t u + U \cdot \nabla u = - \nabla p + \nu \Delta u$, where both $U$ and $u$ are divergence-free velocity fields. We approach this equation from an input/output perspective, with $U$ as the input and $u$ as the output. This input/output viewpoint has been widely applied in recent studies on passive scalar equation, in the context of anomalous dissipation, mixing, optimal scalar transport, and nonuniqueness problems. What makes the passive vector equation considerably more challenging compared to the passive scalar equation is the lack of a Lagrangian perspective due to the presence of pressure.
  In this paper, rather than requiring $U$ and $u$ to be identical (as in the Navier-Stokes equation), we require $U$ and $u$ to be identical only in certain characteristics. We focus on the case where the characteristics in question are anomalous and enhanced dissipation. We study the advection-diffusion of a passive vector in a Couette flow configuration. The main result of this paper is a construction of the velocity field $U$ for which the energy dissipation scales as $(\log \nu^{-1})^{-2}$ such that the energy dissipation in velocity field $u$ scales at least as $(\log \nu^{-1})^{-2}$. This means that both $U$ and $u$ exhibit near-anomalous dissipation, where the rate of energy dissipation decreases more slowly than any power-law $\nu^{\alpha}$ for any $\alpha &gt; 0$. The result in this paper is not just a mathematical construct; it closely resembles the behavior of turbulent flow in a channel. The $(\log \nu^{-1})^{-2}$ decrease of energy dissipation is predicted by phenomenological theories of wall-bounded turbulence, a prediction that has been extensively validated through experiments and numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to the existence of positive and multiple normalized solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger equations with general nonlinearities in star-shaped bounded domains. We obtain a normalized ground state by searching for a local minimizer. Furthermore, relying on a monotonicity trick, we get another positive normalized solution by Mountain Pass theorem, and multiple solutions by establishing some special links. Moreover, we obtain the existence of nonradial normalized solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger equations in balls. The assumptions on the nonlinearities in this paper are (almost) optimal, and the results in this paper are latest for the normalized solutions of Schr\"{o}dinger equations in bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Solutions at vacuum and rarefaction waves in pressureless Euler alignment system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct global-in-time weak solutions to the pressureless Euler alignment system posed on the whole line and supplemented with initial conditions, where an initial density is an arbitrary, nonnegative, bounded, and integrable function (hence density at vacuum is allowed) and the corresponding initial velocity is determined by certain inequalities. Moreover, our setting covers the case where solutions to the pressureless Euler alignment system are known to be non-smooth. We also study an asymptotic behavior of constructed solutions and we show that, under a suitable rescaling, the density looks like a uniform distribution on a bounded, time dependent, expanding-in-time interval and the corresponding velocity approaches a rarefaction wave (i.e. the well-known explicit solution to the inviscid Burgers equation).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the comparison principle for viscosity sub/super-solutions of degenerate subelliptic equations in non-divergence form that include the sub-elliptic infinity Laplacian and the normalized p-Laplacian. The equations are defined by a collection of vector fields satisfying H\"ormander's rank condition and are left invariant with respect to a nilpotent Lie Group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantitative unique continuation on the boundary for solutions of elliptic equations with Neumann boundary conditions for bounded potentials and boundary potentials on compact manifolds with boundary. The boundary doubling inequality is derived from the combination of local Carleman estimates and global Carleman estimates. Some special attentions are paid to overcome the regularity issues arising from this boundary value problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal boundary gradient estimates for the insulated conductivity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the boundary gradient estimate of the solution to the Neumann boundary problem when a convex insulating inclusion approaches the boundary of the matrix domain. We establish upper and lower bounds on the gradient as the distance between the inclusion and the boundary, denoted as $\varepsilon$, approaches to zero. The optimal blow up rates of the gradient are proved to be always of order $\epsilon^{-1/2}$ for general strictly convex inclusions in dimensions $n\geq3$. This blow up rate was previously known to be sharp in dimension $n=2$ (see Ammari et al.\cite{AKLLL}). However, the sharp blowup rate remains unsolved in dimensions $n\geq3$. In this paper, we solve this problem and specify the impact of the boundary data on the gradient. Several new difficulties are overcome and the impact of the boundary data on the gradient is specified.This result highlights a significant difference in blow-up rates compared to the interior estimates in recent works (see \cites{LY,Weinkove,DLY,DLY2,LZ}), where the optimal rate is $\epsilon^{-1/2+\beta(n)}$, with $\beta(n)\in(0,1/2)$ varying with dimension $n\geq3$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gradient does not blow up for the corresponding Dirichlet boundary problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of the spectral shift function (SSF) for some dispersive self-adjoint operators under suitable compact perturbations. New mechanisms allowing the SSF to have singularities at the thresholds are exhibited, based on the degeneracy of the spectrum of the unperturbed operator. In particular, we show how any desired type of singularities can be engineered in this situation. These results are completed by Levinson type results.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence for mean field control with common noise and degenerate idiosyncratic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the convergence problem in the setting of mean field control with common noise and degenerate idiosyncratic noise. Our main results establish a rate of convergence of the finite-dimensional value functions $V^N$ towards the mean field value function $U$. In the case that the idiosyncratic noise is constant (but possibly degenerate), we obtain the rate $N^{-1/(d+7)}$, which is close to the conjectured optimal rate $N^{-1/d}$, and improves on the existing literature even in the non-degenerate setting. In the case that the idiosyncratic noise can be both non-constant and degenerate, the argument is more complicated, and we instead find the rate $N^{-1/(3d + 19)}$. Our proof strategy builds on the one initiated in [Daudin, Delarue, Jackson - JFA, 2024] in the case of non-degenerate idiosyncratic noise and zero common noise, which consists of approximating $U$ by more regular functions which are almost subsolutions of the infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equation solved by $U$. Because of the different noise structure, several new steps are necessary in order to produce an appropriate mollification scheme. In addition to our main convergence results, we investigate the case of zero idiosyncratic noise, and show that sharper results can be obtained there by purely control-theoretic arguments. We also provide examples to demonstrate that the value function is sensitive to the choice of admissible controls in the zero noise setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the small noise asymptotic for stochastic Burgers equations on $(0,1)$ with Dirichlet boundary condition. We consider the case that the noise is more singular than space-time white noise. We let the noise magnitude $\sqrt{\epsilon} \rightarrow 0$ and the covariance operator $Q_\epsilon$ is convergent to $(-\Delta)^{\frac 1 2}$ and prove a large deviations principle for solutions, uniformly with respect to the initial value of equation. Furthermore, we set $Q_\epsilon$ to be a trace class operator and converge to $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ in a suitable way such that the invariant measures exist. Then, we prove the large deviations principle for the invariant measures of stochastic Burgers equations.</description>

      <title>p and hp Spectral Element Methods for Elliptic Boundary Layer Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider p and hp least-squares spectral element methods for one-dimensional elliptic boundary layer problems. We derive stability estimates and design a numerical scheme based on minimizing the residuals in the sense of least squares in appropriate Sobolev norms. We prove parameter robust uniform error estimates i.e. error in the approximation is independent of the boundary layer parameter. For the p-version we prove a robust uniform convergence rate of O(sqrt(log W)/W) in the H2-norm, where W denotes the polynomial order used in approximation and for the hp-version the convergence rate is shown to be O(e^(-W/logW)). Numerical results are presented for a number of model elliptic boundary layer problems confirming the theoretical estimates and uniform convergence results for the p and hp versions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical results of the formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein vacuum equation relying on the geodesic foliation, rather than the double null foliation used in all previous results, starting with the seminal work of Christodoulou \cite{Chr1} and continued in \cite{KRodn}, \cite{An}, \cite{AnLuk}, \cite{KLR}, \cite{An1}. The main advantage of the method is that it only requires information on the incoming curvature along the incoming initial null hypersurface. The result is based on a version of the non-integrable PT frame introduced in \cite{KS:Kerr} and \cite{GKS}, associated to the geodesic foliation.</description>

      <title>$\bar{\partial}$-problem for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and soliton shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider soliton gas solutions of the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, where the point spectrum of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator condensate in a bounded domain $\mathcal{D}$ in the upper half-plane. We show that the corresponding inverse scattering problem can be formulated as a $\overline{\partial}$-problem on the domain. We prove the existence of the solution of this $\overline{\partial}$-problem by showing that the $\tau$-function of the problem (a Fredholm determinant) does not vanish. We then represent the solution of the NLS equation via the $\tau$ of the $\overline{\partial}$- problem. Finally we show that, when the domain $\mathcal{D}$ is an ellipse and the density of solitons is analytic, the initial datum of the Cauchy problem is asymptotically step-like oscillatory, and it is described by a periodic elliptic function as $x \to - \infty$ while it vanishes exponentially fast as $x \to +\infty$.</description>

Abstract: This paper constructs sequences of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equations with non-zero (but small) mass term on the product of a 2-dimensional torus with a Riemann surface of genus greater than 1. These are divergent sequences (modulo principle bundle automorphisms) that converge after renormalization to define an 'interesting' $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ harmonic 2-form data set. This data set consists of a non-empty, codimension 2 submanifold, a real line bundle defined on the complement of that submanifold with no extension across it, and a self-dual, harmonic 2-form with values in that line bundle that does not extend over the submanifold. Even so, the norm of this 2-form does extend as a H\"older continuous function with that submanifold being its zero locus.</description>

Abstract: In any closed smooth Riemannian manifold of dimension at least three, we use the min-max construction to find anisotropic minimal hyper-surfaces with respect to elliptic integrands, with a singular set of codimension~$2$ vanishing Hausdorff measure. In particular, in a closed $3$-manifold, we obtain a smooth anisotropic minimal surface.
  The critical step is to obtain a uniform upper bound for density ratios in the anisotropic min-max construction. This confirms a conjecture by Allard [Invent. Math., 1983].</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability and asymptotic behavior of periodic wave trains in reaction-diffusion systems against $C_{\mathrm{ub}}$-perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nonlinear stability theory for periodic wave trains in reaction-diffusion systems, which relies on pure $L^\infty$-estimates only. Our analysis shows that localization or periodicity requirements on perturbations, as present in the current literature, can be completely lifted. Inspired by previous works considering localized perturbations, we decompose the semigroup generated by the linearization about the wave train and introduce a spatio-temporal phase modulation to capture the most critical dynamics, which is governed by a viscous Burgers' equation. We then aim to close a nonlinear stability argument by iterative estimates on the corresponding Duhamel formulation, where, hampered by the lack of localization, we must rely on diffusive smoothing to render decay of the semigroup. Yet, this decay is not strong enough to control all terms in the Duhamel formulation. We address this difficulty by applying the Cole-Hopf transform to eliminate the critical Burgers'-type nonlinearities. Ultimately, we establish nonlinear stability of diffusively spectrally stable wave trains against $C_{\mathrm{ub}}$-perturbations. Moreover, we show that the perturbed solution converges to a modulated wave train, whose phase and wavenumber are approximated by solutions to the associated viscous Hamilton-Jacobi and Burgers' equation, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Liouville equation with quantized singular sources, the non-simple blowup phenomenon has been a major difficulty for years. It was conjectured by the first two authors that the non-simple blowup phenomenon does not occur if the equation is defined on the unit ball with Dirichlet boundary condition. In this article we not only completely settle this conjecture in its entirety, but also extend our result to cover any bounded domain. Since the main theorem in this article rules out the non-simple phenomenon in commonly observed applications, it may pave the way for advances in degree counting programs, uniqueness of blowup solutions and construction of solutions, etc.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the mass density using only the ${\mathtt{p}}$-parts of the elastic fields generated by injected highly dense small inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reconstruction method to extract the variable mass density from the elastic farfields, with a single incident direction, measured before and after injecting highly dense small scaled inclusions. We take as a model, the Lam\'e system where the mass density is the unknown in $\Omega$ and the Lam\'e parameters are known constants. The injected small/dense inclusion, $D:=z +a B\, (\subset\subset \Omega)$ with $z$ as its location, $a\ll 1$ as its maximum radius and $B$ of unit volume, generates a sequences of resonant frequencies. These special frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the Lam\'e volume integral operator defined on the domain of the inclusion and thus are, in principle, computable. After injecting the small inclusion at a location point $z$, we send an elastic incident plane wave at an incident frequency close to one of the mentioned resonant frequencies, say $\omega_{n_0}$. Contrasting the ($\mathtt{p}$-parts of the) farfields generated, at one incident direction, before and after injecting this small inclusion, we provide an explicit formula that allows us to recover the total field $V^{t,\mathtt{p}}(z,-\hat{x})$ corresponding to $\mathtt{p}$-incident waves at the location $z$. This total field is generated in the absence of the inclusion. Then we repeat the experiment by injecting more inclusions inside $\Omega$. Using this reconstructed field in the Lam\'e PDE system, via a numerical differentiation, we recover the values of the mass density inside $\Omega$. It is worth mentioning that, we use measurements of dimension 3 to recover a function of 3 dimensions freedom. This makes the inverse problem not over determined. In addition, we use only the pressure wave and the $\mathtt{p}$-part of the farfield, for the reconstruction. To our best knowledge, this is the first result using only one type of elastic waves for the parameter identification.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Acoustic Waves Generated by Multiple Resonant Bubbles: Application to Acoustic Cavitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the ultrasound waves reflected by multiple bubbles in the linearized time-dependent acoustic model. The generated time-dependent wave field is estimated close to the bubbles. The motivation of this study comes from the therapy modality using acoustic cavitation generated by injected bubbles into the region of interest. The goal is to create enough, but not too much, pressure in the region of interest to eradicate anomalies in that region. Here, we derive the dominant part of the generated acoustic field by a cluster of bubbles taking into account the (high) contrasts of their mass density and bulk as well as their general distribution in the given region. As consequences of these approximations, we highlight the following features: 1. If we use dimers (two close bubbles), or generally polymers, then we obtain a remarkable enhancement of the whole echo in the whole time. 2. If we distribute the bubbles every where in the region of interest,then we can derive the effective acoustic model which turns out to be a dispersive one. We show that, for a given desired pressure, we can tune the effective model to generate it.</description>

      <title>On the kinetic description of the objective molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a multiscale hierarchy framework for objective molecular dynamics (OMD), a reduced order molecular dynamics with a certain symmetry, that connects it to the statistical kinetic equation, and the macroscopic hydrodynamic model. In the mesoscopic regime, we exploit two interaction scalings that lead, respectively, to either a mean-field type or to a Boltzmann type equation. It turns out that, under the special symmetry of OMD, the mean-field scaling results in vastly simplified dynamics that extinguishes the underlying molecular interaction rule, whereas the Boltzmann scaling yields a meaningful reduced model called the homo-energetic Boltzmann equation. At the macroscopic level, we derive the corresponding Euler and Navier-Stokes systems by conducting a detailed asymptotic analysis. The symmetry again significantly reduces the complexity of the resulting hydrodynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Robin Hood model versus Sheriff of Nottingham model: transfers in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of transfers in a population structured by a continuous variable corresponding to the quantity being transferred. The model takes the form of an integro-differential equations with kernels corresponding to the specific rules of the transfer process. We focus our interest on the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem in the space of measures. We characterize transfer kernels that give a continuous semiflow in the space of measures and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the space $L^1$ of integrable functions. We construct some examples of kernels that may be particularly interesting in economic applications. Our model considers blind transfers of economic value (e.g. money) between individuals. The two models are the ``Robin Hood model'', where the richest individual unconditionally gives a fraction of their wealth to the poorest when a transfer occurs, and the other extreme, the ``Sheriff of Nottingham model'', where the richest unconditionally takes a fraction of the poorest's wealth. Between these two extreme cases is a continuum of intermediate models obtained by interpolating the kernels. We illustrate those models with numerical simulations and show that any small fraction of the ``Sheriff of Nottingham'' in the transfer rules leads to a segregated population with extremely poor and extremely rich individuals after some time. Although our study is motivated by economic applications, we believe that this study is a first step towards a better understanding of many transfer phenomena occurring in the life sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present weighted estimates and higher order asymptotic expansions of global solutions to the complex Ginzburg--Landau (CGL) type equation in the super Fujita-critical case. Our approach is based on commutation relations between the CGL semigroup and monomial weights in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for the weighted estimates and on the Taylor expansions with respect to the both space and time variables for the asymptotic expansions. We also characterize the optimal decay rate in time of the remainder for the asymptotic expansion from the viewpoint of the moments of the initial data in space and those of the nonlinear term in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Elasticity between manifolds: the weakly-incompatible limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via $\Gamma$-convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies $(M,g_\varepsilon)$ in an ambient space $(S,s)$, for Riemannian metrics $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$ such that $g_\varepsilon \to s$. Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between $g_\varepsilon$ and $s$, using recent results of Kupferman and Leder. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if $(S,s)$ satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke--James--M\"uller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when $(S,s)$ is a round sphere.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of peakons for the $b$-family of Novikov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with a one-parameter family of peakon equations with cubic nonlinearity parametrized by a parameter usually denoted by the letter $b$. This family is called the ``$b$-Novikov'' since it reduces to the integrable Novikov equation in the case $b=3$. By extending the corresponding linearized operator defined on functions in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ to one defined on weaker functions on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, we prove spectral and linear instability on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ of peakons in the $b$-Novikov equations for any $b$. We also consider the stability on $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ and show that the peakons are spectrally or linearly stable only in the case $b=3$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the non-degeneracy of solutions to a fractional and singular Liouville equation defined on the whole real line in presence of a singular term. We use conformal transformations to rewrite the linearized equation as a Steklov eigenvalue problem posed in a bounded domain, which is defined either by an intersection or a union of two disks. We conclude by proving the simplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effective behavior of random, heterogeneous, anisotropic, second order phase transitions energies that arise in the study of pattern formations in physical-chemical systems. Specifically, we study the asymptotic behavior, as $\epsilon$ goes to zero, of random heterogeneous anisotropic functionals in which the second order perturbation competes not only with a double well potential but also with a possibly negative contribution given by the first order term. We prove that, under suitable growth conditions and under a stationarity assumption, the functionals $\Gamma$-converge almost surely to a surface energy whose density is independent of the space variable. Furthermore, we show that the limit surface density can be described via a suitable cell formula and is deterministic when ergodicity is assumed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove Brezis--Browder type results for homogeneous fractional Sobolev spaces $\mathring{H}^s(\R^d)$ and quantitive type estimates for $s$--harmonic functions. Such outcomes give sufficient conditions for a linear and continuous functional $T$ defined on $\mathring{H}^s(\R^d)$ to admit (up to a constant) an integral representation of its norm in terms of the Coulomb type energy $$\|T\|^2_{\mathring{H}^{-s}(\R^d)}=\int_{\R^d}\int_{\R^d}\frac{T(x)T(y)}{|x-y|^{d-2s}}dx dy, $$ and for distributional solutions of $(-\Delta)^su=T$ on $\R^d$ to be of the form $$u(x)=\int_{\R^d}\frac{T(y)}{|x-y|^{d-2s}}dy+l, \quad l\in \R. $$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the family of semilinear parabolic problems \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} u_{t}(x,t) = \Delta u(x,t) - au(x,t) + f(u(x,t)), \,\,\, x \in \Omega_{\epsilon}, t &gt; 0, \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial N} (x,t) = g(u(x,t)), \,\,\, x \in \partial \Omega_{\epsilon}, t &gt; 0, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*}
  where $a &gt; 0$, $\Omega$ is the unit square, $\Omega_{\epsilon} = h_{\epsilon}(\Omega)$, $h_{\epsilon}$ is a family of $C^{m}$ - diffeomorphisms, $m \geq 1$, which converge to the identity of $\Omega$ in $C^{\alpha}$ norm, if $\alpha &lt;1$ but do not converge in the $C^{1}$ - norm and, $f,g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are real functions.
  We show that a weak version of this problem, transported to the fixed domain $\Omega$ by a ``pull-back'' procedure, is well posed for $0 &lt;\epsilon \leq \epsilon_{0}$, $\epsilon_{0} &gt; 0$, in a suitable phase space, the associated semigroup has a global attractor $\mathcal{A}_{\epsilon}$ and the family $\{ \mathcal{A}_{\epsilon} \}_{0 \, &lt; \, \epsilon \, \leq \, \epsilon_{0}}$ converges as $\epsilon \to 0$ to the attractor of the limiting problem:
  \begin{equation*}\ \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} u_{t}(x,t) = \Delta u(x,t) - au(x,t) + f(u(x,t)), \,\,\, x \in \Omega, t &gt; 0, \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial N} (x,t) = g(u(x,t))\mu, \,\,\, x \in \partial \Omega, t &gt; 0, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\mu$ is essentially the limit of the Jacobian determinant of the diffeomorphism ${h_{\epsilon}}_{| \partial \Omega} : \partial \Omega \rightarrow \partial h_{\epsilon}(\Omega)$ (but does not depend on the particular family $h_{\epsilon})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the fractional Allen--Cahn energy functional in bounded domains with prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions.
  When the fractional power $s \in (0,\frac12)$, we establish establish the first-order asymptotic development up to the boundary in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence. In particular, we prove that the first-order term is the nonlocal minimal surface functional. Also, we show that, in general, the second-order term is not properly defined and intermediate orders may have to be taken into account.
  For $s \in [\frac12,1)$, we focus on the one-dimensional case and we prove that the first order term is the classical perimeter functional plus a penalization on the boundary. Towards this end, we establish existence of minimizers to a corresponding fractional energy in a half-line, which provides itself a new feature with respect to the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Existence and Regularity Results for a Nonlinear Fluid-Structure Interaction Problem with Three-Dimensional Structural Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a nonlinear fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem involving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid in a 3D domain interacting with a thin viscoelastic lateral wall. The wall's elastodynamics is modeled by a two-dimensional plate equation with fractional damping, accounting for displacement in all three directions. The system is nonlinearly coupled through kinematic and dynamic conditions imposed at the time-varying fluid-structure interface, whose location is not known a priori. We establish three key results, particularly significant for FSI problems that account for vector displacements of thin structures. Specifically, we first establish a hidden spatial regularity for the structure displacement, which forms the basis for proving that self-contact of the structure will not occur within a finite time interval. Secondly, we demonstrate temporal regularity for both the structure and fluid velocities, which enables a new compactness result for three-dimensional structural displacements. Finally, building on these regularity results, we prove the existence of a local-in-time weak solution to the FSI problem. This is done through a constructive proof using time discretization via the Lie operator splitting method. These results are significant because they address the well-known issues associated with the analysis of nonlinearly coupled FSI problems capturing vector displacements of elastic/viscoelastic structures in 3D, such as spatial and temporal regularity of weak solutions and their well-posedness.</description>

      <title>The Isometric Immersion of Negatively Curved Surfaces with Finite Total Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the smooth isometric immersion of a complete, simply connected surface with a negative Gauss curvature into the three-dimensional Euclidean space. A fundamental and longstanding problem is to find a sufficient condition for a complete negatively curved surface to be isometrically embedded in R^3 [67]. It can be described as an initial and/or boundary value problem for a hyperbolic system of nonlinear partial differential equations derived from the Gauss-Codazzi equations. The mathematical theory associated with this system is largely incomplete. The global smooth isometric immersion has been proven in the literature when the Gauss curvature decays rapidly and monotonically. However, when the Gauss curvature oscillates or decays slowly, the problem becomes much more challenging and little is known. In our paper, we find a sufficient condition, consisting of a finite total Gauss curvature and appropriate oscillations of the Gauss curvature. Under this condition we prove the global existence of a smooth solution to the Gauss-Codazzi system, achieving a global smooth isometric immersion of the surface into R^3. Furthermore, we show that the finite total Gauss curvature is necessary for the existence of a solution in a special case of the Gauss-Codazzi system. New techniques are developed to overcome the difficulties posed by the slow decay and oscillations of the Gauss curvature. By observing that certain combinations of the Riemann invariants decay faster than others, we reformulate the Gauss-Codazzi equations as a symmetric hyperbolic system and uncover a crucial structure of partial dampings. These partial dampings, along with the finite total curvature and appropriate oscillations of the Gauss curvature, enable us to obtain a global smooth solution through delicate analysis, and consequently establish a global smooth isometric immersion of such surfaces.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is steered by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is called chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, it is inferred by experimental data. We deploy a PDE-constrained optimization framework to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a class of Fourier integral operators, whose symbols lie in the multi-parameter H\"ormander class $S^{\vec m}( \mathbb{R}^\vn)$, where ~$\vec m=(m_1,m_2,\dots,m_d)$ is the order.

Abstract: It has been known since the work of Avakumov\'ic, H\"ormander and Levitan that, on any compact smooth Riemannian manifold, if $-\Delta_g \psi_\lambda = \lambda \psi_\lambda$, then $\|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^\infty} \leq C \lambda^{\frac{d-1}{4}} \|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^2}$. It is believed that, on manifolds of negative curvature, such a bound can be largely improved; however, only logarithmic improvements in $\lambda$ have been obtained so far. In the present paper, we obtain polynomial improvements over the previous bound in a generic setting, by adding a small random pseudodifferential perturbation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator.</description>

      <title>Starshaped compact hypersurfaces in warped product manifolds II: a class of Hessian type equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove the existence of one particular class of starshaped compact hypersurfaces, by deriving global curvature estimates for such hypersurfaces; this generalizes the main result in [Hypersurfaces of prescribed mixed Weingarten curvature. J. Geom. Anal. $\textbf{34}$ (2024).] from the Euclidean space to Riemannian warped products. Moreover, we show that interior second order a priori estimates for admissible solutions to the associated fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations can be readily established by similar arguments.</description>

      <title>Modulation theory of soliton-mean flow in KdV equation with box type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the KdV equation with box type initial data, the interaction between a trial soliton and large-scale dispersive mean flow is studied theoretically and numerically. The pure box initial value can cause rarefaction wave and dispersive shock wave, and can create an area of soliton train. The key to the interaction of soliton and mean flow is that the dynamic evolutions of the mean flow and the local soliton can be described by the same modulation system. The soliton modulation system is derived from the degenerations of the two-genus Whitham modulation system. Considering the influence of rarefaction wave, dispersive shock wave and soliton train on the trial soliton, in the framework of Whitham modulation theory, the equation describing the soliton trajectory and the changes in amplitude and phase shift are given explicitly. The predicted results are compared with the numerical simulations, which verifies the corrections of the theoretical analysis. The exotic interaction phenomena between soliton and mean flow found in this work have broad applications to shallow water soliton propagations and real soliton experiments in fluid dynamics.</description>
