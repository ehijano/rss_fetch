      <title>Configurable p-Neurons Using Modular p-Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) have recently been employed in neural networks (NNs) as stochastic neurons with sigmoidal probabilistic activation functions. Nonetheless, there remain a wealth of other probabilistic activation functions that are yet to be explored. Here we re-engineer the p-bit by decoupling its stochastic signal path from its input data path, giving rise to a modular p-bit that enables the realization of probabilistic neurons (p-neurons) with a range of configurable probabilistic activation functions, including a probabilistic version of the widely used Logistic Sigmoid, Tanh and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. We present spintronic (CMOS + sMTJ) designs that show wide and tunable probabilistic ranges of operation. Finally, we experimentally implement digital-CMOS versions on an FPGA, with stochastic unit sharing, and demonstrate an order of magnitude (10x) saving in required hardware resources compared to conventional digital p-bit implementations.</description>

      <title>Enabling SSI-Compliant Use of EUDI Wallet Credentials through Trusted Execution Environment and Zero-Knowledge Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The passing of the eIDAS amendment marks an important milestone for EU countries and changes how they must manage digital credentials for both public services and businesses. Italy has led in adopting eIDAS, first with CIE and SPID identity schemes, and now with the Italian Wallet (IO app) aligned to eIDAS 2.0. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a decentralized model born from the success of Distributed Ledgers, giving individuals full control over their digital identity. The current eIDAS 2.0 and its implementation acts diverge from SSI principles, rendering the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) centralized and merely user-centric, prioritizing security and legal protection over true self-sovereignty.
  This paper proposes an architecture that enables the use of IT Wallet credentials and services in an SSI-compliant environment through Trusted Execution Environments and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.</description>

      <title>Agentic Digital Twins: A Taxonomy of Capabilities for Understanding Possible Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As digital twins (DTs) evolve to become more agentic through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), they acquire capabilities that extend beyond dynamic representation of their target systems. This paper presents a taxonomy of agentic DTs organised around three fundamental dimensions: the locus of agency (external, internal, distributed), the tightness of coupling (loose, tight, constitutive), and model evolution (static, adaptive, reconstructive). From the resulting 27-configuration space, we identify nine illustrative configurations grouped into three clusters: "The Present" (existing tools and emerging steering systems), "The Threshold" (where emergent properties appear and coupling becomes constitutive), and "The Frontier" (where systems gain reconstructive capabilities).
  Our analysis explores how agentic DTs exercise performative power--not merely representing physical systems but actively participating in constituting them. Using traffic navigation systems as examples, we show how even passive tools can exhibit emergent performativity, while advanced configurations risk performative lock-in. Drawing on performative prediction theory, we trace a progression from passive tools through active steering to ontological reconstruction, examining how constitutive coupling enables systems to create self-validating realities. Understanding these configurations is essential for navigating the transformation from DTs as mirror worlds to DTs as architects of new ontologies.</description>

      <title>XR Design Framework for Early Childhood Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended Reality in early childhood education presents high-risk challenges due to children's rapid developmental changes. While augmented and virtual reality offer immersive pedagogical benefits, they often impose excessive cognitive load or sensory conflict. We introduce the Augmented Human Development (AHD) framework to model these interactions through cognitive, sensory, environmental, and developmental parameters. To ground this framework, we conducted a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) of 111 peer-reviewed studies involving children aged 3 - 8. Our findings, interpreted through the AHD lens, reveal a critical "risk vs. attention gap," where high-impact safety and security risks remain under-researched compared to short-term pedagogical gains.</description>

      <title>The cost of quantum algorithms for biochemistry: A case study in metaphosphate hydrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for ATP/metaphosphate hydrolysis, one of the most important reactions in all of biology with implications for metabolism, cellular signaling, and cancer therapeutics. In particular, we consider three algorithms for solving the ground state energy estimation problem: the variational quantum eigensolver, quantum Krylov, and quantum phase estimation. By utilizing exact classical simulation, numerical estimation, and analytical bounds, we provide a current and future outlook for using quantum computers to solve impactful biochemical and biological problems. Our results show that variational methods, while being the most heuristic, still require substantially fewer overall resources on quantum hardware, and could feasibly address such problems on current or near-future devices. We include our complete dataset of biomolecular Hamiltonians and code as benchmarks to improve upon with future techniques.</description>

      <title>Native LLM and MLLM Inference at Scale on Apple Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.</description>

      <title>Self-Sovereign Identity and eIDAS 2.0: An Analysis of Control, Privacy, and Legal Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: European digital identity initiatives are grounded in regulatory frameworks designed to ensure interoperability and robust, harmonized security standards. The evolution of these frameworks culminates in eIDAS 2.0, whose origins trace back to the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC, the first EU-wide legal foundation for the use of electronic signatures in cross-border electronic transactions. As technological capabilities advanced, the initial eIDAS 1.0 framework was increasingly criticized for its limitations and lack of comprehensiveness. Emerging decentralized approaches further exposed these shortcomings and introduced the possibility of integrating innovative identity paradigms, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) models.
  In this article, we analyse key provisions of the eIDAS 2.0 Regulation and its accompanying recitals, drawing on existing literature to identify legislative gaps and implementation challenges. Furthermore, we examine the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF), assessing its proposed guidelines and evaluating the extent to which its emerging implementations align with SSI principles.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Vehicle Routing: Realizing QAOA-based Approach on Gate-Based Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge with broad applications in logistics and transportation. In this work, we present a quantum-assisted framework that integrates the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with a link-based formulation of VRP. Our approach encodes flow conservation and subtour elimination directly into the cost Hamiltonian, preserving graph structure while minimizing resource requirements for practical hardware implementation. We design and implement the full pipeline on a gate-based quantum computer, including problem formulation, encoding, circuit synthesis, and execution on IBM Quantum System One. Experimental results on small VRP instances highlight the effects of penalty scaling, coefficient normalization, and circuit depth on solution feasibility under hardware noise. While scalability remains constrained by circuit complexity and decoherence, the study demonstrates a practical pathway for implementing VRP on quantum hardware and identifies methodological directions for advancing near-term quantum optimization.</description>
