      <title>Equilibrium in Style: A Modeling Framework on the Cash Flow and the Life Cycle of a Consumer Store</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consumer store is ubiquitous and plays an important role in our everyday lives. It is an open question why stores usually have such short life cycles (typically around 3 years in China). This paper proposes a theoretical framework based on an equilibrium in style supply of stores and style demand of consumers to characterize store cash flow (revenue), leading to a strong explanation of this puzzle. In our model, we derive that the preference shifting of consumers is the main reason for the cash flow decreasing to its break-even line over time, while the visibility broadening leads to initial growth, resulting in rainbow-shaped cash flow and its life cycle. Moreover, the intensified spatial competition will lead to an unexpected decrease in the store's cash flow, or even closure. We calibrate our model with proprietary data of three Chinese stores from three representative industries and study the relationship between customers' preference shifting and cash flow. To our knowledge, there have been no prior attempts to quantitatively model the life cycle of the store.</description>

      <title>Farkas' Lemma and Complete Indifference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a finite two player game consider the matrix of one player's payoff difference between any two consecutive pure strategies. Define the half space induced by a column vector of this matrix as the set of vectors that form an obtuse angle with this column vector. We use Farkas' lemma to show that this player can be made indifferent between all pure strategies if and only if the union of all these half spaces covers the whole vector space. This result leads to a necessary (and almost sufficient) condition for a game to have a completely mixed Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate its usefulness by providing the class of all symmetric two player three strategy games that have a unique and completely mixed symmetric Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Chasing Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic research contest, namely the chasing contest, in which two asymmetric contestants exert costly effort to accomplish two breakthroughs in a continuous-time framework. The contestants are asymmetric in that one of them is present-biased and has already achieved one breakthrough (the leader), while the other is time-consistent and needs to achieve two breakthroughs to win (the chaser). The principal can choose between two disclosure policies, which either immediately announces the first breakthrough of the chaser (public chasing contest), or only announces the contest results until its terminus (hidden chasing contest). We fully characterize the unique x-start and y-stop equilibrium of the chasing contest with the two disclosure policies, in which the leader starts working from an instant x to the end while the chaser stops exerting effort by the instant y. We further compare the asymmetric incentives of the two disclosure policies. Our results imply that the chaser will never stop earlier in the hidden chasing contest compared to its public chasing counterpart, whereas the leader works longer in the public chasing contest only if the contest permits a late deadline.</description>

      <title>A mean-field model of optimal investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for a stochastic mean-field game of optimal investment. The analysis covers both finite and infinite time horizons, and the mean-field interaction of the representative company with a mass of identical and indistinguishable firms is modeled through the time-dependent price at which the produced good is sold. At equilibrium, this price is given in terms of a nonlinear function of the expected (optimally controlled) production capacity of the representative company at each time. The proof of the existence and uniqueness of the mean-field equilibrium relies on a priori estimates and the study of nonlinear integral equations, but employs different techniques for the finite and infinite horizon cases. Additionally, we investigate the deterministic counterpart of the mean-field game under study.</description>
