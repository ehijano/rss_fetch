      <title>Light-induced Asymmetric Pseudogap below T$_\text{c}$ in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To this day, high-temperature cuprate superconductors remain an unparalleled platform for studying the competition and coexistence of emergent, static and dynamic, quantum phases of matter exhibiting high transition temperature non-s-wave superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid transport and a still enigmatic pseudogap regime. However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states.</description>

      <title>Giant critical current peak induced by pressure in kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity can coexist or compete with other orders such as magnetism or density waves. Optimizing superconductivity requires identifying competing orders that may disrupt Cooper pair coherence. Here, we use the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) to probe pressure-tuned superconductivity in the kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. As pressure destabilizes the charge-density wave (CDW) state, $I_{\rm c,sf}$ drastically enhances, peaking near the critical pressure where the CDW state is completely suppressed at zero temperature. Surprisingly, a weaker $I_{\rm c,sf}$ peak emerges within the CDW phase. Near the pressure of the weaker peak, the superconducting phase transition temperature shifts from an increasing trend with pressure to a near plateau. Our analysis suggests the possibility of a sudden change in the CDW pattern or a Lifshitz transition, highlighting the need for microscopic examinations of the CDW state for understanding the pressure evolution of superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Tetragonal Phase and Aluminum-Doping Effect in a Bilayer Nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the tetragonal phase of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ or La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is stabilized under high pressures, is responsible for high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). In this context, realization of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure could be a rational step to achieve the goal of ambient-pressure HTSC in the nickelate system. By employing the concept of Goldschmidt tolerance factor, we succeed in stabilizing the tetragonal phase by aluminum doping together with post annealing under moderately high oxygen pressure. X-ray and neutron diffractions verify the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure for the post-annealed samples La$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_x$O$_{7-\delta}$ (0.3 $\leq x \leq$ 0.5). The Al-doped samples, including the tetragonal ones, show semiconducting properties, carry localized magnetic moments, and exhibit spin-glass-like behaviors at low temperatures, all of which can be explained in terms of charge carrier localization. Furthermore, high-pressure resistance measurements on post-annealed samples reveal that even a low Al doping ($x$ = 0.05) suppresses superconductivity almost completely. This work gives information about the effect of nonmagnetic impurity on metallicity as well as superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, which would contribute to understanding the superconducting mechanism in RP nickelates.</description>

      <title>Edge-Dependent Superconductivity in Twisted Bismuth Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayers offer a compelling and, at times, confounding platform for the engineering of new twistronic materials. Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>Real-time Monitoring of Neon Film Growth for Electron-on-Neon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states coupled to superconducting circuits are a promising platform for quantum computing. Control over the formation of these charge states requires techniques to track and control the growth of solid Ne films on the circuit surface. We demonstrate a real-time Ne film-growth monitor using high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) YBCO microwave resonators. The high $T_c$ enables tracking of the film thickness near Ne's triple temperature and below. Across more than 300 solidification experiments, we find that the final Ne thickness varies stochastically from a few nm to a few $\mu$m for films solidified from the liquid phase. By increasing the driving power in the resonator, we consistently reduce the final thickness to below 100 nm. These results represent an important step toward controlled formation of Ne films for eNe qubits and highlight the broader utility of high-$T_c$ resonators for hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hund-projected Kanamori model: an effective description of Hund's metals near the Mott insulating regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hund's coupling plays a decisive role in shaping electron correlations of multi-orbital systems, giving rise to a class of materials--Hund's metals--that combine local-moment physics with metallic transport. Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals.</description>

      <title>Tungsten Germanide Single-Photon Detectors with Saturated Internal Detection Efficiency at Wavelengths up to 29 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are among the most sensitive single-photon detectors available and have the potential to transform fields ranging from infrared astrophysics to molecular spectroscopy. However, extending their performance into the mid-infrared spectral region - crucial for applications such as exoplanet transit spectroscopy and vibrational fingerprinting of molecules - has remained a major challenge, primarily due to material limitations and scalability constraints. Here, we report on the development of SNSPDs based on tungsten germanide, a novel material system that combines high infrared sensitivity with compatibility for large-scale fabrication. Our detectors exhibit saturated internal detection efficiency at wavelengths up to 29 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. This advance enables scalable, high-performance single-photon detection in a spectral region that was previously inaccessible, opening new frontiers in remote sensing, thermal imaging, environmental monitoring, molecular physics, and astronomy.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of orbital-selective superconductivity in $\gamma$-BiPd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting (SC) properties of experimentally realised $\gamma$-BiPd by solving the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations in conjunction with {\it ab initio} relativistic calculations of the electron and phonon band structures as well as electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix elements. Our study reveals that $\gamma$-BiPd possesses a complex Fermi surface (FS), consisting of two electron pockets and one hole pocket, each characterised by distinct atomic orbitals. Our key finding is that the superconductivity in $\gamma$-BiPd is primarily orbital-selective, arising from Bi $p$-orbitals, and distributed anisotropically on the FS, although contribution from Pd $d$-orbitals, particularly on the hole pocket, is also discernable. While our results show an anisotropic nature of the {\bf k}-dependent SC gap $\Delta_{\bf k}$ and EPC strength $\lambda_{\bf k}$ across the FS, calculated superconducting quasiparticle density of states $N_S$ spectra exhibit a U-shaped gap and $\Delta_{\bf k}$ distribution forms a single peak, being consistent with the spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity observed in this material. The calculated $T_c$ is $\sim$2.0 K, agreeing in order of magnitude with the experimental value of 3.3 K in $\gamma$-BiPd thin films. The predicted EPC-enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma_n$ of $0.141$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$ is similar to the experimental $\gamma_n$ value ($0.119$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$) of the isoelectronic and isostructural Bi(Pd$_{0.5}$Pt$_{0.5}$) alloy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overdoped cuprate superconductors are strange metals above their superconducting transition temperature. In such materials, the electrical resistivity has a strong linear dependence on temperature ($T$) and electrical current is not carried by electron quasiparticles as in conventional metals. Here we demonstrate that the strange metal behaviour co-exists with strongly temperature-dependent critical spin fluctuations showing dynamical scaling across the cuprate phase diagram. Our neutron scattering observations and the strange metal behaviour are consistent with a spin density wave quantum phase transition in a metal with spatial disorder in the tuning parameter. Numerical computations using a theory of spin density waves in a disordered metal yield an extended `Griffiths phase' with scaling properties in agreement with experimental observations. Thus we establish that low-energy spin excitations and spatial disorder are central to the strange metal behaviour.</description>

      <title>Crossover of Superconductivity across the antiferromagnetic end point in FeSe$_{\rm 1-x}$S$_{\rm x}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) phase diagrams of FeSe$_{\rm 1-x}$S$_{\rm x}$ were investigated by the measurements of dc magnetization ($M$) and electrical resistivity ($\rho$) under pressure, using single crystal specimens with $x$=0.04, 0.08 and 0.13. For all specimens, the $M$($T$) curves under pressure near the end point of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase are found to show a two-step diamagnetic response, which can be described as the sum of two diamagnetic components $M_1$($T$) and $M_2$($T$), indicating that two superconducting (SC) phases with different $T_{\rm c}$ values coexist within a pressure range of $\Delta$$P$$\sim$1 GPa. Moreover, the pressure dependence of the amplitudes of $M_1$($T$) and $M_2$($T$) indicates a continuous transfer of the volume fraction between the two SC phases. These behaviors suggest that a crossover of superconductivity occurs in conjunction with the emergence of AFM phase and imply that the SC phases inside and outside the AFM phase could have different origins.</description>

      <title>Exploring Charge Density Waves in two-dimensional NbSe2 with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) has garnered significant attention due to the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) down to the monolayer limit. However, realistic modeling of CDWs-capturing effects such as layer number, twist angle, and strain-remains challenging due to the high computational cost of first-principles methods. Here, we develop a physically informed workflow for training machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on the E(3)-equivariant Allegro architecture, tailored to capture the subtle structural and dynamical signatures of CDWs in mono- and bilayer NbSe$_2$.We find that while CDW lattice distortions are relatively easy to learn, modeling vibrational properties remains more challenging. It requires targeted dataset design and careful hyperparameter tuning, pushing the boundaries and testing the extensibility of current MLIP frameworks. Our MLIPs enable reliable simulations of commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, including their sensitivity to dimensionality and stacking, as well as CDW dynamics, phonons, and transition temperatures estimated via the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. This work opens new possibilities for studying and tuning CDWs in NbSe$_2$ and other two-dimensional systems, with implications for electron-phonon coupling, superconductivity, and advanced materials design.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting tsunami-like solitons with a rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductors. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator using Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger--Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with a superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with an arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we term \textit{the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) rocks}. In the Zakharov--Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions originates from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multivalued Baker--Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider their classification.</description>
