      <title>The Consequences of Rubin Observatory Time-Domain Survey Design and Host-Galaxy Contamination on the Identification of Binary Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are consequences of galaxy mergers and dominate the low-frequency gravitational wave background. Finding binary SMBHs in existing time-domain observations has proven difficult, as their periodic, electromagnetic signals can be confused with the natural variability of single quasars. In this work, we investigate the effects of host-galaxy contamination and survey design (cadence and duration) on the detectability of binary SMBHs with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We simulate millions of LSST light curves of single and binary quasars, with a distribution of quasar and host-galaxy properties motivated by empirical observations and the anticipated LSST detection space. We then apply simple sinusoidal curve fits as a potential, computationally inexpensive detection method. We find that host-galaxy contamination will increase false-positive rates and decrease binary parameter recovery rates. Lower mass, lower luminosity binary systems are most likely to be negatively affected by host galaxy contamination. We also find that monitoring duration affects binary detection more than survey effective cadence for this detection method. As the light curve duration increases, false-positive rates are suppressed and binary parameter recovery rates, especially for binary period, are improved. Increasing the light curve duration from 5 to 10 yrs shows the most dramatic improvement for successful binary detection and false-positive rejection, with additional improvement from extending the light curve duration to 20 yrs. The observation duration increase is especially critical for recovering binary periods that are longer than a decade.</description>

      <title>X-ray and radio polarimetry of the neutron star low mass X-ray binary GX 13+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the X-ray and radio polarization study of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 13+1 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and Very Large Array (VLA). Simultaneous Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations show that the source was in parts of the Z state during our IXPE observations, exhibiting moderate changes in the hardness intensity diagram. The source exhibits X-ray dips in the light curve along with hints of polarization swings between the dip and non-dip states. The X-ray spectro-polarimetry results suggest a source geometry comprising an accretion disk component representing the softer disk emission, along with a blackbody representing the harder emission from the boundary layer (BL) or a spreading layer (SL). We investigate the geometry of GX 13+1 by considering our X-ray and radio polarization findings.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts from non-resonant Alfv\'en waves and synchrotron maser emission in the magnetar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-resonant interactions between Alfv\'en waves and a relativistic plasma result in the formation of the population inversions necessary for synchrotron maser emission (SME) across a wide range of magnetisations and temperatures. We calculate the peak frequencies of the SME resulting from this interaction and show that the characteristic frequencies and energetics of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be produced in the relativistic wind of a magnetar using this mechanism. Wind Lorentz factors of $\gamma_w\gtrsim310$ are shown to be necessary to explain observed FRBs. Emission is possible at temperatures of $\theta = k_bT/mc^2\lesssim 0.02$. We further examine the periods and magnetic fields of the central magnetar and demonstrate that the optimal values of these properties align with the observed magnetar population provided that the magnetosphere is disturbed by the flaring activity. These results allow the properties of the environment such as temperature and magnetisation to be probed from the observed FRB frequency and luminosity.</description>

      <title>Assessing Universal Relations for Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars: Insights from an Interpretable Deep Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relations between stellar properties independent of the nuclear equation of state offer profound insights into neutron star physics and have practical applications in data analysis. Commonly, these relations are derived from utilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models, each of which should obey the current constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has been significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, which increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the same time, X-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available, and additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. In this study, we revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess them using a feed-forward neural network as a regression model. More specifically, we mainly propose ``deep'' EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations for rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star's global parameters, which achieve an accuracy of within $1\%$ in most cases, with only a small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While analytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the neural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in complex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the suggested network's predictions, since is based on a strong theoretical framework inspired by the field of cooperative Game Theory. Most importantly, these highly accurate universal relations empowered with the interpretability description could be used in efforts to constrain the high-density equation of state in neutron stars, with the potential to enhance our understanding as new observables emerge.</description>

      <title>Measurement of All Flavor PeV Neutrino Flux using Combined Datasets from IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has reported a deviation from the single power law in the extragalactic diffuse neutrino flux. A neural network-based event selection of contained and uncontained cascade events from IceCube, in which uncontained events have interaction vertices at the edge or outside of the detector instrumentation volume, has a factor ~3 gain in effective area over the cascade events used in the novel combined tracks and cascades selection which reported the deviation. Systematic improvements and rigorously updated modeling of the atmospheric neutrino background is incorporated into this high statistics contained and uncontained cascade event selection to clarify features of the astrophysical neutrino spectrum across energies from 1 TeV up to 100 PeV.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts by stellar wind microlensing of a faint background source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By assuming the inverse square law of solar wind plasma density as representative of other stars, it is shown that just outside a star the {\it outward} deflection of a passing radio signal at $\nu\approx 1$~GHz (which is capable of penetrating the plasma) is about 5 times larger than the gravitational inward deflection by the star, and the ensuing lens equation which takes both effects into account is a cubic polynomial with three roots and a new strong lensing caustic. The geometric optics approach is valid for a radio source size $\lesssim 1$~pc. Microlensing magnification of a steady background source occurs typically over a timescale of milliseconds, resulting in $\approx 80$ Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) per day over the whole sky, which can only perturb the isotropy of FRB distribution at the several \% level. Moreover, repeating FRBs could be triggered by the periodic interception of the line-of-sight of the background source by members of a binary system. The temporal signatures of such FRBs are consistent with the power spectrum of solar wind density fluctuations on corresponding scales, except the mean density of the wind is a few times higher than the solar value.</description>

      <title>First Ultra High Energy Neutrino Search with a Hybrid Phased and Traditional Detector in the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultrahigh energy (UHE, &gt;10 PeV) neutrino experiment at the South Pole, designed to detect neutrino-induced radio emission in ice. It consists of five independent stations, each featuring a cubic lattice of in-ice antenna clusters spaced ~30 m apart and buried ~200 m below the surface. The fifth ARA station (A5) is unique due to its central phased array string, which employs an interferometric trigger to enhance sensitivity to weak signals otherwise buried in noise. This low-threshold trigger makes ARA the first in-ice radio neutrino experiment to demonstrate a significant improvement in detecting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radio signals.
  We present progress toward the first UHE neutrino search utilizing A5's hybrid detection capability, incorporating advancements in data selection and background rejection. This analysis is the first to fully apply dedicated event selection to both components of ARA's hybrid detector, improving directional reconstruction and significantly enhancing background rejection compared to previous analyses. This approach paves the way for next-generation in-ice UHE neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Hidden Pulsars: Scintillation-Enhanced Discovery of Two Binary Millisecond Pulsars in M13 with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a sensitive acceleration search using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques on full-length and segmented data from 84 observations of the globular cluster M13 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Employing a low detection threshold (2 $\sigma$) to maximize sensitivity to faint pulsars, here we report the discovery of two binary millisecond pulsars: J1641+3627G (M13G) and J1641+3627H (M13H). Both pulsars were detected during scintillation-brightened states, revealing systems that would otherwise remain undetected. For M13G, we obtained a phase-connected timing solution spanning 6.4 years, identifying it as a black widow system with an orbital period of 0.12 days hosting an extremely low-mass companion ($\sim 9.9\times 10^{-3}~{ M}_\odot$), though no eclipses were observed. M13H, however, shows significant apparent acceleration but was detected in only 2 of 84 observations; its extremely low detection rate currently prevents constraints on orbital parameters or classification.</description>

      <title>Mergers Fall Short: Non-merger Channels Required for Galactic Heavy Element Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for $r$-process elements in the Universe. However, observations of $r$-process abundances as inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, together with chemical evolution modeling, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for the $r$-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this study, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic [Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H] abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to $r$-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast-merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic $r$-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non-merger production channels.</description>

      <title>Preferential Positron Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetized Electron-Positron-Ion Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic shocks are considered efficient accelerators of charged particles and play crucial roles in high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts and pulsar winds. This study focuses on positron accelerations in magnetized relativistic shocks in electron-positron-ion plasma. Employing one-dimensional ab initio particle-in-cell simulations, we found a preferential positron acceleration through an interaction with the wakefield associated with a precursor wave in the upstream region. Test particle simulations revealed that the selective acceleration occurs for sufficiently large amplitudes of the wakefield. The mechanism can be understood as the relativistic $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ acceleration formulated in the upstream frame. A theoretical analysis of the positron acceleration in astrophysical contexts is presented, supporting ultra-relativistic shocks in pulsar winds as a primary source for the high-energy positron excess.</description>

      <title>Constraining Active Galactic Nucleus Jets with Spectrum and Core Shift: The Case of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically model stationary and axisymmetric active galactic nucleus jets, assuming energy conservation along each magnetic flux tube. Using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and published general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parameter, and the magnetic field strength along the jet. We then infer the electron density, emission coefficient, and absorption coefficient at each point, and integrate the radiative transfer equation to compute the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the core shift of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet. Applying the method to the M87 jet, we find that the hot plasmas are injected at the altitude of seven Schwarzschild radii from the black hole (BH), that the M87 jet is likely composed of a pair plasma, and that the jet flowline geometry is quasi-parabolic as reported at much greater distances. Fitting the nonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of position, we also find that most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from the BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations consistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows a stronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an inverted SED in sub-millimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet base. It is therefore implied that contemporaneous observations of the M87 jet with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and VLBI could discriminate the jet composition and its collimation within the central 100 Schwarzschild radii.</description>

      <title>A Targeted Gamma-Ray Search of Five Prominent Galaxy Merger Systems with 17 years of Fermi-LAT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $&lt; 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.</description>

      <title>Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess morphology of dark matter in simulations of the Milky Way galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongest experimental evidence for dark matter is the Galactic Center gamma-ray excess observed by the Fermi telescope and even predicted prior to discovery as a potential dark matter signature via WIMP dark matter self-annihilations. However, an equally compelling explanation of the excess gamma-ray flux appeals to a population of old millisecond pulsars that also accounts for the observed boxy morphology inferred from the bulge old star population. We employ a set of Milky Way-like galaxies found in the Hestia constrained simulations of the local universe to explore the rich morphology of the central dark matter distribution, motivated by the GAIA discovery of a vigorous early merging history of the Milky Way galaxy. We predict a significantly non-spherical gamma-ray morphology from the WIMP interpretation. Future experiments, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array, that extend to higher energies, should distinguish between the competing interpretations.</description>

      <title>Impact of black hole spin on low-mass black hole-neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of GW230529 suggests that black hole-neutron star mergers may involve low-mass black holes, potentially producing detectable electromagnetic counterparts. Motivated by this, we perform eleven fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with and without neutrino treatment, targeting the inferred chirp mass of GW230529. We systematically vary the black hole spin from $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.0$ to $0.8$ in steps of $0.1$, making this the most comprehensive study of spin effects in black hole-neutron star mergers to date. We confirm our earlier findings of fast-moving ejecta ($v \geq 0.6\,c$) in this parameter regime and demonstrate a clear spin dependence, with fast-ejecta masses reaching up to $\qty{\sim e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$ for $a_{\mathrm{BH}} = 0.8$. Most notably, we identify for the first time the presence of spiral wave-driven ejecta in black hole-neutron star mergers -- a phenomenon previously reported only in binary neutron star systems. The mass of this component grows significantly with spin, reaching levels up to $\qty{\sim 7e-3}{\Mass\Sun}$. These results establish a new spin-enhanced mechanism for powering blue kilonova emission in black hole-neutron star mergers, significantly extending the range of systems expected to produce observable electromagnetic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Transport of Particles in Strongly Turbulent 3D Magnetized Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we examine particle transport in strongly turbulent three-dimensional (3D) magnetized plasmas, characterized by intense (large-amplitude) magnetic field fluctuations. Such environments naturally give rise to a network of coherent structures (CoSs), including current sheets, filaments, shocks, switchbacks, and significant magnetic perturbations, which critically influence particle dynamics at the kinetic level. Within this turbulent regime, two fundamental particle energization mechanisms emerge, stochastic acceleration and systematic acceleration. Systematic acceleration within open turbulent volumes promotes the development of power-law tails in energy distributions. Our analysis distinguishes the roles of two electric fields: the perpendicular (or convective) fields, which drive stochastic heating via interactions with randomly moving scatterers, and the parallel electric fields, which enable systematic particle acceleration in regions of strong currents. Combined with accurate estimates of particle escape times in finite volumes, the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the formation of Kappa distributions. The transport properties differ significantly between the two energization modes. Stochastic energization follows Gaussian statistics and can be effectively described by the Fokker-Planck equation. In contrast, systematic acceleration exhibits Levy flight statistics, necessitating a fractional transport equation for an accurate description. Furthermore, the fractal spatial distribution of CoSs introduces deviations from traditional transport models, influencing e.g. particle escape times. Systematic acceleration is most efficient during the early, high-energy phases of turbulence, while stochastic heating becomes dominant during the later stages, contributing to gradual particle energization.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Hyperboloidal Extraction of Gravitational Waves in 3+1 Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering, and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications. Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.</description>

      <title>Dark Sector Electroweak Baryogenesis In Light Of The Galactic Center Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a model of electroweak baryogenesis that includes a dark matter candidate, and sequesters the new CP violation required to produce the baryon asymmetry in a dark sector. The model can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry, dark matter relic density, and the long-standing excess of gamma rays from the galactic center. The first order electroweak phase transition induced by the new physics can give rise to gravitational waves that may be observed in future experiments. The model predicts dark matter signals in direct detectors, and a significant contribution to the Higgs boson invisible decay width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by future opportunities in gravitational-wave astronomy and the ongoing effort to constrain physics under extreme conditions, we consider the signature of individual mode resonances excited during the inspiral of binary systems involving neutron stars. Specifically, we quantify how each resonant mode contributes to the effective (frequency-dependent) tidal deformability. The resonant solution is shown to be accurately represented by a new closed-form approximation, which sheds light on the involved phenomenology, and which should be useful for the development of precise waveform models and future parameter extraction efforts.</description>

      <title>Axion Gamma-Ray Signatures from Quark Matter in Neutron Stars and Gravitational Wave Comparisons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.08722v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model for detecting axions from neutron stars in a QCD phase of quark matter. The axions would be produced from a quark-antiquark pair $u\bar{u}$ or $d\bar{d}$, in loop(s) involving gluons. The chiral anomaly of QCD and the spontaneously broken symmetry are invoked to explain the non-conservation of the axion current. From the coupling form factors, the axion emissivities $\epsilon_a$ can be derived, from which fluxes can be determined. We predict a photon flux, which may be detectable by Fermi LAT, and limits on the QCD mass $m_a$. In this model, axions decay to gamma rays in a 2-photon vertex. We may determine the expected fluxes from the theoretical emissivity. The sensitivity curve from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT) would allow axion mass constraints for neutron stars as low as $m_a \le 10^{-14}$ eV 95$\% C.L.$. Axions could thus be detectable in gamma rays for neutron stars as distant as 100 kpc. A signal from LIGO GWS 170817 could be placed from the NS-NS merger, which gives an upper limit of $m_a \le 10^{-10}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Inference of multi-channel r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way using binary neutron star merger observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of GW170817 strongly suggest that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers produce rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis (r-process) elements. However, it remains an open question whether these mergers can account for all the r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way's history. Here, we constrain the contributions of the BNS channel using astrophysical neutron star observations. The rate and mass distributions are constrained by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra through the latest catalog GWTC-3, the neutron star equation of state by gravitational-wave, radio, and X-ray observations, and the delay time distribution by short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy associations. We present a Bayesian framework to consistently combine these lines of observations with abundance data to quantify the contribution and uncertainties of single and multiple astrophysical enrichment sources. Whereas we obtain a distribution of per-event BNS r-process element yields consistent with geophysical and astrophysical abundance constraints, BNS-only enrichment scenarios are inconsistent with the observed r-process abundance trend of disk stars in the Galaxy. Using stellar abundance observations instead of the short GRB constraints, we infer a shorter delay time distribution with power-law index $\alpha\leq -2.0$ and minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}\leq 40$ Myr at 90\% confidence. Such delay times are in tension with those predicted by standard BNS formation models. Alternatively, we confirm that a two-channel scenario, in which the second channel tracks the star formation history without significant delay, can account for both Galactic stellar and short GRB observations. We show that 45--90\% of the r-process abundance in the Milky Way today was produced by a star-formation-tracking channel, rather than BNS mergers with significant delay times.</description>

      <title>Morphology of 35 Repeating Fast Radio Burst Sources at Microsecond Time Scales with CHIME/FRB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) project has discovered the most repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources of any telescope. However, most of the physical conclusions derived from this sample are based on data with a time resolution of $\sim$1 ms. In this work, we present for the first time a morphological analysis of the raw voltage data for 124 bursts from 35 of CHIME/FRB's repeating sources. We do not find any significant correlations amongst fluence, dispersion measure (DM), burst rate, and burst duration. Performing the first large-scale morphological comparison at timescales down to microseconds between our repeating sources and 125 non-repeating FRBs, we find that repeaters are narrower in frequency and broader in duration than non-repeaters, supporting previous findings. However, we find that the duration-normalized sub-burst widths of the two populations are consistent, possibly suggesting a shared physical emission mechanism. Additionally, we find that the spectral fluences of the two are consistent. When combined with the larger bandwidths and previously found larger DMs of non-repeaters, this suggests that non-repeaters may have higher intrinsic specific energies than repeating FRBs. We do not find any consistent increase or decrease in the DM ($\lessapprox 1$ pc cm$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) and scattering timescales ($\lessapprox 2$ ms yr$^{-1}$) of our sources over $\sim2-4$ year periods.</description>

      <title>SN 2023adsy: A normal type Ia Supernova at z=2.9</title>

Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) discovered in high-redshift (z &gt; 2) galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a unique opportunity to extend the Hubble-diagram beyond z~1.5 and constrain the cosmic Star Formation Rate in the early Universe. SN~2023adsy, a Type Ia supernova discovered by JWST at z=2.9, was found to be a peculiar event, being extremely red and faint, but showing very similar rest-frame light curve decline rate to the majority of low-redshift SNe Ia. We examine whether the red color and faint peak magnitude could also be explained by significant reddening/extinction due to dust within the host galaxy. We use the light curve fitter SALT3-NIR with templates extended to the near-infrared, to re-fit the published NIRCam photometry, assuming a "normal" SN Ia and Milky-Way dust extinction law. NIRCam photometry of the host galaxy taken before the SN discovery is also examined by comparing its Spectral Energy Distribution with galaxy templates. The NIRCam photometry can be fit reasonably well with a slowly declining, but otherwise "normal" SN Ia template suffering significant reddening ($E(B-V)_{host} \gtrsim 0.5$ mag). Photometry of the host galaxy suggests a blue, star-forming galaxy, where the presence of significant amount of dust cannot be ruled out. Comparison of the inferred luminosity distance with the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology on the Hubble-diagram suggests no significant evolution of the SN Ia peak luminosity at z&gt;2 redshifts. It is also shown that the discovery of a single SN Ia between 2 &lt; z &lt; 3 within the area of the JADES survey during 1 year is consistent with the current estimates for the SN Ia rates at such redshifts.</description>

Abstract: We present the first overview of the expected quantity of signals which will showcase significant gravitational wave phase shifts caused by astrophysical environments, considering the upcoming A+ and A\# LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. We construct and analyse two general families of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources, as well as collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun physical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for stellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical interactions. We compute the expected fraction of signals containing astrophysical dephasing, as a function of environmental properties and based on observed distributions of binary parameters. We find that next generation detectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected signals.</description>

      <title>Effects of eccentricity on accreting binary black holes: MHD simulations in full GR reveal novel periodicities in jet power and synchrotron spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform simulations of magnetohydrodynamic accretion onto equal-mass, nonspinning binary black holes in 3+1 full general relativity addressing the effects of orbital eccentricity. We find that binary black holes with non-negligible eccentricity accrete matter with periodicity that matches the binary orbital period, whereas quasicircular binaries exhibit accretion rate modulation at approximately $\sim 0.7\times$ their binary orbital period. Additionally, we find that the total jet luminosity is modulated at the orbital period for eccentric binaries, while quasicircular binaries only exhibit long-term modulations. We perform a radiative transfer calculation of the dual jet synchrotron emission and demonstrate that the optically thin synchrotron emission varies on the binary orbital period for eccentric binaries. Moreover, eccentric binaries spend more time in a {\it low} state, where the synchrotron emission is minimum, than in a {\it high} state, where the synchrotron emission peaks. The quasicircular binary also exhibits variability in its optically thin synchrotron emission but the exact frequency of variability does not appear robust against different parameters. Our suite of simulations is an essential step towards providing a comprehensive catalog of multimessenger theoretical models that will enable studies of supermassive binary black holes detectable across the electromagnetic and gravitational wave spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations for equal masses. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Extreme value distribution for gamma-ray-burst prompt data -- How unexpected was the BOAT event?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are known to be unpredictable in time and position. A few (observationally) exceptional events have been observed, as GRB221009A that stands out for its fluence and peak flux, being orders of magnitude higher than what measured so far. Analyzing the observed fluence, peak flux or duration distributions typically requires one to assume some scenarios, and the consistency of the observed data with the predictions turns out to be an important model diagnostic. However, it is also of interest to model these distributions using general statistical properties that do not rely on specific model assumptions, allowing one to derive inferences only based on the consistency of the observed distributions with the hypothesis of one single population of events that generate them. We obtained fluences, peak fluxes and durations from the catalogues of GRBs observed by the CGRO-BATSE and Fermi-GBM instruments. We selected the extreme values in slots of equal duration and modelled their distributions by the generalized extreme value (GEV) formalism. The GEV distribution is a limit distribution naturally arising when the number of observations is large and is essentially independent of the phenomena producing the observed data. The distributions of extreme values for fluences, peak fluxes and durations are consistent with being extracted from a single population of events but the fluence and peak flux recorded for GRB221009A constitutes a striking exception. The probability to observe such an event, assuming it is a cosmological GRB, is low, with a median value of about one event per millennium for the fluence and about one event per century for the peak flux.</description>

      <title>XRISM/Resolve View of Abell 2319: Turbulence, Sloshing, and ICM Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from XRISM/Resolve observations of the core of the galaxy cluster Abell 2319, focusing on its kinematic properties. The intracluster medium (ICM) exhibits temperatures of approximately 8 keV across the core, with a prominent cold front and a high-temperature region ($\sim$11 keV) in the northwest. The average gas velocity in the 3 arcmin $\times$ 4 arcmin region around the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) covered by two Resolve pointings is consistent with that of the BCG to within 40 km s$^{-1}$ and we found modest average velocity dispersion of 230-250 km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, spatially-resolved spectroscopy reveals interesting variations. A blueshift of up to $\sim$230 km s$^{-1}$ is observed around the east edge of the cold front, where the gas with the lowest specific entropy is found. The region further south inside the cold front shows only a small velocity difference from the BCG; however, its velocity dispersion is enhanced to 400 km s$^{-1}$, implying the development of turbulence. These characteristics indicate that we are observing sloshing motion with some inclination angle following BCG and that gas phases with different specific entropy participate in sloshing with their own velocities, as expected from simulations. No significant evidence for a high-redshift ICM component associated with the subcluster Abell 2319B was found in the region covered by the current Resolve pointings. These results highlight the importance of sloshing and turbulence in shaping the internal structure of Abell 2319. Further deep observations are necessary to better understand the mixing and turbulent processes within the cluster.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Black Hole Shadow with Dark Matter Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has significantly advanced our ability to study black holes, achieving unprecedented spatial resolution and revealing horizon-scale structures. Notably, these observations feature a distinctive dark shadow--primarily arising from faint jet emissions--surrounded by a bright photon ring. Anticipated upgrades of the EHT promise substantial improvements in dynamic range, enabling deeper exploration of low-background regions, particularly the inner shadow defined by the lensed equatorial horizon. Our analysis shows that observations of these regions transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for annihilating dark matter, which is expected to accumulate densely in their vicinity. By analyzing the black hole image morphology and performing electron-positron propagation calculations in realistic plasma backgrounds derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we set stringent constraints on dark matter annihilation, requiring contributions below the astrophysical emission. These constraints, derived from both current EHT observations and projections for future upgraded arrays, exclude a substantial region of previously unexplored parameter space and remain robust against astrophysical uncertainties, including black hole spin and plasma temperature variations.</description>

      <title>Inferring additional physics through unmodelled signal reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave data is often computationally expensive, requiring simplifying assumptions such as circularisation of binary orbits. Although, if included, the sub-dominant effects like orbital eccentricity may provide crucial insights into the formation channels of compact binary mergers. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline strategy leveraging minimally modelled waveform reconstruction to identify the presence of eccentricity in real time. Using injected signals, we demonstrate that ignoring eccentricity ($e_{\rm 20Hz} \gtrsim 0.1$) leads to significant biases in parameter recovery, including chirp mass estimates falling outside the 90% credible interval. Waveform reconstruction shows inconsistencies increase with eccentricity, and this behaviour is consistent for different mass ratios. Our method enables low-latency inferences of binary properties supporting targeted follow-up analyses and can be applied to identify any physical effect of measurable strength.</description>

      <title>The Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Binary Neutron Star Mergers in LIGO/Virgo/Kagra can be Constrained by Measuring Doppler Induced Gravitational Wave Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers are expected to be observed once LIGO/Virgo/Kagra reaches the planned A+ or proposed A\# sensitivity. We demonstrate that the relative transverse velocity of the source-lens system can be constrained by comparing the phase of the two associated gravitational wave (GW) images, using both semi-analytical and numerical Bayesian methods. For A+ sensitivity, a one-sigma NS-NS merger signal in magnification $(\mu=200)$ and redshift $(z_{\rm S}=1)$ will carry a marginally detectable dephasing signature for a source transverse velocity of $\sim 1800$ km/s. This is comparable to the velocity dispersion of large galaxy clusters. Assuming the same population distribution, the most likely source parameters of $\mu=100$ and $z_{\rm S}=1.4$ are always expected to showcase detectable dephasing imprints for A\# sensitivity, provided they are moving with transverse velocities larger than $\sim 2000$ km/s. We conclude that a first measurement of the relative transverse velocity of a source via GW dephasing methods is likely only a few years away.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts for the Enhanced Large Aperture Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe updated scientific goals for the wide-field, millimeter-wave survey that will be produced by the Simons Observatory (SO). Significant upgrades to the 6-meter SO Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) are expected to be complete by 2028, and will include a doubled mapping speed with 30,000 new detectors and an automated data reduction pipeline. In addition, a new photovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey will cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times the angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals are to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and constrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time universe, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of structure at $z &lt; 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy input from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a sample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study these sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid regoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate large portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a powerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to years, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between $10^{14}$ and $10^{20}$ kg are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a completely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the Sun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a PBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate the contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of frequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.</description>
