      <title>Uniformly rectifiable metric spaces satisfy the weak constant density condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak constant density condition is a quantitative regularity property originally investigated by David and Semmes in their foundational work on uniform rectifiability. Roughly speaking, a space satisfies this condition if in most balls, the space supports a measure with nearly constant density in a neighborhood of scales and locations. In this paper, we prove that uniformly rectifiable metric spaces satisfy the weak constant density condition, extending a theorem of David and Semmes. In order to do this, we first prove a slightly modified version of a separate theorem of David and Semmes which weakly controls the oscillation of the means of $L^2$ functions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Bounds for Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we bring a new perspective to persistent homology by incorporating key concepts from metric geometry. For a given compact subset $X$ of a Banach space $Y$, we study the topological features appearing in family $N_\bullet(X\subset Y)$ of nested of neighborhoods of $X$ in $Y$ and give several geometric bounds on their persistence (lifespans).
  First, we discuss the lifespans of these homology classes in terms of their filling radii in $Y$. By using this, we relate these lifespans to key invariants in metric geometry such as Urysohn width. Next, we bound these lifespans via $\ell^\infty$-principal components of the set $X$, which are also known as Kolmogorov widths. Furthermore, we introduce and study the notion of extinction time of a space $X$: the critical threshold after which there are no homological features alive in any degree. We also describe novel approaches on how to estimate \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips extinction times of a set $X$ by relating $X$ to its \"uber-contractible cores and to its tight span, respectively.</description>

      <title>Brillouin Zones of Integer Lattices and Their Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a locally finite set, $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, the $k$-th Brillouin zone of $a \in A$ is the region of points $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for which $\|x-a\|$ is the $k$-th smallest among the Euclidean distances between $x$ and the points in $A$. If $A$ is a lattice, the $k$-th Brillouin zones of the points in $A$ are translates of each other, which tile space. Depending on the value of $k$, they express medium- or long-range order in the set. We study fundamental geometric and combinatorial properties of Brillouin zones, focusing on the integer lattice and its perturbations. Our results include the stability of a Brillouin zone under perturbations, a linear upper bound on the number of chambers in a zone for lattices in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and the convergence of the maximum volume of a chamber to zero for the integer lattice.</description>

      <title>On the Dirichlet-to-Neumann Map for the $p$-Laplacian on a Metric Measure Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we construct a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, from a Besov space of functions, to the dual of this class. The Besov spaces are of functions on the boundary of a bounded, locally compact uniform domain equipped with a doubling measure supporting a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality so that this boundary is also equipped with a Radon measure that has a codimensional relationship with the measure on the domain. We construct this map via the following recipe. We show first that solutions to Dirichlet problem for the $p$-Laplacian on the domain with prescribed boundary data in the Besov space induce an operator that lives in the dual of the Besov space. Conversely, we show that there is a solution, in the homogeneous Newton-Sobolev space, to the Neumann problem for the $p$-Laplacian with the Neumann boundary data given by a continuous linear functional belonging to the dual of the Besov space. We also obtain bounds on its operator norm in terms of the norms of trace and extension operators that relate Newton-Sobolev functions on the domain to Besov functions on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Ahlfors regularity of continua that minimize maxitive set functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to establish the Ahlfors regularity of minimizers of set functions that satisfy a suitable maxitive condition on disjoint unions of sets. Our analysis focuses on minimizers within continua of the plane with finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Through quantitative estimates, we prove that the length of a minimizer inside the ball centered at one of its points is comparable to the radius of the ball. By operating within an abstract framework, we are able to encompass a diverse range of entities, including spectral functionals defined in terms of the eigenvalues of elliptic operators, the inradius, and the maximum of the torsion function. These entities are of interest for several applications, such as structural engineering, urban planning, and quantum mechanics.</description>
