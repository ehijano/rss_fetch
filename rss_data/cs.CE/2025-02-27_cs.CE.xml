      <title>Rule-based autocorrection of Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&amp;IDs) on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A piping and instrumentation diagram (P&amp;ID) is a central reference document in chemical process engineering. Currently, chemical engineers manually review P&amp;IDs through visual inspection to find and rectify errors. However, engineering projects can involve hundreds to thousands of P&amp;ID pages, creating a significant revision workload. This study proposes a rule-based method to support engineers with error detection and correction in P&amp;IDs. The method is based on a graph representation of P&amp;IDs, enabling automated error detection and correction, i.e., autocorrection, through rule graphs. We use our pyDEXPI Python package to generate P&amp;ID graphs from DEXPI-standard P&amp;IDs. In this study, we developed 33 rules based on chemical engineering knowledge and heuristics, with five selected rules demonstrated as examples. A case study on an illustrative P&amp;ID validates the reliability and effectiveness of the rule-based autocorrection method in revising P&amp;IDs.</description>

      <title>PyTorchFire: A GPU-Accelerated Wildfire Simulator with Differentiable Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and rapid prediction of wildfire trends is crucial for effective management and mitigation. However, the stochastic nature of fire propagation poses significant challenges in developing reliable simulators. In this paper, we introduce PyTorchFire, an open-access, PyTorch-based software that leverages GPU acceleration. With our redesigned differentiable wildfire Cellular Automata (CA) model, we achieve millisecond-level computational efficiency, significantly outperforming traditional CPU-based wildfire simulators on real-world-scale fires at high resolution. Real-time parameter calibration is made possible through gradient descent on our model, aligning simulations closely with observed wildfire behavior both temporally and spatially, thereby enhancing the realism of the simulations. Our PyTorchFire simulator, combined with real-world environmental data, demonstrates superior generalizability compared to supervised learning surrogate models. Its ability to predict and calibrate wildfire behavior in real-time ensures accuracy, stability, and efficiency. PyTorchFire has the potential to revolutionize wildfire simulation, serving as a powerful tool for wildfire prediction and management.</description>

      <title>FinTSB: A Comprehensive and Practical Benchmark for Financial Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial time series (FinTS) record the behavior of human-brain-augmented decision-making, capturing valuable historical information that can be leveraged for profitable investment strategies. Not surprisingly, this area has attracted considerable attention from researchers, who have proposed a wide range of methods based on various backbones. However, the evaluation of the area often exhibits three systemic limitations: 1. Failure to account for the full spectrum of stock movement patterns observed in dynamic financial markets. (Diversity Gap), 2. The absence of unified assessment protocols undermines the validity of cross-study performance comparisons. (Standardization Deficit), and 3. Neglect of critical market structure factors, resulting in inflated performance metrics that lack practical applicability. (Real-World Mismatch). Addressing these limitations, we propose FinTSB, a comprehensive and practical benchmark for financial time series forecasting (FinTSF). To increase the variety, we categorize movement patterns into four specific parts, tokenize and pre-process the data, and assess the data quality based on some sequence characteristics. To eliminate biases due to different evaluation settings, we standardize the metrics across three dimensions and build a user-friendly, lightweight pipeline incorporating methods from various backbones. To accurately simulate real-world trading scenarios and facilitate practical implementation, we extensively model various regulatory constraints, including transaction fees, among others. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on FinTSB, highlighting key insights to guide model selection under varying market conditions. Overall, FinTSB provides researchers with a novel and comprehensive platform for improving and evaluating FinTSF methods.

      <title>Validating the predictions of mathematical models describing tumor growth and treatment response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in methods to interrogate tumor biology, the observational and population-based approach of classical cancer research and clinical oncology does not enable anticipation of tumor outcomes to hasten the discovery of cancer mechanisms and personalize disease management. To address these limitations, individualized cancer forecasts have been shown to predict tumor growth and therapeutic response, inform treatment optimization, and guide experimental efforts. These predictions are obtained via computer simulations of mathematical models that are constrained with data from a patient's cancer and experiments. This book chapter addresses the validation of these mathematical models to forecast tumor growth and treatment response. We start with an overview of mathematical modeling frameworks, model selection techniques, and fundamental metrics. We then describe the usual strategies employed to validate cancer forecasts in preclinical and clinical scenarios. Finally, we discuss existing barriers in validating these predictions along with potential strategies to address them.</description>

      <title>Limits of isotropic damage models for complex load paths -- beyond stress triaxiality and Lode angle parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stress triaxiality and the Lode angle parameter are two well established stress invariants for the characterization of damage evolution. This work assesses the limits of this tuple by using it for damage predictions in a continuum damage mechanics framework. Isotropic and anisotropic formulations of two well-established models are used to avoid model-specific restrictions. The damage evolution is analyzed for different load paths, while the stress triaxiality and the Lode angle parameter are controlled. The equivalent plastic strain is moreover added as a third parameter, but still does not suffice to uniquely define the damage state. As a consequence, well-established concepts such as fracture surfaces depending on this triple have to be taken with care, if complex paths are to be investgated. These include, e.g., load paths observed during metal forming applications with varying load directions or multiple stages.</description>
