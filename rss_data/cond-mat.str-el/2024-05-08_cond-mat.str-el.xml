      <title>Pressure induced metallization and loss of surface magnetism in FeSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystalline FeSi samples with a conducting surface state (CSS) were studied under high pressure ($\textit{P}$) and magnetic field ($\textit{B}$) by means of electrical resistance ($\textit{R}$) measurements to explore how the bulk semiconducting state and the surface state are tuned by the application of pressure. We found that the energy gap ($\Delta$) associated with the semiconducting bulk phase begins to close abruptly at a critical pressure ($P_{cr}$) of ~10 GPa and the bulk material becomes metallic with no obvious sign of any emergent phases or non-Fermi liquid behavior in $\textit{R}$($\textit{T}$) in the neighborhood of $P_{cr}$ above 3 K. Moreover, the metallic phase appears to remain at near-ambient pressure upon release of the pressure. Interestingly, the hysteresis in the $\textit{R}$($\textit{T}$) curve associated with the magnetically ordered CSS decreases with pressure and vanishes at $P_{cr}$, while the slope of the $\textit{R}$($\textit{B}$) curve, d$\textit{R}$/d$\textit{B}$, which has a negative value for $\textit{P}$ &lt; $P_{cr}$, decreases in magnitude with $\textit{P}$ and changes sign at $P_{cr}$. Thus, the CSS and the corresponding two-dimensional magnetic order collapse at $P_{cr}$ where the energy gap $\Delta$ of the bulk material starts to close abruptly, revealing the connection between the CSS and the semiconducting bulk state in FeSi.</description>

      <title>Spin pumping into quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin pumping into a quantum easy-plane ferromagnetic spin chain system. This quantum spin chain is effectively described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid despite the ferromagnetic exchange interaction because of the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy. This TL liquid state has an extremely strong interaction that is hardly realized in other quantum antiferromagnetic chain systems or weakly interacting electron systems. We show how the strongly interacting TL liquid affects the ferromagnetic resonance that occurs in the ferromagnetic insulator. In particular, we discuss the dependence of the Gilbert damping on the temperature and the junction length. The Gilbert damping allows us to extract information about the above-mentioned strong interaction within the quantum ferromagnetic spin chain. We also point out that a well-known compound CsCuCl$_3$ will be suitable for the realization of our setup.</description>

      <title>Observation of an unconventional giant negative exchange bias effect in La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.85}$Nb$_{0.15}$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find an unconventional giant negative exchange bias (EB) of $H_{\rm EB}$ = --14.1~kOe at 2~K (cooling field of 50~kOe) in the cluster spin-glass (CSG) La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.85}$Nb$_{0.15}$O$_3$ perovsikte cobaltites. The magnetic memory effect, aging measurements, and nonlineraity in specific heat capacity reveal the glassy magnetic state at low temperatures. Further, the detailed analysis of {\it ac-}magnetic susceptibility confirms the glassy state below $\sim$58~K and the obtained characteristic spin-relaxation time-scale of $\tau_0$ = 8.4$\times$10$^{-10}$~s indicates the presence of CSG. Moreover, the analysis of magnetic training effect using the classical EB relaxation model reveals that the frozen spins relax slowly as compared to the rotatable spins at the interface of antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic (AFM/FM) regions in CSG. Interestingly, the dependence of EB parameters is found to be unconventional for cooling field $&gt;$50~kOe as the $H\rm_{EB}$ and $M\rm_{EB}$ show decreasing trend instead of expected saturation at higher fields. This unusual nature emerges due to large negative values of intrinsic interface exchange coupling ($J_i$), i.e., --10.24$\pm$0.22~meV and --12.55$\pm$0.49~meV for the measuring fields of $\pm$50~kOe and $\pm$90~kOe, respectively, whereas the number of spins in the FM cluster ($N_{\rm FM}$) are found to be small in the range of 2.4--3.1. These obtained values of $J_i $ and $N_{\rm FM}$ indicate the dominant AFM interactions and the presence of FM clusters in the AFM matrix, respectively, which correlate well with the observed unconventional behavior of giant negative exchange bias in the present sample.</description>

      <title>Simulating Spin Dynamics of Supersolid States in a Quantum Ising Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental study on a quantum Ising magnet $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$ where spectroscopic evidence of zero-field supersolidity is presented [arXiv: 2402.15869], we simulate the excitation spectrum of the corresponding microscopic $XXZ$ model for the compound, using the recently developed excitation ansatz of infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS). We map out the ground state phase diagram and compute the dynamical spin structure factors across a range of magnetic field strengths, focusing especially on the two supersolid phases found near zero and saturation fields. Our simulated excitation spectra for the zero-field supersolid "Y" phase are in excellent agreement with the experimental data -- recovering the low-energy branches and integer quantized excited energy levels $\omega_n=nJ_{zz}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the nonlocal multi-spin-flip features for modes at $\omega_2$, indicative of their multi-magnon nature. Additionally, we identify characteristics of the high-field supersolid "V" phase in the simulated spectra, to be compared with future experimental results.</description>

      <title>Topology and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry in a Non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Periodic Hopping Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of periodic hopping modulation on a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that exhibits non-Hermiticity in presence of an onsite staggered imaginary potential. This dissipative, non-Hermitian (NH) extension amply modifies the features of the topological trivial phase (TTP) and the topological nontrivial phase (TNP) of the SSH chain. Though a weak potential can respect the parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry keeping the energy eigenvalues real, a strong potential breaks $\mathcal{PT}$ conservation leading to imaginary end state and complex bulk state energies in the system. Furthermore for large commensurate periodicity of the hopping, in-gap states appear that take either purely real or purely imaginary eigenvalues depending on the strenth of both NH potential and hopping modulation. In particular, this paper is engaged with hopping periodicities of 2, 4 and 8 lattice spacings. The localization of end states and in-gap states at the boundaries are investigated for those hopping periodicities. Though we find that topology and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry are not very directly connected, distinguishing distribution of $\mathcal{PT}$ broken and unbroken phases are clearly observed within TNP and TTP in our systems.</description>

      <title>Non-anomalous non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D from gapped boundaries of SymTFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the anomalies of non-invertible symmetries in 1+1D QFTs using gapped boundaries of its SymTFT. We establish the explicit relation between Lagrangian algebras which determine gapped boundaries of the SymTFT, and algebras which determine non-anomalous/gaugeable topological line operators in the 1+1D QFT. If the Lagrangian algebras in the SymTFT are known, this provides a method to compute algebras in all fusion categories that share the same SymTFT. We find necessary conditions that a line operator in the SymTFT must satisfy for the corresponding line operator in the 1+1D QFT to be non-anomalous. We use this constraint to show that a non-invertible symmetry admits a 1+1D trivially gapped phase if and only if the SymTFT admits a magnetic Lagrangian algebra. We define a process of transporting non-anomalous line operators between fusion categories which share the same SymTFT and apply this method to the three Haagerup fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of surface electron spectrum and cyclotron motion in the CDW phase of Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) instability drastically affects the surface electron spectrum of a Weyl semimetal. We show that in the CDW phase, the Fermi arcs reconnect into either closed Fermi loops or Frieze patterns traversing the reconstructed surface mini-Brillouin zone. For the closed reconnection topology, the application of an out-of-plane magnetic field leads to a cyclotron motion of the surface electrons. We determine the cyclotron frequency as a function of the electron energy and the magnitude of the CDW gap $\Delta$ for various orientations of the Fermi arcs. For weak coupling, the period of cyclotron motion is dominated by the time of traversal of the arc reconnection regions and is inversely proportional to $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional higher-order saddle points induced flat bands in Co-based kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The saddle point (van Hove singularity) exhibits a divergent density of states in 2D systems, leading to fascinating phenomena like strong correlations and unconventional superconductivity, yet it is seldom observed in 3D systems. In this work, we have found two types of 3D higher-order saddle points (HOSPs) in emerging 3D kagome metals, YbCo$_6$Ge$_6$ and MgCo$_6$Ge$_6$. Both HOSPs exhibit a singularity in their density of states, which is significantly enhanced compared to the ordinary saddle point. The HOSP near the Fermi energy generates a flat band extending a large area in the Brillouin zone, potentially amplifying the correlation effect and fostering electronic instabilities. Two types of HOSPs exhibit distinct robustness upon element substitution and lattice distortions in these kagome compounds. Our work paves the way for engineering exotic band structures, such as saddle points and flat bands, and exploring interesting phenomena in Co-based kagome materials.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity quantum materials combine the rich many-body physics of condensed matter systems with strong coupling to the surrounding electromagnetic field, which presents both novel prospects and intricate challenges. One is often interested in the properties of one specific aspect of the material, e.g. the electronic many-body dynamics, subject to a structured bath of phononic and photonic modes. Open quantum systems featuring non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) but their usage of the system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to reach a consistent and rigorous description of open many-body systems and their quantum dynamics. We demonstrate first the strength and limitations of this stacked hierarchy for superradiant emission and spin-squeezing of established quantum optical models before presenting its full potential for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we explicitly simulate the impact of charge noise on the dynamic of the Fermi-Hubbard model subject to a structured bath comprising cavity and vibro-phononic environment. Strong optical coupling not only modifies the dynamic of the many-body system but serves furthermore as measurement channel providing information about the correlated motion imprinted by charge noise. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice-coupled helical magnetic order in breathing pyrochlore magnets, CuAlCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ and CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report low-temperature powder X-ray and neutron diffraction studies on breathing pyrochlore magnets Cu$M$Cr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ ($M$ = Al, Ga), which undergo a magnetic transition at $T_{\rm N} \approx$ 21 and 31 K for {$M$ = Al and Ga, respectively. X-ray diffraction reveals that the magnetic transition accompanies a structural transition from cubic $F{\overline 4}3m$ to polar orthorhombic $Imm2$ symmetry for both the compounds, with larger distortion observed for $M$ = Ga at low temperatures. Neutron diffraction reveals incommensurate magnetic modulation ${\mathbf Q} = (q_{\rm IC}, 0.5, 0)$ in the orthorhombic setting, where $q_{\rm IC} \approx$ 0.39 and 0.31 for $M$ = Al and Ga, respectively. Our magnetic-structure analysis suggests cycloid-type magnetic order but not proper-screw type for both the compounds. We find strong correlation between the local spin configuration and Cr-Cr bond lengths, indicating that the spin-lattice coupling as well as the magnetic frustration play an important role in determining the ground state. Cu$M$Cr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ potentially offers a platform to explore magnetoelectric effects arising from the helimagnet driven electric polarity.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, plays a central role in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). The generators of such symmetries have a close connection to non-abelian anyonic objects in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we revisit the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra "bulk semionization" which corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs. This is a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and can be interpreted as a version of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography has been expected to be applicable to the systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chains and arrays of phosphorus donors in silicon have recently been used to demonstrate dopant-based quantum simulators. The dopant disorder present in fabricated devices must be accounted for. Here, we theoretically study transport through disordered donor-based $3\times 3$ arrays that model recent experimental results. We employ a theory that combines the exact diagonalization of an extended Hubbard model of the array with a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism to model transport in interacting systems. We show that current flow through the array and features of measured stability diagrams are highly resilient to disorder. We interpret this as an emergence of uncomplicated behavior in the multi-electron system dominated by strong correlations, regardless of array filling, where the current follows the shortest paths between source and drain sites that avoid possible obstacles. The reference $3\times 3$ array has transport properties very similar to three parallel 3-site chains coupled only by interchain Coulomb interaction, which indicates a challenge in characterizing such devices.</description>

      <title>Raman-phonon-polariton condensation in a transversely pumped cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons are hybrid states of light and matter that are typically realised when optically active phonons couple strongly to photons. We suggest a new approach to realising phonon polaritons, by employing a transverse-pumping Raman scheme, as used in experiments on cold atoms in optical cavities. This approach allows hybridisation between an optical cavity mode and any Raman-active phonon mode. Moreover, this approach enables one to tune the effective phonon-photon coupling by changing the strength of the transverse pumping light. We show that such a system may realise a phonon-polariton condensate. To do this, we find the stationary states and use Floquet theory to determine their stability. We thus identify distinct superradiant and lasing states in which the polariton modes are macroscopically populated. We map out the phase diagram of these states as a function of pump frequencies and strengths. Using parameters for transition metal dichalcogenides, we show that realisation of these phases may be practicably obtainable. The ability to manipulate phonon mode frequencies and attain steady-state populations of selected phonon modes provides a new tool for engineering correlated states of electrons.</description>

      <title>Chiral Pseudo Spin Liquids in Moire Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose multi-layer moire structures in strong external magnetic fields as a novel platform for realizing highly-tunable, frustrated Hubbard physics with topological order. Identifying the layer degree of freedom as a pseudo spin, allows us to retain SU(2) symmetry while controlling ring-exchange processes and concurrently quenching the kinetic energy by large external magnetic fields. This way, a broad class of interacting Hubbard-Hofstadter states and their transitions can be studied. Remarkably, in the limit of strong interactions the system becomes Mott insulating and we find chiral pseudo spin liquid phases which are induced by the magnetic field. We find that this topologically ordered state remains exceptionally stable towards relevant perturbations. We discuss how layer pseudo-spin can be probed in near-term experiments. As the magnetic flux can be easily tuned in moire systems, our approach provides a promising route towards the experimental realization and control of topologically ordered phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: We aim to address the following question: if we start with a quantum state with a spontaneously broken higher-form symmetry, what is the fate of the system under weak local quantum measurements? We demonstrate that under certain conditions, a phase transition can be driven by weak measurements, which suppresses the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry and weakens the 1-form symmetry charge fluctuation. We analyze the nature of the transitions employing the tool of duality, and we demonstrate that some of the transitions driven by weak measurement enjoy a line of fixed points with self-duality.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity in single-layer graphene has attracted considerable interest. Here, using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we study transitions of superconductivity and magnetism in a graphene monolayer with a special periodic strain. Consistent with experiments, the deformation accumulates a series of flat bands, whose robustness under interaction is verified through electron localization in real space. During the reconstruction of the band structure, the superconductivity appears in flat band range with next-nearest neighbor d+id pairing symmetry dominating other modes and is accompanied by ferromagnetism caused by symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate that the strain-induced symmetry breaking would accumulate an energy-gap antiferromagnetic insulating phase at half filling even under the limitation of not strong enough interaction, which shows its potential as a platform that exhibits strongly correlated phenomena.</description>

Abstract: A quantum coherent screening cloud around a magnetic impurity in metallic systems is the hallmark of the antiferromagnetic Kondo effect. Despite the central role of the Kondo effect in quantum materials, the structure of quantum correlations of the screening cloud has defied direct observations. In this work, we introduce a machine-learning algorithm that allows to spatially map the entangled electronic modes in the vicinity of the impurity site from experimentally accessible data. We demonstrate that local correlators allow reconstructing the local many-body correlation entropy in real-space in a double Kondo system with overlapping entanglement clouds. Our machine learning methodology allows bypassing the typical requirement of measuring long-range non-local correlators with conventional methods. We show that our machine learning algorithm is transferable between different Kondo system sizes, and we show its robustness in the presence of noisy correlators. Our work establishes the potential of machine learning methods to map many-body entanglement from real-space measurements.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of Disorder Driven Electronic Liquid Crystal Phases in Dirac Nodal Line Semimetal GdSbTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic liquid crystal (ELC) phases are spontaneous symmetry breaking states believed to arise from strong electron correlation in quantum materials such as cuprates and iron pnictides. Here, we report a direct observation of ELC phases in a Dirac nodal line (DNL) semimetal GdSbxTe2-x. Electronic nanostructures consisting of incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local nematic order are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As topological materials with symmetry protected Dirac or Weyl fermions are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such ELC phases are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave - orthorhombic structural transition. We further show how dopants can induce nematicity via quasiparticle scattering interference. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, topology and electron correlation.</description>

      <title>Disordered non-Fermi liquid fixed point for two-dimensional metals at Ising-nematic quantum critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of quenched random potential is crucial for comprehending the exotic electronic transport of non-Fermi liquid metals near metallic quantum critical points. In this study, we identify a stable fixed point governing the quantum critical behavior of two-dimensional non-Fermi liquid metals in the presence of a random potential disorder. By performing renormalization group analysis on a dimensional-regularized field theory for Ising-nematic quantum critical points, we systematically investigate the interplay between random potential disorder for electrons and Yukawa-type interactions between electrons and bosonic order-parameter fluctuations in a perturbative epsilon expansion. At the one-loop order, the effective field theory lacks stable fixed points, instead exhibiting a runaway flow toward infinite disorder strength. However, at the two-loop order, the effective field theory converges to a stable fixed point characterized by finite disorder strength, termed the "disordered non-Fermi liquid (DNFL) fixed point." Our investigation reveals that two-loop vertex corrections induced by Yukawa couplings are pivotal in the emergence of the DNFL fixed point, primarily through screening disorder scattering. Additionally, the DNFL fixed point is distinguished by a substantial anomalous scaling dimension of fermion fields, resulting in pseudogap-like behavior in the electron's density of states. These findings shed light on the quantum critical behavior of disordered non-Fermi liquid metals, emphasizing the indispensable role of higher-order loop corrections in such comprehension.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider the derivation of Ward identities for spin stiffnesses, which determine the non-linear sigma model of magnetic degrees of freedom of interacting electrons in the presence of antiferromagnetic or incommensurate correlations. We emphasize that in the approaches, which do not break explicitly spin symmetry of the action, the spatial components of gauge kernel, which is used to obtain spin stiffnesses, remain gauge invariant even in case of spontaneous spin symmetry breaking. We derive the corrected Ward identities, which account for this gauge invariance. We emphasize that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffnesses is not fixed by the obtained identities, and show that the infinitesimally small external staggered field is crucially important to obtain finite static uniform transverse susceptibility. On the other hand, we find that the spatial spin stiffnesses are determined by the gauge kernel of the Legendre transformed theory, which is in general {\it different} from the gauge kernel of the original theory and obtain an explicit expressions for spatial spin stiffnesses through susceptibilities and current correlation functions. We verify numerically the obtained results within dynamic mean field theory, and obtain doping dependencies of the resulting spin stiffnesses for antiferromagnetic and incommensurate phase.</description>

Abstract: Topological semimetals, such as the Weyl and Dirac semimetals, represent one of the most active research fields in modern condensed matter physics. The peculiar physical properties of these systems mainly originate from their underlying symmetries, emergent relativistic dispersion, and band topology. In this Letter, we present a different class of gapless systems in three dimensions, dubbed $\textit{geometric semimetals}$. These semimetals are protected by the generalized chiral and rotation symmetries, but are topologically trivial. Nevertheless, we show that their band geometry is nontrivial, as evidenced by the nonzero quantum metric trace with possible quantization. The possible realization in synthetic-matter experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal structure of measurement-induced information in many-body ground states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike unitary dynamics, measurements of a subsystem can induce long-range entanglement via quantum teleportation. The amount of measurement-induced entanglement or mutual information depends jointly on the measurement basis and the entanglement structure of the state (before measurement), and has operational significance for whether the state is a resource for measurement-based quantum computing, as well as for the computational complexity of simulating the state using quantum or classical computers. In this work, we examine entropic measures of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) and information (MII) for the ground-states of quantum many-body systems in one- and two- spatial dimensions. From numerical and analytic analysis of a variety of models encompassing critical points, quantum Hall states, string-net topological orders, and Fermi liquids, we identify universal features of the long-distance structure of MIE and MII that depend only on the underlying phase or critical universality class of the state. We argue that, whereas in $1d$ the leading contributions to long-range MIE and MII are universal, in $2d$, the existence of a teleportation transition for finite-depth circuits implies that trivial $2d$ states can exhibit long-range MIE, and the universal features lie in sub-leading corrections. We introduce modified MIE measures that directly extract these universal contributions. As a corollary, we show that the leading contributions to strange-correlators, used to numerically identify topological phases, are in fact non-universal in two or more dimensions, and explain how our modified constructions enable one to isolate universal components. We discuss the implications of these results for classical- and quantum- computational simulation of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the critical temperature and disorder in holographic superconductors on superfluid density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments strongly indicate deep connections between transports of strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors. For example, the dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature is generally linear, which is incompatible with the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description. We develop an analytical method for AC conductivity calculation and explore the scaling relations among superconducting critical temperature, superfluid density, and momentum dissipation strength for the Gubser-Rocha model with extensions in the probe limit. In the normal phase, we show that the critical temperature is proportional to the momentum dissipation strength in a certain parameter range, which is universal in holographic models. In the superconducting phase, studying the AC conductivity analytically and numerically, we find linear dependence of zero-temperature superfluid density (phase stiffness) on the critical superconducting temperature, which is consistent with recent experiments of high $T_c$ superconductors. These results further underpin the deep connections between strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Exotic Superfluid with Emergent flux in a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a novel chiral superfluid (CSF) phase in a chain of Bose-Fermi mixture, which has been validated using two unbiased numerical methods, density matrix renormalization group and Grassmann multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz. The system hosts the interplay between two types of fermions: bare spinless fermions and composite fermions, the latter consisting of a fermion and a boson. In the CSF phase, bosons condensate at non-zero momentum $\pm 2\pi /L$ with chain length $L$. In essence, the local superfluid order parameter continuously rotates along the chain, indicating that the CSF phase spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. This symmetry breaking gives rise to an emergent flux in the background, effectively optimizing the kinetic energy of the composite fermions within the system. We provide a physical understanding at the mean-field level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 1D CSF phase can emerge in a more widely applicable extended Hubbard model. The potential realization of this phase in cold-atom experiments has also been explored.</description>

      <title>Revealing the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sublattice symmetry on a bipartite lattice is commonly regarded as the chiral symmetry in the AIII class of the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer classification. Here, we reveal the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry, and show that this assertion holds only if the periodicity of primitive unit cells agrees with that of the sublattice labeling. In cases where the periodicity does not agree, sublattice symmetry is represented as a glide reflection in energy-momentum space, which inverts energy and simultaneously translates some $k$ by $\pi$, leading to substantially different physics. Particularly, it introduces novel constraints on zero modes in semimetals and completely alters the classification table of topological insulators compared to class AIII. Notably, the dimensions corresponding to trivial and nontrivial classifications are switched, and the nontrivial classification becomes $\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$. We have applied these results to several models, including the Hofstadter model both with and without dimerization.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal order parameter of pair superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the normal superfluid phase.</description>
