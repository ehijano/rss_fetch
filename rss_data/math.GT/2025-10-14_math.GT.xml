      <title>On the Mather stability theorem for smooth maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [MaII] Mather proved that a smooth proper infinitesimally stable map is stable. This result is the key component of the Mather stability theorem [MaV], which can be reformulated as follows: a smooth proper map $f: M\to N$ is stable if and only if it is infinitesimally stable if and only if it satisfies the Mather normal crossing condition. The latter condition, roughly speaking, means that all map germs of $f$ are stable and $f$ maps the singular strata of $f$ to $N$ in a mutually transversal manner. In this note we adapt a short argument from the book by Golubitsky and Guillemin to derive the Mather stability theorem presented in [MaV] from the theorem in [MaII].</description>

      <title>On the Coarse Lusternik-Schnirelmann Category of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse analog of the classical Lusternik-Schnirelmann category which we denote by $\text{c-cat}$, defined for metric spaces in the coarse homotopy category. This provides a new tool for studying large-scale topological properties of groups and spaces. We establish that $\text{c-cat}$ is a coarse homotopy invariant and prove a lower-bound $\text{p-cat}(\Gamma)\leq \text{c-cat}(\Gamma)$ for geometrically finite groups $\Gamma$, where $\text{p-cat}$ denotes the proper LS-category introduced in 1992 by Ayala and co-authors. We also prove an upper bound $\text{c-cat}(\Gamma) \leq \text{asdim}(\Gamma)$ for bicombable 1-ended groups which are semistable at $\infty$.</description>

      <title>On the integral simplicial volume of cyclic covers of mapping tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the integral simplicial volume of cyclic covers of manifolds that fiber over the circle with fiber given by an $n$-dimensional torus. By studying the integral filling volume -- an invariant introduced by Frigerio and the first author -- for the monodromy, we establish both lower and upper bounds for the limit of the integral simplicial volume of these covers, normalized by the degree of the covering. These bounds are expressed in terms of the action of the monodromy on the real homology of the fiber.
  As applications, we establish a close connection between the topological entropy and the integral filling volume of self-homeomorphisms of $n$-dimensional tori, we find new examples for which the Delta-complexity and the integral simplicial volume are not equivalent, and we prove the nonvanishing of the filling volume for Anosov self-diffeomorphisms of infranilmanifolds.</description>

      <title>Continuous Inverse Ambiguous Functions on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous study, the first author defines an inverse ambiguous function on a group $G$ to be a bijective function $f : G \to G$ satisfying the functional equation $f^{-1}(x) = f(x^{-1})$ for all $x \in G$. In this paper, we investigate the existence of continuous inverse ambiguous functions on classical Lie groups. In particular, we look at tori, elliptic curves over various fields, vector spaces, additive matrix groups, and multiplicative matrix groups.</description>

      <title>An Invitation to Obstruction Bundle Gluing Through Morse Flow Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt "Obstruction Bundle Gluing (OBG)" techniques from Hutchings and Taubes (arxiv: 0701300, 0705.2074) to Morse theory. We consider Morse function-metric pairs with gradient flowlines that have nontrivial yet well-controlled cokernels (i.e., the gradient flowlines are not transversely cut out). We investigate (i) whether these nontransverse gradient flowlines can be glued to other gradient flowlines and (ii) the bifurcation of gradient flowlines after we perturb the metric to be Morse-Smale. For the former, we show that certain three-component broken flowlines with total Fredholm index 2 can be glued to a one-parameter family of flowlines of the given metric if and only if an explicit (essentially combinatorial, and straightforward to verify) criterion is satisfied. For the latter, we provide a similar combinatorial criterion of when certain 2-level broken Morse flowlines of total Fredholm index 1 glue to index 1 gradient flowlines after perturbing the metric. Our primary example is the ``upright torus," which has a flowline between the two index-1 critical points.</description>

      <title>From Morse Functions to Lefschetz Fibrations on Cotangent Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for any Morse function on a compact manifold and any adapted gradient satisfying the Morse-Smale condition, there is a homotopically unique complex-valued symplectic Lefschetz fibration on the cotangent bundle whose restriction to the zero-section is the given function, whose imaginary part is the evaluation of covectors on the gradient, and which is equivariant under the actions of the fiberwise antipodal involution and the complex conjugation. Then we study the topology and symplectic geometry of the regular fibers of this fibration, which are well-defined Weinstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>A proof of Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture for WRT invariants of Seifert fibered homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a general Seifert fibered integral homology $3$-sphere with $r\ge3$ exceptional fibers. For every root of unity $\zeta\not=1$, we show that the SU(2) WRT invariant of $X$ evaluated at $\zeta$ is (up to an elementary factor) the non-tangential limit at $\zeta$ of the GPPV invariant of $X$, thereby generalizing a result from [Andersen-Mistegard 2022]. Based on this result, we apply the quantum modularity results developed in [Han-Li-Sauzin-Sun 2023] to the GPPV invariant of $X$ to prove Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture [Witten 1989] for the WRT invariant of $X$. We also prove that the GPPV invariant of $X$ induces a higher depth strong quantum modular form. Moreover, when suitably normalized, the GPPV invariant provides an ``analytic incarnation'' of the Habiro invariant.</description>

Abstract: We report on recent developments in the dynamics and rigidity of infinite-volume homogeneous spaces, viewed through the lens of circles. By addressing four natural questions about circle packings, we highlight the interplay between dynamics, geometry, and rigidity that defines the emerging frontier of homogeneous dynamics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically large free semigroups in Zariski dense discrete subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected algebraic semisimple real Lie group with finite center and no compact factors, and let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of $G$. We show that $\Gamma$ contains free, finitely generated subsemigroups whose critical exponents are arbitrarily close to that of $\Gamma$. Furthermore, these subsemigroups are Zariski dense in $G$ and $P$-Anosov in the sense of Kassel--Potrie. This shows that no gap phenomenon holds for critical exponents of discrete subsemigroups of Lie groups, which in contrast with Leuzinger's critical exponent gap theorem for infinite covolume discrete subgroups of Lie groups with Kazhdan's property (T), proven in 2003.
  As an important step towards our construction, we introduce and study properties of a particular type of loxodromic element, which we call an $\epsilon$-contracting element, and construct our free subsemigroups in such a way that all of their elements are either $\epsilon$-contracting or $2\epsilon$-contracting. One of the main novelties in this approach is that it enables us to study the action of $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary $G/P$ intrinsically, in the sense that we do not embed $G/P$ into a product of projective spaces associated to the proximal irreducible algebraic Tits representations of $G$.
  This definition is inspired by the notion of $\epsilon$-proximal elements, which plays a prominent role in the seminal works of Abels--Margulis--Soifer on the actions of linear groups on projective spaces and of Benoist on algebraic and asymptotic properties of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups. We hope this perspective will lead to further developments in the study of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups and provide simpler proofs of results currently in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smooth structures on high dimensional manifolds are classified by maps to the infinite loop space $TOP/O$. The homotopy groups of this space are known to be finite. Given a compact Lie group $G$, this space can be regarded as an equivariant infinite loop space and equivariant maps from a locally linear, high dimensional $G$-manifold to $TOP/O$ classify stable $G$-smoothings. We compute the equivariant homotopy groups $\pi_V^{C_p}TOP/O\otimes\Q$ where $C_p$ denotes the cyclic group of order $p$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we provide a local classification of certain special classes of surfaces determined by the prescription of the radial mean curvature in terms of the height and angle functions. Moreover, we introduce a special class of hypersurfaces, and we also provide a local classification of these three-dimensional hypersurfaces whose second mean curvature vanishes. Finally, we present a recursive method for constructing such hypersurfaces, extending the same curvature prescription approach to higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We provide characterizations of Anosov representations of word hyperbolic groups into real semisimple Lie groups in terms of the existence of equivariant limit maps on the Gromov boundary, the Cartan property and the uniform gap summation property introduced by Guichard-Gu\'eritaud-Kassel-Wienhard. We also study representations of finitely generated groups satisfying weak uniform gaps in eigenvalues and establish conditions to be Anosov. As an application, we also obtain a characterization of strongly convex cocompact subgroups of the projective linear group $\mathsf{PGL}_d(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use iterations of skinning maps on Teichm\"uller spaces to study circle packings and develop a renormalization theory for circle packings whose nerves satisfy certain subdivision rules. We characterize when the skinning map has bounded image. Under the corresponding condition, we prove that the renormalization operator $\mathfrak{R}$ is uniformly contracting. This allows us to give complete answers for the existence and moduli problems for such circle packings. The exponential contraction of $\mathfrak{R}^n$ means that despite the non-rigidity of such circle packings, they are geometrically inflexible. As an application, we show that any geometrically finite Kleinian circle packing is combinatorially rigid.</description>

Abstract: We show that pseudo-Anosov mapping classes are generic in every Cayley graph of the mapping class group of a finite-type hyperbolic surface. Our method also yields an analogous result for rank-one CAT(0) groups and hierarchically hyperbolic groups with Morse elements. Finally, we prove that Morse elements are generic in every Cayley graph of groups that are quasi-isometric to (well-behaved) hierarchically hyperbolic groups. This gives a quasi-isometry invariant theory of counting group elements in groups beyond relatively hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Koszul dual $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ algebras for star-shaped diagrams -- Part 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By slicing the Heegaard diagram for a given $3$-manifold in a particular way, it is possible to construct $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$-bimodules, the tensor product of which retrieves the Heegaard Floer homology of the original 3-manifold. The first step in this is to construct algebras corresponding to the individual slices. Here, we use the graphical calculus for $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$-structures introduced by Lipshitz, Ozsv\'ath, and Thurston, to construct Koszul dual weighted $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, and dualizing bimodules for a particular star-shaped class of slice. The duality result is then proved in the sequel.</description>

      <title>On integral rigidity in Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to prove integral rigidity results for the Seiberg-Witten invariants of a closed $4$-manifold $X$ containing a non-separating hypersurface $Y$ satisfying suitable (chain-level) Floer theoretic conditions. As a concrete application, we show that if $X$ has the homology of a four-torus, and it contains a non-separating three-torus, then the sum of all Seiberg-Witten invariants of $X$ is determined in purely cohomological terms. Our results can be interpreted as $(3+1)$-dimensional versions of Donaldson's TQFT approach to the formula of Meng-Taubes, and build upon a subtle interplay between irreducible solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations on $X$ and reducible ones on $Y$ and its complement. Along the way, we provide a concrete description of the associated graded map (for a suitable filtration) of the map on $\overline{HM}_*$ induced by a negative cobordism between three-manifolds, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The non-simply connected Price twist for the 4-sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cutting and pasting operation on a $P^2$-knot $S$ in a $4$-manifold is called the Price twist. The Price twist for the $4$-sphere $S^4$ yields at most three $4$-manifolds up to diffeomorphism, namely, the $4$-sphere $S^4$, the other homotopy $4$-sphere $\Sigma_{S}(S^4)$ and a non-simply connected $4$-manifold $\tau_{S}(S^4)$. In this paper, we study some properties and diffeomorphism types of $\tau_{S}(S^4)$ for $P^2$-knots $S$ of Kinoshita type.</description>

      <title>Topology and Algebra of Bonded Knots and Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a detailed study of \emph{bonded knots} and their related structures, integrating recent developments into a single framework. Bonded knots are classical knots endowed with embedded bonding arcs modeling physical or chemical bonds. We consider bonded knots in three categories (long, standard, and tight) according to the type of bonds, and in two categories, topological vertex and rigid vertex, according to the allowed isotopy moves, and we define invariants for each category. We then develop the theory of \emph{bonded braids}, the algebraic counterpart of bonded knots. We define the {\it bonded braid monoid}, with its generators and relations, and formulate the analogues of the Alexander and Markov theorems for bonded braids, including an $L$-equivalence for bonded braids. Next, we introduce \emph{enhanced bonded knots and braids}, incorporating two types of bonds (attracting and repelling) corresponding to different interactions. We define the enhanced bonded braid group and show how the bonded braid monoid embeds into this group. Finally, we study \emph{bonded knotoids}, which are open knot diagrams with bonds, and their closure operations, and we define the \emph{bonded closure}. We introduce \emph{bonded braidoids} as the algebraic counterpart of bonded knotoids. These models capture the topology of open chains with inter and intra-chain bonds and suggest new invariants for classifying biological macromolecules.</description>

      <title>Knot Floer Homology, the Burau Representation, and Quantum $\mathfrak{gl}(1 \vert 1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Burau representation of braid groups and knot Floer homology share a link to the Fox calculus. We make this connection explicit, with the following outcome: if $B$ is the full Burau matrix of any braid, and $A$ is any square submatrix of $B - \lambda I$, we define a Heegaard Floer homology theory that categorifies $\det(A)$ and is an invariant of the braid. We also describe an analogous construction for the Gassner representation. Then, we leverage the relationship between the Burau representation and quantum $\mathfrak{gl}(1 \vert 1)$ to exhibit connections between the latter and Heegaard Floer homology. We associate a bordered sutured Heegaard Floer homology group to any tangle, and give a simple, geometric proof that our invariant recovers the $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(1 \vert 1))$ braid representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any positive integer $n$, Lov\'{a}sz-Schrijver, Taniyama and Skopenkov provided examples of simplicial $n$-complexes that inevitably contain a nonsplittable two-component link of $n$-spheres, no matter how they are embedded into the Euclidean $(2n+1)$-space. In this paper, we introduce a new example of such a simplicial $n$-complex through a simple argument in piecewise linear topology and an application of the van Kampen--Flores theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of additional such complexes through higher dimensional generalizations of the $\triangle Y$-exchange on graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study toroidal compactifications of finite volume complex hyperbolic manifolds. We obtain results on the existence or nonexistence of K\"ahler metrics satisfying certain nonpositive curvature properties on these compactifications. Starting from quotients of complex hyperbolic space by deep enough non-uniform arithmetic lattices, we also verify the Shafarevich conjecture for their compactifications, by showing that their universal covers are Stein.</description>

      <title>Fine shape of metrizable spaces as a left fraction localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong shape category of compact metrizable spaces (compacta) is very well-studied; extending it to noncompact spaces, however, introduces computational complexity that makes it hard to work with. The fine shape category, as defined by Melikhov, seems to hold promise in terms of both applicability and simplicity: it is a different extension of compact strong shape to a generalized homotopy theory of metrizable spaces that is compatible with both \v{C}ech cohomology and Steenrod-Sitnikov homology, and its definition lends itself to straightforward proofs. Further research seems to be in order. One goal to have in mind is to show the fine shape category to be a homotopy category in Quillen's sense, which implies representation as a localization. But the strong shape of compacta was shown to be a left fraction localization in several ways; we extend the representation given by Cathey to fine shape, introducing the notion of FDR-embeddings to extend Cathey's SSDR-maps. In the process, we also introduce what we call the mapping cylinder of an approaching map; such a construction has been defined by Ferry and elaborated on by Mrozik in the compact case, yet it seems the direct extension on noncompact spaces is not possible. Thus we resort to a somewhat different definition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g'}\to \Sigma_g$ be a cover of an orientable surface of genus g by an orientable surface of genus g', branched at n points, with Galois group H. Such a cover induces a virtual action of the mapping class group $\text{Mod}_{g,n+1}$ of a genus g surface with n+1 marked points on $H^1(\Sigma_{g'}, \mathbb{C})$. When g is large in terms of the group H, we calculate precisely the connected monodromy group of this action. The methods are Hodge-theoretic and rely on a "generic Torelli theorem with coefficients."</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a subclass of overtwisted contact structures, called strongly overtwisted, on a 3-manifold that satisfy a complete h-principle without prescribing the contact structures over any subset of the 3-manifold. As a consequence, the homotopy type of the space of overtwisted disk embeddings into a strongly overtwisted contact 3-manifold is determined. A complete h-principle for a subclass of loose Legendrians is also derived from the main result. In general, the method allows us to deduce an h-principle for overtwisted disks that are fixed near the boundary in an arbitrary overtwisted contact 3-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We count the number of connected components in the space of triples of transverse flags in any flag manifold of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and deduce that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit algorithm based on computation of minors to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{&gt;0}$ when $p\neq q$.</description>
