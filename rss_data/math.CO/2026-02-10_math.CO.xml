      <title>Factorizations of Matrices With Recursive Entries and Related Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines matrices whose entries are determined by recursive relations of the form $A_{i, j} = x A_{i, j-1} + y A_{i-1, j-1} + z A_{i-1, j}$, where $x, y, z$ are constants, and the initial conditions are defined along the first row and column. We present a general decomposition for such matrices and show that many of the known decompositions are particular cases of this more general decomposition. Additionally, we provide a decomposition of these matrices into Pascal-like matrices and a basic Toeplitz matrix.</description>

      <title>On 3-colorability of (claw, diamond)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $3$-colorability problem is a well-known NP-complete problem and it remains NP-complete for $(claw, diamond, K_4)$-free graphs. Recently, $3$-colorability has been also considered for $(claw, N_{1,1,1})$-free graphs. Here, a generalised net $N_{i, j, k}$ is the graph obtained by identifying each vertex of a triangle with an endvertex of one of three vetex-disjont paths of lengths $i, j, k$.
  We study the class of $(claw, diamond, N_{i, j, k})$-free graphs for $(i, j, k) \in \{(1, 1, 3),$ $ (1, 2, 2), $ $(2, 2, 2) \}$. We show that these graphs are $3$-colorable or contain a $K_4$ or belong to some well-defined class of non $3$-colorable graphs. Moreover, we prove that there are only finitely many non $3$-colorable $N_{1, 2, k}$-free graphs for any $k \geq 2$, but there exist infinitely many non $3$-colorable $N_{i, j, k}$-free graphs for any
  $2 \leq i \leq j \leq k.$</description>

      <title>Extremal Graphs for the Lights Out Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lights Out is a game played on a graph $G$ where every vertex has a light bulb that is either on or off, and pressing a vertex $v$ toggles the state of every vertex in the closed neighborhood of $v$. The goal is to find a subset of vertices $S$ such that pressing every vertex in $S$ results in all light bulbs being turned off. We study the extremal graphs for which pressing every vertex is the unique solution to the lights out problem given an initial configuration of all lights on. We show that a graph is extremal if and only if it is even and has an odd number of matchings. Furthermore, there is a bijection between the set of labeled $n$-vertex extremal graphs and the set of symmetric invertible matrices of size $n-2$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$. We prove that any even graph with no cycle of length $0\pmod 3$ must be extremal. We also demonstrate operations that build larger extremal graphs from smaller ones. Along the way, we prove using the polynomial method that in any even graph, the number of matchings of a fixed size covering an odd subset of vertices is even.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetric matrix $M=(m_{ij}) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is said to be associated with an $n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set $\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ if, for every $i \neq j$, we have $m_{ij} \neq 0$ if and only if $\{v_i,v_j\}\in E$. We prove that, for every cograph $G$, there is a matrix $M$ associated with $G$ for which the number of distinct eigenvalues is at most 4.</description>

      <title>On non-planar, cycle-conformal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called matching covered if all of its edges are contained in some perfect matching of $G$. Furthermore, a cycle $C \subseteq G$ is called conformal if $G - V(C)$ has a perfect matching and $G$ itself is called cycle-conformal if all of its even cycles are conformal. Both matching covered graphs and conformal cycles play central roles in matching theory.
  After a string of results from various authors, focused mainly on bipartite, planar graphs and claw-free graphs, a complete characterisation of all planar, cycle-conformal graphs has recently been presented by Dalwadi, Pause, Diwan, and Kothari [DMTCS, 2025]. We continue this exploration further into the realm of non-planar graphs, giving a characterisation of matching covered, cycle-conformal graphs that are bipartite and cubic, and respectively, those that are bipartite and Pfaffian. The last class plays a fundamental role in matching theory, having important connections to the problem of counting perfect matchings, recognising graphs with even directed cycles, and computing the permanent of certain matrices efficiently.
  To prove our results, we break matching covered graphs down to their building blocks, the bipartite ones of which are called braces. The key to both characterisations are theorems that identify the braces in the respective classes. In particular, as our main results, we show that the cycle of length 4 is the only Pfaffian, cycle-conformal brace and we show that $K_{3,3}$ is the only cubic, cycle-conformal brace. In both cases these theorems facilitate the characterisations of the much richer classes of associated matching covered graphs. We conjecture that for each integer $\ell \geq 2$ the only $\ell$-regular, cycle-conformal brace is $K_{\ell,\ell}$.</description>

      <title>Maximally probable tree topologies with $r$-furcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a specific rooted labeled tree topology, a labeled history is a sequence of branchings that give rise to that labeled topology as it unfolds over time. Here, for $r$-furcating trees, we use a connection with Huffman trees from information theory to identify maximally probable rooted trees -- unlabeled $r$-furcating topologies whose labelings each have a number of labeled histories greater than or equal to those of all other labeled topologies. Our characterization of the unique maximally probable $r$-furcating unlabeled topology generalizes the Harding--Hammersley--Grimmett result identifying the maximally probable bifurcating unlabeled topology, and it provides a new proof for that result. We present a conjecture for the maximally probable $r$-furcating unlabeled topology if labeled histories are tabulated allowing for simultaneous branching events across multiple internal nodes of a tree.</description>

      <title>Cops and robber in graphs with bounded vertex cover number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meyniel's conjecture states that $n$-vertex connected graphs have cop number $O(\sqrt{n})$. The current best known upper bound is $n/2^{(1-o(1))\sqrt{\log n}}$, proved independently by Lu and Peng (2011), and by Scott and Sudakov (2011). In this paper, we extend their result by showing that every connected graph with vertex cover number $k$ has cop number at most $k/2^{(1-o(1))\sqrt{\log k}}$. This is the first sublinear upper bound on the cop number in terms of the vertex cover number.</description>

      <title>The Tur\'an number of the triangular pyramid of 4-layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tur\'{a}n number $ex(n,H)$ of a graph $H$ is the maximum number of edges in any $H$-free graph on $n$ vertices. The triangular pyramid of $k$-layers, denoted by $TP_k$, is a generalization of a triangle. The Tur\'an problems of a triangular pyramid with small layers have been studied widely by Liu (E-JC, 2013), Xiao, Katona, Xiao and Zamora (DAM, 2022), Ghosh, Gy\H{o}ri, Paulos, Xiao and Zamora (DAM, 2022). Moreover, Ghosh et al. conjectured that $ex(n, TP_4)=\frac{1}{4}n^2+\Theta(n^{\frac{4}{3}})$. In this note, we confirm this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Certain topological indices and spectral properties of SGB-graphs of finite cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L(G)$ be the set of all subgroups of a group $G$. The subgroup generating bipartite graph $\mathcal{B}(G)$ defined on $G$ is a bipartite graph whose vertex set is the union of two sets $G \times G$ and $L(G)$, and two vertices $(a, b) \in G \times G$ and $H \in L(G)$ are adjacent if $H$ is generated by $a$ and $b$. In this paper, we realize the structures of $\mathcal{B}(G)$ for cyclic groups of order $pq, p^2q$ and $p^2q^2$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes and $p \neq q$. We also deduce expressions for first and second Zagreb indices of these graphs and check the validity of Hansen-Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture [Hansen, P. and Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c}, D. Comparing the Zagreb indices, {\em Croatica Chemica Acta}, \textbf{80}(2), 165-168, 2007]. Expressions of certain other degree-based topological indices of these graphs are also computed. We further compute various spectra and their corresponding energies of $\mathcal{B}(G)$ if $G$ is any cyclic group of order $p^n, pq, p^2q$ and $p^2q^2$, where $p$ and $q$ are two distinct primes and $n \geq 1$. We conclude the paper showing that $\mathcal{B}(G)$ satisfies E-LE conjecture [Gutman, I., Abreu, N. M. M., Vinagre, C. T. M., Bonifacioa, A. S. and Radenkovic, S. Relation between energy and Laplacian energy, {\em MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry}, \textbf{59}, 343--354, 2008] for these groups.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Limit Formulas and Stable-Range Rigidity for Cyclotomic Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study truncation compatible families F = (F_m)_{m&gt;=1} over Q[z] through an inverse limit formalism, and we evaluate them at the punctured cyclotomic cosine points alpha_{k,n} = cos(2 pi k/n) with the specialization z equals n-1. For symmetric families of uniformly bounded total degree in x &lt;= d, we prove a stable range rigidity theorem: for all n &gt;= d+2, the cosine point evaluation factors through the finitely many punctured cosine power sums the finitely many power sums P1(n) through Pd(n). In the purely polynomial case this implies eventual polynomiality in n. We then extend the framework to include fixed product factors and package their cosine point contribution in multiplicative invariants MQ(n). In the stable range, the bounded degree symmetric part collapses as before; any remaining cyclotomic dependence occurs only through these explicit product terms. Finally, we show that coefficient extraction from such products produces further bounded degree symmetric families, and we apply this to complete symmetric functions h_r evaluated at cosine points.</description>

      <title>Efficient $k$-Sign Consistency Verification of Hankel Matrices via Schur Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of certifying (strict) $k$-sign consistency of a matrix, that is, whether all of its $k$-th order minors share the same (strict) sign. Although this problem is generally of combinatorial complexity, we show that for Hankel matrices it can be significantly simplified: our sufficient condition requires checking only the $k$-th order minors of a reshaped Hankel matrix with $k$ rows. Remarkably, when applied to the Hankel operator, this sufficient condition is also necessary. Comparable results were known only in the setting of (strictly) $k$-positive Hankel matrices and operators, in which all minors of order up to $k$ have the same (strict) sign.
  More concretely, we derive a formula expressing the $k$-th order minors of Hankel matrices as nonnegative integer linear combinations of $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our derivation uses Schur polynomial theory to show that the $k$-th order minors of any matrix are nonnegative integer linear combinations of row-consecutive $k$-th order minors, meaning minors formed from distinct columns whose consecutive row indices need not coincide across columns. For Hankel matrices, these minors coincide -- up to sign changes arising from column swaps -- with the usual $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our main result then follows by showing that the sum of certain signed nonnegative integer coefficients equals the corresponding Littlewood--Richardson coefficients. In our problem, the nonnegativity of these coefficients ensures that negatively signed column permutations are cancelled by positively signed ones. Our results also extend naturally to Toeplitz matrices and operators, and we present a partial analogue for circulant matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is odd if all of its vertices have odd degrees. In particular, an odd spanning tree in a connected graph is a spanning tree in which all vertices have odd degrees. In this paper we establish a unified technique to enumerate odd spanning trees of a graph $G$ in terms of a multivariable polynomial associated with $G$ and indeterminates $\{x_{i}:v_i\in V(G)\}$. As applications, the enumerative formulas for odd spanning trees in complete graphs, complete multipartite graphs, almost complete graphs, complete split graphs and Ferrers graphs are, respectively, derived from our work.</description>

      <title>Nearly tight bound for rainbow clique subdivisions in properly edge-colored graphs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph is said to be rainbow if all its edges have distinct colors. In this paper, we study the rainbow analogue of a fundamental result of Mader [\emph{Math. Ann.} \textbf{174} (1967), 265--268] on the existence of subdivisions in graphs with large average degree. This is part of the study of rainbow analogues of classical Tur\'an problems, a framework systematically introduced by Keevash, Mubayi, Sudakov and Verstra\"ete [\emph{Combin. Probab. Comput.} \textbf{16} (2007), 109--126]. We prove that every properly edge-colored graph on $n$ vertices with average degree at least $t^2(\log n)^{1+o(1)}$ contains a rainbow subdivision of $K_t$. When $t$ is a constant, this bound is tight up to the $o(1)$ term. So it essentially resolves a question raised by Jiang, Methuku and Yepremyan [\emph{European J. Combin.} \textbf{110} (2023), 103675] on rainbow clique subdivisions, and also implies a result of Alon, Buci\'c, Sauermann, Zakharov and Zamir [\emph{Proc. Lond. Math. Soc.} \textbf{130} (2025), e70044] on rainbow cycles. In addition, we present several applications of our result to problems in additive combinatorics, number theory and coding theory.</description>

      <title>Algebraic degree of Cayley colour graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The splitting field of a graph $\Gamma$ with respect to a square matrix $M$ associated with $\Gamma$, is the smallest field extension over the field of rationals $\mathbb{Q}$ that contains all the eigenvalues of $M$. The degree of the extension is called the algebraic degree of $\Gamma$ with respect to $M$. In this paper, we completely determine the splitting field of the adjacency matrix of the Cayley colour graph $\operatorname{Cay}(G,f)$ on a finite group $G$, associated with a class function $f:G\to\mathbb{Q}$ and compute its algebraic degree, which generalize the main results of Wu et al. Moreover, we study the relation between the algebraic integrality of two Cayley colour graphs, and deduce the fact that the algebraic degree and distance algebraic degree of a normal Cayley graph are same, generalizing a result of Zhang et al.</description>

      <title>Three lectures on tropical algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08664v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document is a slightly expanded version of a series of talks given by J. Giansiracusa at the workshop `Geometry over semirings' at Universitat Aut\`{o}noma de Barcelona in July 2025. In the first lecture we introduce tropical polynomials, ideals, congruences, and how the connection with tropical geometry is made via congruences of bend relations. Tropical geometry and matroid theory are telling us that we should focus attention on a narrow slice of the world of tropical algebra, and this leads to the theory of tropical ideals (as developed by Maclagan and Rinc\'{o}n) and an abundance of interesting open questions. In the second lecture we examine the relationship between Berkovich analytification and tropicalization from the perspective of bend relations, giving a refinement of Payne's influential limit theorem. In the third lecture we set aside geometry and focus on tropicalization via bend relations as a construction in commutative and non-commutative algebra. Constructions such as symmetric algebras, exterior algebras, matrix algebras, and Clifford algebras can be tropicalized. In the case of exterior algebras, the resulting tropical notion beautifully completes the picture of the Pl\"{u}cker embedding and gives a new perspective on the tropical Pl\"{u}cker relations. For matrix algebras and Clifford algebras, Morita theory becomes an interesting topic.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Pair State Transfer on Total Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total graph of a graph $G$, denoted $\mathcal{T}(G)$, is defined as the graph whose vertex set is the union of the vertex set of $G$ and the edge set of $G$ such that two vertices of $\mathcal{T}(G)$ are adjacent if the corresponding elements of $G$ are adjacent or incident. In this paper, we investigate Laplacian perfect pair state transfer and Laplacian pretty good pair state transfer on $\mathcal{T}(G)$, where $G$ is an $r$-regular graph. We prove that if $r&gt;2$ and $r+1$ is not a Laplacian eigenvalue of $G$, then $\mathcal{T}(G)$ fails to exhibit Laplacian perfect pair state transfer. We also prove that if $G$ is a complete graph on more than three vertices, then $\mathcal{T}(G)$ fails to exhibit Laplacian perfect pair state transfer. Further, we prove that under some mild conditions, $\mathcal{T}(G)$ exhibits Laplacian pretty good pair state transfer, where $G$ is an $r$-regular graph such that $r&gt;2$ and $r+1$ is not a Laplacian eigenvalue of $G$. We use these conditions to obtain infinitely many total graphs exhibiting Laplacian pretty good pair state transfer.</description>

Abstract: We construct orientations of rook graphs (whose underlying graphs are claw-free) that contain no directed $C_3$ but have unbounded dichromatic number. This disproves a conjecture of Aboulker, Charbit and Naserasr and improves a result of Carbonero, Koerts, Moore and Spirkl.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism counting for immersion-closed classes is not isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lov\'{a}sz proved that two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if $\hom(K,G) = \hom(K,H)$ for all graphs $K$, where $\hom(G_1,G_2)$ denotes the number of homomorphisms from $G_1$ to $G_2$. Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k showed that it suffices to count homomorphisms from all $2$-degenerate graphs $K$. On the other hand, for several interesting graph classes $\mathcal{M}$, it has been shown that there exist non-isomorphic graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $\hom(K,G)=\hom(K,H)$ for all $K\in \mathcal{M}$. Most such classes are minor-closed classes and Roberson conjectured that every proper minor-closed and union-closed graph class $\mathcal{M}$ has the property of there existing non-isomorphic graphs that are indistinguishable by homomorphism counts from $\mathcal{M}$. There has been an effort to prove Roberson's conjecture as it is believed that minor-closed classes play a special role in the context of homomorphism indistinguishability.
  We show that this special role, if so, must be shared, by proving an analogue of Roberson's conjecture holds for a rich family of non-minor-closed classes. Namely, we prove that for any proper immersion-closed and union-closed class $\mathcal{M}$, there exist non-isomorphic graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $\hom(K,G) = \hom(K,H)$ for all $K \in \mathcal{M}$.
  This extends a result of Roberson on homomorphism indistinguishability over bounded degree graphs, and gives an almost full picture since our result cannot be extended in the natural way, that is, by replacing immersions with topological minors, due to a result of Neuen and Seppelt.</description>

      <title>Total Roman bondage number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A total Roman dominating function (TRDF) on a graph $G$ with no isolated vertices is a function $f:V(G)\to\{0,1,2\}$ such that every vertex $v$ with $f(v)=0$ has a neighbor assigned $2$, and the subgraph induced by $\{v:f(v)&gt;0\}$ has no isolated vertices. The total Roman domination number $\gamma_{tR}(G)$ is the minimum weight of a TRDF on $G$. The total Roman bondage number $b_{tR}(G)$ is the minimum cardinality of an edge set $E'\subseteq E(G)$ such that $G-E'$ has no isolated vertices and $\gamma_{tR}(G-E')&gt;\gamma_{tR}(G)$; if no such $E'$ exists, $b_{tR}(G)=\infty$.
  We prove that deciding whether $b_{tR}(G)\leq k$ is NP-complete for arbitrary graphs. We establish sharp bounds, including $\gamma_{tR}(G)+1\leq \gamma_{tR}(G-B)\leq \gamma_{tR}(G)+2$ for any $b_{tR}(G)$-set $B$ (both sharp), and $b_{tR}(G)\geq \max\{\delta(G),b(G)\}$ when $\gamma_{tR}(G)=3\beta(G)$. We characterize graphs with $b_{tR}(G)=\infty$ and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for $b_{tR}(G)=1$. Exact values are determined for complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, brooms, double brooms, wheels and wounded spiders.
  Further upper bounds are given in terms of order, diameter, girth, and structural features.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly determine all CI-groups with respect to ternary relational structures that have the form $C \times D$, where $C$ is cyclic and $D$ is either a dicyclic group whose order is not divisible by $3$ or a dihedral group. Such groups are also CI-groups with respect to graphs and digraphs.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of a multivariate graph polynomial $\Phi_G(x,y,z)$ that interpolates between classical counting polynomials for matchings and for cycle structures arising in the Harary--Sachs expansion of the characteristic polynomial. We focus on analytic properties and computational consequences. Our main contribution is an explicit, degree-uniform zero-free region for $\Phi_G$ on bounded-degree graphs, obtained via the Fern\'andez--Procacci convergence criterion for abstract polymer gases.</description>

      <title>Unsplittable Transshipments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Unsplittable Transshipment Problem in directed graphs with multiple sources and sinks. An unsplittable transshipment routes given supplies and demands using at most one path for each source-sink pair. Although they are a natural generalization of single source unsplittable flows, unsplittable transshipments raise interesting new challenges and require novel algorithmic techniques. As our main contribution, we give a nontrivial generalization of a seminal result of Dinitz, Garg, and Goemans (1999) by showing how to efficiently turn a given transshipment $x$ into an unsplittable transshipment $y$ with $y_a&lt;x_a+d_{\max}$ for all arcs $a$, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum demand (or supply) value. Further results include bounds on the number of rounds required to satisfy all demands, where each round consists of an unsplittable transshipment that routes a subset of the demands while respecting arc capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>The first 128 digits of an autoconvolution inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using rigorous high-precision floating point arithmetic we compute very tight rigorous bounds on the auto-convolution constant \[
  \nu_2^2 = \inf_f \|f \ast f\|_2^2 = \inf_f \int_{-1}^1 (f \ast f)^2 \] where the infimum is taken over all unit mass functions $f \in L^1(-1/2,1/2)$. This quantity arises in additive combinatorics, particularly in the study of Sidon sets. Our bounds give the first 128 digits of $\nu_2^2$, and so substantially improve previous bounds on this quantity due to White, Green, and Martin &amp; O'Bryant.</description>

      <title>The complexity of pinning simple multiloops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiloop with $s\in \mathbb{N}$ strands is a generic immersion $\gamma\colon \sqcup_1^s \mathbb{S}^1 \looparrowright \Sigma$ of the union of $s$ circles into a surface $\Sigma$, considered up to homeomorphisms. A pinning set of $\gamma$ is a set of points $P\subset \Sigma\setminus \operatorname{im}(\gamma)$, such that in the punctured surface $\Sigma \setminus P$, the immersion $\gamma$ has the minimal number of double points in its homotopy class. Its pinning number $\varpi(\gamma)$ is the minimum cardinal of its pinning sets. In any fixed orientable surface $\Sigma$, the pinning problem which given a multiloop $\gamma$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$ decides whether $\varpi(\gamma)\le k$ has been show to be NP-complete, even in restrictions to loops (with $s=1$ strand). In this work we study the complexity of the pinning problem in restriction to multiloops whose strands are simple (embedded circles). We show that in any fixed oriented surface $\Sigma$, the problem is in P when $s\leq 3$ and NP-complete when $s\geq 20$, and present some follow-up questions and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Unital compressed commuting graph of $3 \times 3$ matrices over a finite prime field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we completely describe the unital compressed commuting graph of the ring $\mathcal{M}_3(\mathrm{GF}(p))$ of $3 \times 3$ matrices over the finite prime field $\mathrm{GF}(p)$. To achieve this we combine methods from linear algebra, field theory, projective geometry and combinatorics. We first partition the set of vertices into types based on the Jordan form and describe the neighborhood of each vertex. The key part of the graph, i.e., the subgraph that corresponds to non-scalar derogatory matrices, is then determined using a bijective correspondence between its vertices and point-line pairs in the projective plane over $\mathrm{GF}(p)$. At the end we explain how the remaining vertices are attached to the key part. We also give an algorithm to construct the whole graph. As a consequence, we describe the usual commuting graph $\Gamma(\mathcal{M}_3(\mathrm{GF}(p)))$, whose structure was an open problem for several years.</description>

      <title>Dynamical sequences: closure properties and automatic identity proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an algebraically closed field $K$, a dynamical sequence over $K$ is a $K$-valued sequence of the form $a(n):= f(\phi^n(x_0))$, where $\phi\colon X\to X$ and $f\colon X\to\mathbb{A}^1$ are rational maps defined over $K$, and $x_0\in X$ is a point whose forward orbit avoids the indeterminacy loci of $\varphi$ and $f$. Many classical sequences from number theory and algebraic combinatorics fall under this dynamical framework, and we show that the class of dynamical sequences enjoys numerous closure properties and encompasses all elliptic divisibility sequences, all Somos sequences, and all $C^n$- and $D^n$-finite sequences for all $n\ge 1$, as defined by Jim\'enez-Pastor, Nuspl, and Pillwein. We also give an algorithm for proving that two dynamical sequences are identical and illustrate how to use this algorithm by showing how to prove several classical combinatorial identities via this method.</description>

      <title>Determining the Outerthickness of Graphs Is NP-Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a short, self-contained, and easily verifiable proof that determining the outerthickness of a general graph is NP-hard. This resolves a long-standing open problem on the computational complexity of outerthickness.
  Moreover, our hardness result applies to a more general covering problem $P_F$, defined as follows. Fix a proper graph class $F$ whose membership is decidable. Given an undirected simple graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the task is to cover the edge set $E(G)$ by at most $k$ subsets $E_1,\ldots,E_k$ such that each subgraph $(V(G),E_i)$ belongs to $F$. Note that if $F$ is monotone (in particular, when $F$ is the class of all outerplanar graphs), any such cover can be converted into an edge partition by deleting overlaps; hence, in this case, covering and partitioning are equivalent.
  Our result shows that for every proper graph class $F$ whose membership is decidable and that satisfies all of the following conditions: (a) $F$ is closed under topological minors, (b) $F$ is closed under $1$-sums, and (c) $F$ contains a cycle of length $3$, the problem $P_F$ is NP-hard for every fixed integer $k\ge 3$. In particular:
  For $F$ equal to the class of all outerplanar graphs, our result settles the long-standing open problem on the complexity of determining outerthickness.
  For $F$ equal to the class of all planar graphs, our result complements Mansfield's NP-hardness result for the thickness, which applies only to the case $k=2$.
  It is also worth noting that each of the three conditions above is necessary. If $F$ is the class of all eulerian graphs, then cond. (a) fails. If $F$ is the class of all pseudoforests, then cond. (b) fails. If $F$ is the class of all forests, then cond. (c) fails. For each of these three classes $F$, the problem $P_F$ is solvable in polynomial time for every fixed integer $k\ge 3$, showing that none of the three conditions can be dropped.</description>

      <title>Generalized binomial edge ideals of whisker graphs via an extension of generalized corona products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of generalized binomial edge ideals of whisker graphs by working within a substantially broader class of graphs. We extend the notion of generalized corona products, and through this enlarged framework, investigate fundamental algebraic invariants such as depth, (Castelnuovo-Mumford) regularity, and the Cohen-Macaulay property. In particular, we establish a sharp lower bound on the depth of generalized binomial edge ideals for our extended class, and further obtain explicit depth formula for a broad subclass of this family, which in turn recovers the depth formula for whisker graphs. We also establish sharp upper bounds for the regularity, and in the case of binomial edge ideals of whisker graphs over gap-free graphs, determine the exact value of the regularity. Finally, for our extended class, we provide a combinatorial classification of all Cohen-Macaulay binomial edge ideals, which in turn yields a new construction of Cohen-Macaulay binomial edge ideals.</description>

      <title>Independence of homogeneous GKM manifolds and symmetric spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G/H$ be a simply connected homogeneous space of maximal rank. Then the maximal torus $T$-action on $G/H$ is a GKM manifold. We call the $T$-action $j$-independent if any $i(\leq j)$ pairwise distinct isotropy weights at a fixed point are linearly independent. Using weighted graphs, we show that the maximal independence of $G/H$ is $2$, $3$ or $n=\dim T$, and that the cases of $3$ or $n=\dim T$ correspond to some symmetric spaces of rank $&gt;2$. As a corollary, using the results of Ayzenberg and Masuda, the lower-degree reduced homology groups (with appropriate coefficients) of the orbit space $T\backslash G/H$ vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate bi-periodic Padovan and bi-periodic Perrin quaternions over the quaternion algebra Q_Zp. We introduce the bi-periodic Perrin sequence and clarify its structural relationship with the bi-periodic Padovan sequence. By extending these sequences to the quaternion setting, we analyze their norm properties in the modular framework. For suitable choices of twin prime coefficients, we derive explicit criteria characterizing zero divisors and invertible elements in Q_Zp.</description>

      <title>On homological invariants and Cohen-Macaulayness of closed neighborhood ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph and $NI(G)$ be the closed neighborhood ideal of $G$ in the polynomial ring $S=K[V(G)]$. In this paper, we study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, projective dimension and Cohen-Macaulayness of this ideal. For any chordal graph $G$, we show that $\text{reg}(S/NI(G))=\tau(G)$, where $\tau(G)$ denotes the vertex cover number of $G$. This generalizes the corresponding result for trees shown in \cite{CJRS}, as in trees $\tau(G)$ is the same as the matching number of $G$. When $G$ is a bipartite graph or a very well-covered graph, we notice that $\text{reg}(S/NI(G))\geq \tau(G)$ and that this inequality can be strict in general. Moreover, we describe the projective dimension of $S/NI(G)$ for some families of graphs. Finally, we give a characterization of very well-covered graphs $G$ for which the ring $S/NI(G)$ is Cohen-Macaulay.</description>

      <title>On the position matrix of single-shelf shuffle and card guessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical shufflers used in many casinos employ a card shuffling scheme called \emph{shelf shuffling}. In a single-shelf shuffling, cards arrive sequentially, and each incoming card is independently placed on the top or the bottom of a shelf with equal probability. The position matrix of a single-shelf shuffling encodes the probability that the $i$-th incoming card is in position $j$ after one round of single-shelf shuffle. The spectral properties of the position matrix of card shuffling schemes are helpful in the analysis of card guessing games without feedback. In this paper, we determine the full spectrum and the corresponding eigenspaces of the position matrix $M$ of a single-shelf shuffle. This strengthens and resolves two conjectures in a recent work [arXiv:2507.10294]. As a consequence of these results, we show that the maximum number of expected correct guesses without feedback after $k\geq (1+\epsilon)$ many shuffles is of the order $1+O(n^{-2\epsilon})$. On the other hand, the expected number of correct guesses after one shuffle is at most $\sqrt{2n/\pi}+1+O(n^{-1/2})$, and we give a strategy (not optimal) that achieves $\sqrt{2n/\pi}-1$ number of correct cards in expectation.</description>

      <title>GKM Theory for Manifolds of Isospectral Matrices in Lie Type D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the manifold $Q_{\Gamma, \lambda}$ of isospectral real skew-symmetric matrices with a prescribed sparsity pattern determined by a graph $\Gamma$. The compact torus $T^n$ acts naturally on $Q_{\Gamma,\lambda}$ by conjugation, and this action can be studied using GKM theory. We prove two results about this manifold and its GKM graph. The first theorem describes how the GKM graph of $Q_{\Gamma, \lambda}$ is obtained from the GKM graph of the corresponding manifold $M_{\Gamma, \lambda}$ of isospectral Hermitian matrices. The second theorem gives a criterion for equivariant formality of $Q_{\Gamma, \lambda}$.</description>

      <title>Plethysm is in #BQP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some representation-theoretic multiplicities, such as the Kostka and the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, admit a combinatorial interpretation that places their computation in the complexity class #P. Whether this holds more generally is considered an important open problem in mathematics and computer science, with relevance for geometric complexity theory and quantum information. Recent work has investigated the quantum complexity of particular multiplicities, such as the Kronecker coefficients and certain special cases of the plethysm coefficients.
  Here, we show that a broad class of representation-theoretic multiplicities is in #BQP. In particular, our result implies that the plethysm coefficients are in #BQP, which was only known in special cases. It also implies all known results on the quantum complexity of previously studied coefficients as special cases, unifying, simplifying, and extending prior work. We obtain our result by multiple applications of the Schur transform. Recent work has improved its dependence on the local dimension, which is crucial for our work. We further describe a general approach for showing that representation-theoretic multiplicities are in #BQP that captures our approach as well as the approaches of prior work. We complement the above by showing that the same multiplicities are also naturally in GapP and obtain polynomial-time classical algorithms when certain parameters are fixed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two efficient algorithms for generating uniform random directed acyclic graphs, including an asymptotically optimal exact-size sampler that performs $\frac{n^2}{2} + o(n^2)$ operations and requests to a random generator. This was achieved by extending the Boltzmann model for graphical generating functions and by using various decompositions of directed acyclic graphs. The presented samplers improve upon the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of theoretical complexity and offer a significant speed-up in practice.</description>

      <title>An arithmetic method algorithm optimizing k-nearest neighbors compared to regression algorithms and evaluated on real world data sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear regression analysis focuses on predicting a numeric regressand value based on certain regressor values. In this context, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a common non-parametric regression algorithm, which achieves efficient performance when compared with other algorithms in literature. In this research effort an optimization of the k-NN algorithm is proposed by exploiting the potentiality of an introduced arithmetic method, which can provide solutions for linear equations involving an arbitrary number of real variables. Specifically, an Arithmetic Method Algorithm (AMA) is adopted to assess the efficiency of the introduced arithmetic method, while an Arithmetic Method Regression (AMR) algorithm is proposed as an optimization of k-NN adopting the potentiality of AMA. Such algorithm is compared with other regression algorithms, according to an introduced optimal inference decision rule, and evaluated on certain real world data sources, which are publicly available. Results are promising since the proposed AMR algorithm has comparable performance with the other algorithms, while in most cases it achieves better performance than the k-NN. The output results indicate that introduced AMR is an optimization of k-NN.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of finite \'etale spaces and generalized inflations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation of a simplicial complex $K$ is a construction well known in combinatorial topology. It replaces each vertex $i$ of $K$ with a finite number $n_i$ of its copies, and each simplex $\{i_0,\ldots,i_k\}$ with $n_{i_0}n_{i_1}\cdots n_{i_k}$ many copies so that the collection of vertex-copies is spanned by a simplex in the inflation if and only if their originals were spanned by a simplex in the original complex. The celebrated poset fiber theorem of Bj\"{o}rner, Wachs, and Welker describes the homotopy type of such inflation in terms of homotopy types of $K$ and its links. In the current paper, we introduce more general inflations over simplicial posets: we replace each simplex with an arbitrary finite set of copies. The way how these sets patch together is specified by a commutative diagram, or, equivalently, a sheaf on the corresponding finite topology. The generalized inflation can be understood as \'etale space of such sheaf. We prove that, whenever this inflation sheaf is flabby, the poset fiber theorem still applies. We prove all results similar to those known for vertex inflations. We also cover the previous result of the first author about homotopy types of clique complexes of multigraphs.</description>

Abstract: We derive Singleton-type bounds on the free distance and column distances of trellis codes. Our results show that, at a given time instant, the maximum attainable column distance of trellis codes can exceed that of convolutional codes. Moreover, using expander graphs, we construct trellis codes over constant-size alphabets that achieve a rate-distance trade-off arbitrarily close to that of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile. By comparison, all known constructions of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile require working over alphabets whose size grows at least exponentially with the number of output symbols per time instant.</description>

Abstract: By extracting coefficients from Wilf-Zeilberger pairs with respect to auxiliary parameters, we discover many nontrivial hypergeometric series involving harmonic numbers. In particular, we obtain a rapidly convergent series for the depth-two multiple zeta value $\zeta(5,3)$, which appears to be the first result of its kind in the literature. We also experiment with the Hilbert-Poincare series attached with a WZ-seed and conjecture that it admits a remarkably simple form, suggesting the presence of an underlying graded algebra structure behind WZ-seeds.</description>

We also prove that for every $\omega^{nk+3}$-large set $X$ with $\min X \geq 18$, every coloring $f : [X]^2 \to k$ admits an $\omega^n$-large $f$-homogeneous subset. This bound is tight, up to an additive constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an important inverse problem in topological data analysis (TDA): How many different barcodes produce the same Betti curve? Equivalently, given a function $\beta\colon [n]=\{1&lt;\cdots&lt; n\} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, how many different ways can we write $\beta$ as a sum of indicator functions supported on intervals in $[n]$? Our answer to this question is to connect persistent homology with the study of the Kostant partition function and the enumerative combinatorics for so-called "magic" juggling sequences studied by Ronald Graham and others. Specifically, we prove an equivalence between our inverse problem and corresponding statements in these other two settings. From an applications and statistics point of view, our work provides a quantification of how lossy the TDA pipeline is when moving from persistent homology to persistent Betti numbers.</description>

      <title>On prescribing total preorders and linear orders to pairwise distances of points in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any total preorder on a set with $\binom{n}{2}$ elements coincides with the order on pairwise distances of some point collection of size $n$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. For linear orders, a collection of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$ suffices. These bounds turn out to be optimal. We also find an optimal bound in a bipartite version for total preorders and a near-optimal bound for a bipartite version for linear orders. Our arguments include tools from convexity and positive semidefinite quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Cops and robbers pebbling in graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we merge the two fields of Cops and Robbers and Graph Pebbling to introduce the new topic of Cops and Robbers Pebbling. Both paradigms can be described by moving tokens (the cops) along the edges of a graph to capture a special token (the robber). In Cops and Robbers, all tokens move freely, whereas, in Graph Pebbling, some of the chasing tokens disappear with movement while the robber is stationary. In Cops and Robbers Pebbling, some of the chasing tokens (cops) disappear with movement, while the robber moves freely. We define the cop pebbling number of a graph to be the minimum number of cops necessary to capture the robber in this context, and present upper and lower bounds and exact values, some involving various domination parameters, for an array of graph classes, including paths, cycles, trees, chordal graphs, high girth graphs, and cop-win graphs, as well as graph products. Furthermore we show that the analogous inequality for Graham's Pebbling Conjecture fails for cop pebbling and posit a conjecture along the lines of Meyniel's Cops and Robbers Conjecture that may hold for cop pebbling. We also offer several new problems.</description>

      <title>A canonical Ramsey theorem with list constraints in random (hyper-)graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated canonical Ramsey theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Rado implies that for a given $k$-uniform hypergraph (or $k$-graph) $H$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then any colouring of the edges of the complete $k$-graph $K^{(k)}_n$ gives rise to copies of $H$ that exhibit certain colour patterns. We are interested in sparse random versions of this result and the threshold at which the random $k$-graph ${\mathbf{G}}^{(k)}(n,p)$ inherits the canonical Ramsey properties of $K^{(k)}_n$. Our main result here pins down this threshold when we focus on colourings that are constrained by some prefixed lists. This result is applied in an accompanying work of the authors on the threshold for the canonical Ramsey property (with no list constraints) in the case that $H$ is a (2-uniform) even cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the notion of Wilf-Zeilberger seeds as a natural framework for generating WZ-pairs and for lifting classical hypergeometric identities to the $q$-setting. As an application, we systematically obtain a large family of $q$-analogues of Ramanujan-type $1/\pi^k$ formulas, extending a literature previously limited to sporadic examples. While the majority of these $q$-analogues are modular, we also uncover several curious instances of mock modularity.</description>

      <title>Packing sets under finite groups via algebraic incidence structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05377v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group acting on a vector space $V = \mathbb{F}_p^n$ over a prime field. Given finite sets $S \subset G$ and $E \subset V$, we study the restricted orbit union $S(E) = \bigcup_{g\in S} g(E)$ and establish quantitative lower bounds for $|S(E)|$ in terms of $|S|$, $|E|$, and natural structural conditions. This finite field packing problem has connections to distance geometry, configuration counting, and expanding graphs. For $G = SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acting on $\mathbb{F}_p^2$, we prove that $$|S(E)| \gg \min\left\lbrace p^2, \frac{|S||E|}{p^2}\right\rbrace,$$ which is sharp. Under geometric non-concentration conditions on $E$ and subgroup-avoidance hypotheses on $S$, we obtain a power-saving improvement of the form $$|S(E)|\gg \min \left\lbrace p^2, ~\max\left\lbrace\frac{|S||E|}{pk}, ~\frac{|S|^{\frac{1}{2}}|E|}{p^{\frac{1-\epsilon}{2}}k^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right\rbrace \right\rbrace,$$ where $k$ bounds the radial multiplicity of $E$. For small sets $|E| \leq p$, we establish optimal bounds using weighted incidence theory. Analogous results are proved for the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acting on $\mathbb{F}_p^3$. Our approach reformulates the problem as an incidence question in a bipartite action graph. The proofs combine Fourier analytic techniques, energy estimates, point-line incidence bounds, and area-energy inequalities for skew dot products. The methods extend classical sum-product type problems and incidence theory to noncommutative group actions.</description>

      <title>VC-dimensions Between Partially Ordered Sets and Totally Ordered Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that two partial orders on $[n]$ are compatible if there exists a partial order that refines both of them. This compatibility relation induces a natural set system structure between the collection $\mathcal{F}$ of all partial orders and the collection $\mathcal{G}$ of all total orders on $[n]$, where each order is associated with the set of orders compatible with it.
  In this note, we determine the VC-dimension of $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to $\mathcal{G}$, proving that $\operatorname{VC}_{\mathcal{G}}(\mathcal{F}) = \lfloor\frac{n^2}{4}\rfloor$ for $n \ge 4$. We also establish bounds on the dual VC-dimension, showing that $2(n-3) \le \operatorname{VC}_{\mathcal{F}}(\mathcal{G}) \le n \log_2 n$ for all $n \ge 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02563v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\lambda_3$ denote the third largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this paper, we prove various results towards the conjecture that $\lambda_3(G) \le \frac{|V(G)|}{3}$, motivated by a question of Nikiforov. We generalise the known constructions that yield $\lambda_3(G) = \frac{|V(G)|}{3} - 1$ and prove the inequality holds for $G$ strongly regular, a regular line graph or a Cayley graph on an abelian group. We also consider the extended problem of minimising $\lambda_{n-1}$ on weighted graphs and reduce the existence of a minimiser with simple final eigenvalue to a vertex multiplication of a graph on 11 vertices. We prove that the minimal $\lambda_{n-1}$ over weighted graphs is at most $O(\sqrt{n})$ from the minimal $\lambda_{n-1}$ over unweighted graphs.</description>

      <title>Young domination on Hamming rectangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of domination-type problems in Cartesian products of two graphs. The framework captures several well-studied topics, including variants of bootstrap percolation, line growth, distance domination, and target set selection. We focus on Cartesian products of two complete graphs and formulate the notion of Young domination number in terms of a growth rule determined by a Young diagram; this number is the smallest cardinality of an initial set that covers the entire vertex set in a prescribed number $L$ of iterations of the rule.
  We compute the Young domination number with $L=1$ for several natural cases, including $k$-domination for Cartesian products of two complete graphs of the same order, thereby proving a conjecture from 2009 due to Burchett, Lane, and Lachniet. We show that the case of $L=1$ of Young domination is equivalent to computing bipartite Tur\'an numbers for families of double stars, yielding implications of our results in extremal graph theory. For arbitrary fixed $L$, we devise constant-factor approximation algorithms for the problem. Our approach is based on a variety of techniques, including duality between Young diagrams, algebraic formulations, explicit constructions, and dynamic programming.</description>

Abstract: A meta-conjecture of Coulson, Keevash, Perarnau and Yepremyan states that above the extremal threshold for a given spanning structure in a (hyper-)graph, one can find a rainbow version of that spanning structure in any suitably bounded colouring of the host (hyper-)graph. We solve one of the most pertinent outstanding cases of this conjecture, by showing that for any $1\leq j\leq k-1$, if $G$ is a $k$-uniform hypergraph above the $j$-degree threshold for a loose Hamilton cycle, then any globally bounded colouring of $G$ contains a rainbow loose Hamilton cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$, a graph $G$ is weakly $F$-saturated if all non-edges of $G$ can be added in some order so that each new edge introduces a copy of $F$. The weak saturation number $\operatorname{wsat}(n, F)$ is the minimum number of edges in a weakly $F$-saturated graph on $n$ vertices. Bollob\'as initiated the study of weak saturation in 1968 to study percolation processes, which originated in biology and have applications in physics and computer science. It was shown by Alon that for each $F$, there is a constant $w_F$ such that $\operatorname{wsat}(n, F) = w_Fn + o(n)$. We characterize all possible rational values of $w_F$, proving in particular that $w_F$ can equal any rational number at least $\frac 32$.</description>

Abstract: Lov\'{a}sz et al. proved that every $6$-edge-connected graph has a nowhere-zero $3$-flow. In fact, they proved a more technical statement which says that there exists a nowhere zero $3$-flow that extends the flow prescribed on the incident edges of a single vertex $z$ with bounded degree. We extend this theorem of Lov\'{a}sz et al. to allow $z$ to have arbitrary degree, but with the additional assumption that there is another vertex $x$ with large degree and no small cut separating $x$ and $z$. Using this theorem, we prove two results regarding the generation of minimal graphs with the property that prescribing the edges incident to a vertex with specific flow does not extend to a nowhere-zero $3$-flow. We use this to further strengthen the theorem of Lov\'{a}sz et al., as well as make progress on a conjecture of Li et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a ratio of Schur polynomials $s_{\lambda}/s_{\rho}$ associated to partitions $\lambda$ and $\rho$ such that $\lambda\subsetneq\rho$ has a negative partial derivative at any point where all variables are positive. This is accomplished by establishing an injective map between sets of pairs of skew semistandard Young tableaux that preserves the product of the corresponding monomials. We use this result and the description of the first Laurent coefficient of the Hilbert series of the graded algebra of regular functions on a linear symplectic quotient by the circle to demonstrate that many such symplectic quotients are not graded regularly diffeomorphic. In addition, we give an upper bound for this Laurent coefficient in terms of the largest two weights of the circle representation and demonstrate that all but finitely many circle symplectic quotients of each dimension are not graded regularly diffeomorphic to linear symplectic quotients by $\operatorname{SU}_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19560v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ be a hyperbolic quadric of $\PG(2n+1,q)$. Fix a generator $\Pi$ of the quadric. Define $\cG_n$ as the graph with vertex set the points of $Q^+(2n+1,q)\setminus \Pi$ and two vertices adjacent if they either span a secant to $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ or a line contained in $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ meeting $\Pi$ non-trivially. Then such a construction defines a strongly regular graph, which is the complement of a (non-induced) subgraph of the collinearity graph of $Q^+(2n+1,q)$. In this paper, we directly compute the parameters of $\cG_n$, which is cospectral, when $q=2$, to the tangent graph $NO^+(2n+2,2)$, but it is non-isomorphic for $n\geq3$. We also classify the maximal cliques of $\cG_3$ for $q=2$, proving as a by-product the non-isomorphism with the graph $NO^+(8,2)$.</description>

Abstract: We develop an analytic approach that draws on tools from Fourier analysis and ergodic theory to study Ramsey-type problems involving sums and products in the integers. Suppose $Q$ denotes a polynomial with integer coefficients. We establish two main results. First, we show that if $Q(1) = 0$, then any set of natural numbers with positive upper logarithmic density contains a pair of the form $\{x + Q(y), xy\}$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{1\}$. Second, we prove that if $Q(0) = 0$, then any set of natural numbers with positive density relative to a new multiplicative notion of density, which arises naturally in the context of such problems, contains $\{x + Q(y), xy\}$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Colorful Minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of colorful minors, which generalizes the classical concept of rooted minors in graphs. A $q$-colorful graph is defined as a pair $(G, \chi),$ where $G$ is a graph and $\chi$ assigns to each vertex a (possibly empty) subset of at most $q$ colors. The colorful minor relation enhances the classical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing the removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models algorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated vertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing three core theorems characterizing $\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where $\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned all colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face. Our results reveal that when exclusion is imposed not only on graphs but also to the way colors are distributed in them, a more refined structural landscape appears.
  Leveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification -- parameterized by the number $q$ of colors -- of all colorful graphs that exhibit the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the algorithmic side, we deduce that colorful minor testing is fixed-parameter tractable. Together with the fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this implies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits a fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic meta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of treewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs. Our results suggest how known AMTs can be extended to incorporate not only the structure of the input graph but also the way the colored vertices are distributed in it.</description>

      <title>Twists, Higher Dimer Covers, and Web Duality for Grassmannian Cluster Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a twisted version of Fraser, Lam, and Le's higher boundary measurement map, using face weights instead of edge weights, thereby providing Laurent polynomial expansions, in Pl\"ucker coordinates, for twisted web immanants for Grassmannians. In some small cases, Fraser, Lam, and Le observe a phenomenon they call "web duality'', where web immanants coincide with web invariants, and they conjecture that this duality corresponds to transposing the standard Young tableaux that index basis webs. We show that this duality continues to hold for a large set of $\text{SL}_3$ and $\text{SL}_4$ webs. Combining this with our twisted higher boundary measurement map, we recover and extend formulas of Elkin-Musiker-Wright for twists of certain cluster variables. We also provide evidence supporting conjectures of Fomin-Pylyavskyy as well as one by Cheung-Dechant-He-Heyes-Hirst-Li concerning classification of cluster variables of low Pl\"ucker degree in $\mathbb{C}[\text{Gr}(3,n)]$.</description>

      <title>Localization game capture time of trees and outerplanar graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The localization game is a variant of the game of Cops and Robber in which the robber is invisible and moves between adjacent vertices, but the cops can probe any $k$ vertices of the graph to obtain the distance between probed vertices and the robber. The localization number of a graph is the minimum $k$ needed for cops to be able to locate the robber in finite time. The localization capture time is the number of rounds needed for cops to win.
  The localization capture time conjecture claims that there exists a constant $C$ such that the localization number of every connected graph on $n$ vertices is at most $Cn$. While it is known that the conjecture holds for trees, in this paper we significantly improve the known upper bound for the localization capture time of trees. We also prove the conjecture for a subclass of outerplanar graphs and present a generalization of the localization game that appears useful for making further progress towards the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the construction and large $N$ study of the continuous two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ through probability, combinatorics and representation theory. In the first part, we define the continuous Yang--Mills measure using Markovian holonomy fields, following a construction by L\'evy, then we show in the second part how to derive the character expansion of the partition function for any compact structure group from this setting. We continue with two developments obtained in the last few years by Dahlqvist, Lemoine, L\'evy and Ma\"ida with similar approaches with respect to the partition function: its large-$N$ asymptotics on all compact surfaces for the structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$, and its $\frac{1}{N}$ expansion on a torus with an interpretation in terms of random surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{Z}\longrightarrow \{ \times \cdot\}$ be a function such that $f(a) = \cdot$ for all except finitely for
  many $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. We define a set $\flat f$ of non-intersecting arc (or cap) diagrams satisfying certain conditions determined by $f$. Then we give a recursive method for enumeration of $\flat f$ which recalls the Fundamental Recurrence for Catalan numbers. The motivation comes from the problem of enumeration of the
  composition factors of a Kac module with maximum degree of atypicality for the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{gl}(r|r)$. In particular we prove a conjecture that the maximum number of
  composition factors is a Catalan number.</description>

      <title>Diameter Bounds for Friends-and-Strangers Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider two $n$-vertex graphs $X$ and $Y$, where we interpret $X$ as a social network with edges representing friendships and $Y$ as a movement graph with edges representing adjacent positions. The friends-and-strangers graph $\mathsf{FS}(X,Y)$ is a graph on the $n!$ permutations $V(X)\to V(Y)$, where two configurations are adjacent if and only if one can be obtained from the other by swapping two friends located on adjacent positions. Friends-and-strangers graphs were first introduced by Defant and Kravitz, and generalize sliding puzzles as well as token swapping problems. Previous work has largely focused on their connectivity properties.
  In this paper, we study the diameter of the connected components of $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$. We extend the result of Kornhauser, Miller, and Spirakis on sliding puzzles to general graphs in two ways. First, we show that the diameter of $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$ is polynomially bounded when both the friendship and the movement graphs have large minimum degree. Second, when both the underlying graphs $X$ and $Y$ are Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, we show that the distance between any pair of configurations is almost always polynomially bounded under certain conditions on the edge probabilities.</description>

      <title>Explicit Formulas and Combinatorial Interpretation of Triangular Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the lattice $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$, we derive a general formula for the sequences $\big(T(n,k)\big)_{n,k\in \mathbb{N}}$ satysfying the recurence relation of the form:
  \begin{equation*}
  T(n,k)=a_{n,k}T(n-1,k)+b_{n,k}T(n-1,k-1).
  \end{equation*}
  We apply this result to the case where $a_{n,k}=a_0+a_1k+a_2n$ and $b_{n,k}=b_0+b_1k+b_2n$.
  This leads to explicit expressions for general $T(n,k)$, with simpler formulas arising in the case $b_2=0$, as well as in the fully general case, using Fa\`a di Bruno's type expression. In particular, we will analyze the case $b_{n,k}=1$, which frequently occurs in enumerative combinatorics. Applications include explicit formulas for the $r$-Eulerian numbers. We will write also the case where $b_{n,k}=1$, as a matrix of passage.
  \textbf{Keywords:} triangular recurrence, weighted paths, $r$-Eulerian numbers, combinatorial interpretation.</description>

      <title>Graph Limits via Quotients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new notion of limits of weighted directed graphs of growing size based on convergence of their random quotients. These limits are specified in terms of random exchangeable measures on the unit square. We call our limits grapheurs and show that these are dual to graphons in a precise sense. Grapheurs are well-suited to modeling global structure in large graphs such as hubs and connections between them; previous notions of graph limits based on subgraph densities fail to adequately model such global structure as subgraphs are inherently local. Using our framework, we characterize properties of large graphs that are continuous with respect to our limits and present an edge-based sampling approach for testing them. This method relies on an edge-based analog of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma, whereby we show that sampling a constant number of edges from an arbitrarily-large graph approximately preserves its quotients. Finally, we observe that the random quotients of a graph are related to each other by equipartitions, and we conclude with a characterization of such random graph models.</description>

We show that on this basis, the descent algebra acts by triangular operators, thus making it an analogue of a cellular basis.

      <title>On the number of generalized cospectral mates of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes an upper bound on the number of generalized cospectral mates of simple graphs, where the generalized spectrum consists of the spectrum of a graph and its complement. Moving beyond the classical problem of identifying graphs determined by their generalized spectrum, we address the more quantitative question of how many non-isomorphic graphs can share the same generalized spectrum. Our approach is based on arithmetic constraints derived from the Smith Normal Form (SNF) of the walk matrix, which leads to a tight upper bound on the number of generalized cospectral mates of a graph. Our upper bound applies to a much broader class of graphs than those previously shown to have no generalized cospectral mates (graphs determined by generalized spectrum). Consequently, this work extends the family of graphs for which strong and informative spectral uniqueness results are available.</description>

Abstract: Subtraction games are a classical topic in Combinatorial Game Theory. A result of Golomb~(1966) shows that every subtraction game with a finite move set has an eventually periodic nim-sequence, but the known proof yields only an exponential upper bound on the period length. Flammenkamp (1997) conjectures a striking classification for three-move subtraction games: non-additive rulesets exhibit linear period lengths of the form ``the sum of two moves'', where the choice of which two moves displays fractal-like behavior, while additive sets $S=\{a,b,a+b\}$ have purely periodic outcomes with linear or quadratic period lengths. Despite early attention in \emph{Winning Ways} (1982), the general additive case remains open. We introduce and analyze a dual winning convention, which we call {\sc sink subtraction}. Unlike the standard wall convention, where moves to negative positions are forbidden, the sink convention declares a player the winner upon moving to a non-positive position. We show that {\sc additive sink subtraction} admits a complete solution: the nim-sequence is purely periodic with an explicit linear or quadratic period formula, and we conjecture a duality between additive sink subtraction and classical wall subtraction. Keywords: Additive Subtraction Game, Nimber, Periodicity, Sink Convention.</description>

Abstract: The study of the flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}_n$ and its subvarieties, including Schubert and Richardson varieties, plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics. In this paper, we introduce and develop the theory of tilted Richardson varieties $\mathrm{T}_{u,v}$, a new family of subvarieties of the flag variety that provides a geometric framework for the quantum Bruhat graphs. These varieties are defined for all pairs of permutations $u$ and $v$, extending the classical Richardson varieties in the case where $u\leq v$ in the Bruhat order. We establish their fundamental geometric properties, proving irreducibility and providing explicit dimension formulas. Moreover, we show that they have a well-defined stratification indexed by tilted Bruhat intervals, a generalization of classical Bruhat intervals previously introduced by Brenti, Fomin, and Postnikov. Additionally, we introduce a tilted generalization of the classical Deodhar decomposition of Richardson varieties, which leads to a combinatorial formula for tilted Kazhdan--Lusztig R-polynomials, a notion that arises naturally in our framework.
  We further develop a theory of total positivity for tilted Richardson varieties. In particular, we define and study the totally nonnegative parts of tilted Richardson varieties, proving they form a CW complex. This generalizes earlier results on the totally nonnegative flag variety and answers Bj\"orner's questions regarding geometric realizations of tilted Bruhat intervals.
  Finally, we establish explicit connections between tilted Richardson varieties and quantum Schubert calculus. Specifically, we prove that $\mathrm{T}_{u,v}$ coincides with minimal-degree two-point curve neighborhoods. As a result, we compute their cohomology classes and derive new relationships among Gromov--Witten invariants of the flag variety.</description>

      <title>Quickly excluding an annotated planar graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide proofs certifying that the structure theorem for vertex sets of bounded bidimensionality holds with polynomial bounds. The bidimensionality of vertex sets is a common generalisation of both treewidth and the face-cover-number of vertex sets in planar graphs. As such, it plays a crucial role in extensions of Courcelle's Theorem to $H$-minor-free graphs. Recently, bidimensionality and similar parameters have emerged as key for extensions of known parameterized algorithms for problems defined on a terminal set $R$. A prominent example for such a problem is Steiner Tree, which admits efficient algorithms on planar graphs whenever $R$ can be covered with few faces.
  Key to the algorithmic applications of bidimensionality is a structure theorem that explains how a graph $G$ can be decomposed into pieces where the behaviour of $R$ is highly controlled. One may see this structure theorem as a rooted analogue of Robertson and Seymour's celebrated Grid Theorem. Combining recent advances in obtaining polynomial bounds in the Graph Minors framework with new techniques for handling annotated vertex sets, we show that all parameters in the structure theorem above admit polynomial bounds. As an application, we also provide a sketch showing how our techniques imply polynomial bounds for the structure theorem for graphs excluding an apex minor.</description>

      <title>Multiple ergodic averages along functions from a Hardy field: convergence, recurrence and combinatorial applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.03558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain new results pertaining to convergence and recurrence of multiple ergodic averages along functions from a Hardy field. Among other things, we confirm some of the conjectures posed by Frantzikinakis in [Fra10; Fra16] and obtain combinatorial applications which contain, as rather special cases, several previously known (polynomial and non-polynomial) extensions of Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progressions [BL96; BLL08; FW09; Fra10; BMR17]. One of the novel features of our results, which is not present in previous work, is that they allow for a mixture of polynomials and non-polynomial functions. As an illustration, assume $f_i(t)=a_{i,1}t^{c_{i,1}}+\cdots+a_{i,d}t^{c_{i,d}}$ for $c_{i,j}&gt;0$ and $a_{i,j}\in\mathbb{R}$. Then
  $\bullet$ for any measure preserving system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T)$ and $h_1,\dots,h_k\in L^\infty(X)$, the limit $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N T^{[f_1(n)]}h_1\cdots T^{[f_k(n)]}h_k$$ exists in $L^2$;
  $\bullet$ for any $E\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $\overline{\mathrm{d}}(E)&gt;0$ there are $a,n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\{a,\, a+[f_1(n)],\ldots,a+[f_k(n)]\}\subset E$.
  We also show that if $f_1,\dots,f_k$ belong to a Hardy field, have polynomial growth, and are such that no linear combination of them is a polynomial, then for any measure preserving system $(X,{\mathcal B},\mu,T)$ and any $A\in{\mathcal B}$, $$\limsup_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N\mu\Big(A\cap T^{-[ f_1(n) ]}A\cap\ldots\cap T^{-[f_k(n)]}A\Big)\,\geq\,\mu(A)^{k+1}.$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In tug-of-war, two players compete by moving a counter along edges of a graph, each winning the right to move at a given turn according to the flip of a possibly biased coin. The game ends when the counter reaches the boundary, a fixed subset of the vertices, at which point one player pays the other an amount determined by the boundary vertex. Economists and mathematicians have independently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on resource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend precious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine the turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias game in a Euclidean setting.
  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war games with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget which she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each turn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the sum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary being the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a single distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique Nash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any given turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been placed. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained at its initial value $\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic function; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given turn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\lambda$-derivative of game value. We also indicate examples in which the solution takes a different form in the non-leisurely game.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Combinatorial Approach to Proving Chernoff Bounds and Their Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chernoff bound is one of the most widely used tools in theoretical computer science. It's rare to find a randomized algorithm that doesn't employ a Chernoff bound in its analysis. The standard proofs of Chernoff bounds are beautiful but in some ways not very intuitive. In this paper, I'll show you a different proof that has four features: (1) the proof offers a strong intuition for why Chernoff bounds look the way that they do; (2) the proof is user-friendly and (almost) algebra-free; (3) the proof comes with matching lower bounds, up to constant factors in the exponent; and (4) the proof extends to establish generalizations of Chernoff bounds in other settings. The ultimate goal is that, once you know this proof (and with a bit of practice), you should be able to confidently reason about Chernoff-style bounds in your head, extending them to other settings, and convincing yourself that the bounds you're obtaining are tight (up to constant factors in the exponent).</description>

      <title>Correspondence among congruence families for generalized Frobenius partitions via modular permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2024, Garvan, Sellers and Smoot discovered a remarkable symmetry in the families of congruences for generalized Frobenius partitions $c\psi_{2,0}$ and $c\psi_{2,1}$. They also emphasized that the considerations for the general case of $c\psi_{k,\beta}$ are important for future work. In this paper, for each $k$ we construct a vector-valued modular form for the generating functions of $c\psi_{k,\beta}$, and determine an equivalence relation among all $\beta$. Within each equivalence class, we can identify modular transformations relating the congruences of one $c\psi_{k,\beta}$ to that of another $c\psi_{k,\beta'}$. Furthermore, correspondences between different equivalence classes can also be obtained through linear combinations of modular transformations. As an example, with the aid of these correspondences, we prove a family of congruences of $c\phi_{3}$, the Andrews' $3$-colored Frobenius partition.</description>

      <title>A monotonicity conjecture for the local maximal singularity of the Hilbert scheme of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Brian\c{c}on-Iarrobino conjecture predicts the maximum singularity of the Hilbert scheme of a tetrahedral number of points. As for the maximal singularities of the Hilbert scheme of a non-tetrahedral number of points, the second named author gave some separate conjectural necessary and sufficient conditions. In this paper, we provide a conjectural sufficient condition for the necessary condition, and propose a monotonicity conjecture which predicts that for a fixed colength $l$, the maximal dimension of the tangent space over all the Borel-fixed ideals of colength $l$ is increasing with respect to the smallest pure exponent of the ideal.</description>

      <title>Spectra of high-dimensional sparse random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral properties of the high-dimensional random geometric graph $G(n, d, p)$, formed by sampling $n$ i.i.d vectors $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ uniformly on a $d$-dimensional unit sphere and connecting each pair $\{i,j\}$ whenever $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle \geq \tau$ so that $p=\mathbb P(\langle v_i,v_j\rangle \geq \tau)$. This model defines a nonlinear random matrix ensemble with dependent entries. We show that if $d =\omega( np\log^{2}(1/p))$ and $np\to\infty$, the limiting spectral distribution of the normalized adjacency matrix $\frac{A}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$ is the semicircle law. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for $G(n, d, p)$ in the sparse regime. In the constant sparsity case $p=\alpha/n$, we further show that if $d=\omega(\log^2(n))$ the limiting spectral distribution of $A$ in $G(n,\alpha/n)$ coincides with that of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $G(n,\alpha/n)$.
  Our approach combines the classical moment method in random matrix theory with a novel recursive decomposition of closed-walk graphs, leveraging block-cut trees and ear decompositions, to control the moments of the empirical spectral distribution. A refined high trace analysis further yields a near-optimal bound on the second eigenvalue when $np=\Omega(\log^4 (n))$, removing technical conditions previously imposed in (Liu et al. 2023). As an application, we demonstrate that this improved eigenvalue bound sharpens the parameter requirements on $d$ and $p$ for spontaneous synchronization on random geometric graphs in (Abdalla et al. 2024) under the homogeneous Kuramoto model.</description>

      <title>On irrationals with Lagrange value exactly 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $c&gt;0$, let $X_c$ denote the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{cq^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$. It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c&gt;3$ and countable for $c&lt;3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable.
  More generally, we show that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ with Lagrange value exactly $3$ and such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has exactly $n$ rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ is also uncountable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores new arithmetic and combinatorial structures arising from the interplay between Farey-type graphs, Fibonacci expansions, and operadic constructions. We introduce Fibonadic numbers, defined as an inverse limit under the Zeckendorf shift, equipped with a metric, order, and commutative rig structure. A normalization lemma provides canonical representatives, while quotients of the non-zero Fibonadic numbers under shifts and it's fundamental domain covering the circle via phi-values. Levels with associated functions encoding the decomposition of X into arithmetic layers. This research links number theory, combinatorics, discrete dynamics, operads, fractal geometry and the golden ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the monoid algebra ${}_{n}\mathcal{T}_{m}$ of semistandard Young tableaux, which coincides with the Gelfand--Tsetlin semigroup ring $\mathcal{GT}_{n}$ when $m = n$. Among others, we show that this algebra is commutative, Noetherian, reduced, Koszul, and Cohen--Macaulay. We provide a complete classification of its maximal ideals and compute the topology of its maximal spectrum. Furthermore, we classify its irreducible modules and provide a faithful semisimple representation. We also establish that its associated variety coincides with a toric degeneration of certain partial flag varieties constructed by Gonciulea--Lakshmibai. As an application, we show that this algebra yields injective embeddings of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$-crystals, extending a result of Bossinger--Torres.</description>

      <title>Generalized discrete Markov spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the special subset of the Markov-Lagrange spectrum (and the Markov spectrum) called the discrete Markov spectrum. The discrete Markov spectrum is defined in terms of the Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz.$ Using the tool called snake graphs, originating from cluster algebra theory, we first reconstruct proofs of its properties in a combinatorial framework and then extend it to the generalized setting. We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</description>

      <title>Branch-width of connectivity functions is fixed-parameter tractable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connectivity function on a finite set $V$ is a symmetric submodular function $f \colon 2^V \to \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(\emptyset)=0$. We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} \gamma n^6 \log n$, where $\gamma$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2007], which runs in time $\gamma n^{O(k)}$. Our algorithm can be applied to rank-width of graphs, branch-width of matroids, branch-width of (hyper)graphs, and carving-width of graphs. This resolves an open problem asked by Hlin\v{e}n\'y [SIAM J. Comput., 2005], who asked whether branch-width of matroids given by the rank oracle is fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the best known dependency on $k$ in the running times of FPT algorithms for graph branch-width, rank-width, and carving-width.</description>

      <title>Community detection in network using Szegedy quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solving this problem uses the classical random walks on graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our community detection procedure to a variety of graphs and social networks, including the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, and the dolphin's social network, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The log-concavity of cluster variables of type $A_n$ and cluster monomials of type $A_2$ was established by Chen-Huang-Sun. It is still a conjecture for the cluster monomials of higher rank. In this paper, we prove the log-concavity and unimodality of the cluster monomials of type $A_3$, a substantially more intricate case. Moreover, we refine and extend this conjecture by considering the unimodality and the strongly isomorphism of cluster algebras.</description>

Abstract: Starting from a single solution of QYBE (or CYBE) we produce an infinite family of solutions of QYBE (or CYBE) parametrized by transitive arrays and, in particular, by signed permutations. We are especially interested in cases when such solutions yield quasi-triangular structures on direct powers of Lie bialgebras and tensor powers of Hopf algebras. We obtain infinite families of such structures as well and study the corresponding Poisson-Lie structures and co-quasi-triangular algebras.</description>

      <title>A two-player version of the assignment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the competitive assignment problem, a two-player version of the well-known assignment problem. Given a set of tasks and a set of agents with different efficiencies for different tasks, Alice and Bob take turns picking agents one by one. Once all agents have been picked, Alice and Bob compute the optimal values $s_A$ and $s_B$ for the assignment problem on their respective sets of agents, i.e. they assign their own agents to tasks (with at most one agent per task and at most one task per agent) so as to maximize the sum of the efficiencies. The score of the game is then defined as $s_A-s_B$. Alice aims at maximizing the score, while Bob aims at minimizing it. This problem can model drafts in sports and card games, or more generally situations where two entities fight for the same resources and then use them to compete against each other. We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to agents that have at most two nonzero efficiencies. On the other hand, in the case of agents having at most one nonzero efficiency, the problem lies in XP parameterized by the number of tasks, and the optimal score can be computed in linear time when there are only two tasks.</description>
