      <title>Speaker Disentanglement of Speech Pre-trained Model Based on Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech pretrained models contain task-specific information across different layers, but decoupling content and timbre information remains challenging as removing speaker-specific information often causes content loss. Current research lacks direct metrics to quantify timbre residual in model encodings, relying on indirect evaluation through downstream tasks. This paper addresses these challenges through interpretability-based speaker disentanglement in speech pretraining models. We quantitatively evaluate timbre residual in model embeddings and improve speaker disentanglement using interpretive representations. Our contributions include: (1) InterpTRQE-SptME Benchmark - a timbre residual recognition framework using interpretability. The benchmark concatenates content embeddings with timbre embeddings for speaker classification, then applies Gradient SHAP Explainer to quantify timbre residual. We evaluate seven speech pretraining model variations. (2) InterpTF-SptME method - an interpretability-based timbre filtering approach using SHAP Noise and SHAP Cropping techniques. This model-agnostic method transforms intermediate encodings to remove timbre while preserving content. Experiments on VCTK dataset with HuBERT LARGE demonstrate successful content preservation and significant speaker disentanglement optimization. Results show the SHAP Noise method can reduce timbre residual from 18.05% to near 0% while maintaining content integrity, contributing to enhanced performance in content-related speech processing tasks and preventing timbre privacy leakage.</description>

      <title>Bob's Confetti: Phonetic Memorization Attacks in Music and Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright, safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).</description>

      <title>Resnet-conformer network with shared weights and attention mechanism for sound event localization, detection, and distance estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report outlines our approach to Task 3A of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024, focusing on Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD). SELD provides valuable insights by estimating sound event localization and detection, aiding in various machine cognition tasks such as environmental inference, navigation, and other sound localization-related applications. This year's challenge evaluates models using either audio-only (Track A) or audiovisual (Track B) inputs on annotated recordings of real sound scenes. A notable change this year is the introduction of distance estimation, with evaluation metrics adjusted accordingly for a comprehensive assessment. Our submission is for Task A of the Challenge, which focuses on the audio-only track. Our approach utilizes log-mel spectrograms, intensity vectors, and employs multiple data augmentations. We proposed an EINV2-based [1] network architecture, achieving improved results: an F-score of 40.2%, Angular Error (DOA) of 17.7 degrees, and Relative Distance Error (RDE) of 0.32 on the test set of the Development Dataset [2 ,3].</description>

      <title>The TEA-ASLP System for Multilingual Conversational Speech Recognition and Speech Diarization in MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the TEA-ASLP's system submitted to the MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge, addressing multilingual conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR) in Task I and speech diarization ASR in Task II. For Task I, we enhance Ideal-LLM model by integrating known language identification and a multilingual MOE LoRA structure, along with using CTC-predicted tokens as prompts to improve autoregressive generation. The model is trained on approximately 180k hours of multilingual ASR data. In Task II, we replace the baseline English-Chinese speaker diarization model with a more suitable English-only version. Our approach achieves a 30.8% reduction in word error rate (WER) compared to the baseline speech language model, resulting in a final WER of 9.60% in Task I and a time-constrained minimum-permutation WER of 17.49% in Task II, earning first and second place in the respective challenge tasks.</description>

      <title>DIFFA: Large Language Diffusion Models Can Listen and Understand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across textual and multimodal domains. In parallel, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm, offering improved controllability, bidirectional context modeling, and robust generation. However, their application to the audio modality remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DIFFA}, the first diffusion-based Large Audio-Language Model designed to perform spoken language understanding. DIFFA integrates a frozen diffusion language model with a lightweight dual-adapter architecture that bridges speech understanding and natural language reasoning. We employ a two-stage training pipeline: first, aligning semantic representations via an ASR objective; then, learning instruction-following abilities through synthetic audio-caption pairs automatically generated by prompting LLMs. Despite being trained on only 960 hours of ASR and 127 hours of synthetic instruction data, DIFFA demonstrates competitive performance on major benchmarks, including MMSU, MMAU, and VoiceBench, outperforming several autoregressive open-source baselines. Our results reveal the potential of diffusion-based language models for efficient and scalable audio understanding, opening a new direction for speech-driven AI. Our code will be available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git.</description>

      <title>A Concept-based approach to Voice Disorder Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and the ability to diagnose them using automated, non-invasive techniques would represent a substantial advancement in healthcare, improving the quality of life of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can effectively address this task. However, due to their complexity, the decision-making process of such models often remain opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical contexts. This paper investigates an alternative approach based on Explainable AI (XAI), a field that aims to improve the interpretability of DNNs by providing different forms of explanations. Specifically, this works focuses on concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept Embedding Model (CEM) and how they can achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning methods, while offering a more transparent and interpretable decision framework.</description>

      <title>TELEVAL: A Dynamic Benchmark Designed for Spoken Language Models in Chinese Interactive Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance. However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models (LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress, existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.</description>

      <title>GOAT-SLM: A Spoken Language Model with Paralinguistic and Speaker Characteristic Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion, and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness, designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks, and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.</description>

      <title>Recent Trends in Distant Conversational Speech Recognition: A Review of CHiME-7 and 8 DASR Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges' design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1) Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation, suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques. Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive system ensembles.</description>

      <title>SpecASR: Accelerating LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition via Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently attracted a lot of attention due to its high recognition accuracy and enhanced multi-dialect support. However, the high decoding latency of LLMs challenges the real-time ASR requirements. Although speculative decoding has been explored for better decoding efficiency, they usually ignore the key characteristics of the ASR task and achieve limited speedup. To further reduce the real-time ASR latency, in this paper, we propose a novel speculative decoding framework specialized for ASR, dubbed SpecASR. SpecASR is developed based on our core observation that ASR decoding is audio-conditioned, which results in high output alignment between small and large ASR models, even given output mismatches in intermediate decoding steps. Therefore, SpecASR features an adaptive draft sequence generation process that dynamically modifies the draft sequence length to maximize the token acceptance length. SpecASR further proposes a draft sequence recycling strategy that reuses the previously generated draft sequence to reduce the draft ASR model latency. Moreover, a two-pass sparse token tree generation algorithm is also proposed to balance the latency of draft and target ASR models. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate SpecASR achieves 3.04x-3.79x and 1.25x-1.84x speedup over the baseline autoregressive decoding and speculative decoding, respectively, without any loss in recognition accuracy.</description>

      <title>Improving Bird Classification with Primary Color Additives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by 7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.</description>

      <title>Speech Enhancement with Dual-path Multi-Channel Linear Prediction Filter and Multi-norm Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a speech enhancement method us ing dual-path Multi-Channel Linear Prediction (MCLP) filters
  and multi-norm beamforming. Specifically, the MCLP part in
  the proposed method is designed with dual-path filters in both
  time and frequency dimensions. For the beamforming part, we
  minimize the power of the microphone array output as well as
  the l1 norm of the denoised signals while preserving source sig nals from the target directions. An efficient method to select the
  prediction orders in the dual-path filters is also proposed, which
  is robust for signals with different reverberation time (T60) val ues and can be applied to other MCLP-based methods. Eval uations demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the
  baseline methods for speech enhancement, particularly in high
  reverberation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tiny is not small enough: High-quality, low-resource facial animation models through hybrid knowledge distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset, recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven digital characters.</description>

      <title>Streaming Sortformer: Speaker Cache-Based Online Speaker Diarization with Arrival-Time Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a streaming extension for the Sortformer speaker diarization framework, whose key property is the arrival-time ordering of output speakers. The proposed approach employs an Arrival-Order Speaker Cache (AOSC) to store frame-level acoustic embeddings of previously observed speakers. Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings by speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically updated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past predictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined dynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and precise speaker tracking. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach, even in low-latency setups. These results establish Streaming Sortformer as a robust solution for real-time multi-speaker tracking and a foundation for streaming multi-talker speech processing.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Cross-Domain Audio-Visual Deception Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06995</link>

Abstract: Automated deception detection is crucial for assisting humans in accurately assessing truthfulness and identifying deceptive behavior. Conventional contact-based techniques, like polygraph devices, rely on physiological signals to determine the authenticity of an individual's statements. Nevertheless, recent developments in automated deception detection have demonstrated that multimodal features derived from both audio and video modalities may outperform human observers on publicly available datasets. Despite these positive findings, the generalizability of existing audio-visual deception detection approaches across different scenarios remains largely unexplored. To close this gap, we present the first cross-domain audio-visual deception detection benchmark, that enables us to assess how well these methods generalize for use in real-world scenarios. We used widely adopted audio and visual features and different architectures for benchmarking, comparing single-to-single and multi-to-single domain generalization performance. To further exploit the impacts using data from multiple source domains for training, we investigate three types of domain sampling strategies, including domain-simultaneous, domain-alternating, and domain-by-domain for multi-to-single domain generalization evaluation. We also propose an algorithm to enhance the generalization performance by maximizing the gradient inner products between modality encoders, named ``MM-IDGM". Furthermore, we proposed the Attention-Mixer fusion method to improve performance, and we believe that this new cross-domain benchmark will facilitate future research in audio-visual deception detection.</description>

      <title>Information and motor constraints shape melodic diversity across cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. These results provide strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and suggests that a tendency for intermediate melodic complexity reflects a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</description>

      <title>LENS-DF: Deepfake Detection and Temporal Localization for Long-Form Noisy Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces LENS-DF, a novel and comprehensive recipe for training and evaluating audio deepfake detection and temporal localization under complicated and realistic audio conditions. The generation part of the recipe outputs audios from the input dataset with several critical characteristics, such as longer duration, noisy conditions, and containing multiple speakers, in a controllable fashion. The corresponding detection and localization protocol uses models. We conduct experiments based on self-supervised learning front-end and simple back-end. The results indicate that models trained using data generated with LENS-DF consistently outperform those trained via conventional recipes, demonstrating the effectiveness and usefulness of LENS-DF for robust audio deepfake detection and localization. We also conduct ablation studies on the variations introduced, investigating their impact on and relevance to realistic challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>DiffRhythm+: Controllable and Flexible Full-Length Song Generation with Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Songs, as a central form of musical art, exemplify the richness of human intelligence and creativity. While recent advances in generative modeling have enabled notable progress in long-form song generation, current systems for full-length song synthesis still face major challenges, including data imbalance, insufficient controllability, and inconsistent musical quality. DiffRhythm, a pioneering diffusion-based model, advanced the field by generating full-length songs with expressive vocals and accompaniment. However, its performance was constrained by an unbalanced model training dataset and limited controllability over musical style, resulting in noticeable quality disparities and restricted creative flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose DiffRhythm+, an enhanced diffusion-based framework for controllable and flexible full-length song generation. DiffRhythm+ leverages a substantially expanded and balanced training dataset to mitigate issues such as repetition and omission of lyrics, while also fostering the emergence of richer musical skills and expressiveness. The framework introduces a multi-modal style conditioning strategy, enabling users to precisely specify musical styles through both descriptive text and reference audio, thereby significantly enhancing creative control and diversity. We further introduce direct performance optimization aligned with user preferences, guiding the model toward consistently preferred outputs across evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffRhythm+ achieves significant improvements in naturalness, arrangement complexity, and listener satisfaction over previous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Step-Audio 2, an end-to-end multi-modal large language model designed for industry-strength audio understanding and speech conversation. By integrating a latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric reinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate genuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the generation of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly enhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking styles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic knowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to mitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions of hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and expressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various audio understanding and conversational benchmarks compared to other open-source and commercial solutions.

      <title>Seed LiveInterpret 2.0: End-to-end Simultaneous Speech-to-speech Translation with Your Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) represents one of the most daunting frontiers in the translation industry, with product-level automatic systems long plagued by intractable challenges: subpar transcription and translation quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and translated speech inflation, especially in long-form discourses. In this study, we introduce Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, an end-to-end SI model that delivers high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning capabilities. As a fully operational product-level solution, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 tackles these challenges head-on through our novel duplex speech-to-speech understanding-generating framework. Experimental results demonstrate that through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning, the model achieves a significantly better balance between translation accuracy and latency, validated by human interpreters to exceed 70% correctness in complex scenarios. Notably, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 outperforms commercial SI solutions by significant margins in translation quality, while slashing the average latency of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to a near-real-time 3 seconds, which is around a near 70% reduction that drastically enhances practical usability.</description>
