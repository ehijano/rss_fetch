      <title>Plasma Discharge Undulator: a novel concept for plasma-based radiation sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma discharge devices have recently emerged as compact and versatile tools for particle beam manipulation. Building upon the Active Plasma Lens (APL) and its curved extension, the Active Plasma Bending (ABP), this work introduces the concept of the Plasma Discharge Undulator (PDU). In a PDU, a high-current discharge within a capillary generates an azimuthal magnetic field providing strong linear focusing ($O(1)$ (kT/m)), while a controlled and periodical spatial modulation of the discharge axis acts as a geometric driving term. The resulting beam dynamics can be modeled as a forced harmonic oscillator, yielding a well-defined oscillation at wavelength $\lambda_{\mathrm{PDU}}$, distinct from the natural betatron wavelength $\lambda_\beta$ related to APL focusing. Proper injection conditions result in the suppression of collective betatron oscillations, significantly reducing the intrinsic undulator strength spread typical of conventional plasma undulators, while allowing for matched beam transport thanks to APL strong focusing. Analytical models for particle trajectories and radiation emission are developed, and the one-dimensional requirements for free-electron laser (FEL) emission are evaluated, providing scaling relations and feasibility criteria for FEL operation in the proposed scheme. Theoretical estimates and multi-particle simulations indicate that the PDU can operate in the short-period regime ($\lambda_{\mathrm{PDU}} = $ mm-cm) with tunable undulator strength $K_{\mathrm{PDU}}$, supporting narrow-band radiation emission. The PDU thus provides a pathway toward miniaturized, tunable, fully-plasma-based light sources with enhanced control over focusing and spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Influence of bending parameters on crystalline undulator radiation peak stability for 530 MeV positron channelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of crystalline undulator radiation (CUR) peaks emitted by 530 MeV positron channelling in periodically bent C(110) crystals with varying bending amplitudes and bending periods. Relativistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed to quantify how these parameters affect the intensity and position of the CUR peak. The continuous potential approximation was used to identify isolines of constant peak energy, providing a reference for regions of spectral stability. MD results show that increasing the bending amplitude shifts the CUR peak to lower photon energies, while decreasing the period shifts it to higher energies, with both trends accompanied by enhanced dechannelling. For crystal parameters similar to recent experiments conducted at the MAinz MIkrotron (MAMI), the simulated CUR peak appears near 0.515 MeV. These results demonstrate that the CUR peak remains stable across a broad range of bending amplitudes and periods, establishing estimates of manufacturing tolerances for the design of gamma-ray crystal-based light sources.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal shaping of attosecond X-rays with time-dependent orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are indispensable for exploring ultrafast phenomena in matter on Angstrom and attosecond scales. Here we propose a new method to realize spatiotemporal shaping of attosecond X-rays through temporal control of the orbital angular momentum mode content using an X-ray free-electron laser. The method exploits transverse-mode-dependent frequency pulling in a deliberately detuned second stage, together with slippage between the seed and the amplified radiation. Three-dimensional simulations show a double-spike waveform in which the two spikes carry different dominant topological charges. The spike separation is tunable and can reach several hundred attoseconds. This provides a source-level route to spatiotemporally structured attosecond X-rays with controllable temporal structure and topological mode content.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Monochromatization interaction region optics design for direct s-channel Higgs production at FCC-ee"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original article [1] can be logically divided into two parts: 1) the selection of main parameters for monochromatization and 2) interaction region optics design; the comment pertains only to the first part. The authors of [1] state that "The purpose of this paper is to report on the development of realistic IR optics designs for monochromatization at the FCC-ee". However, the proposed parameters do not seem very realistic and raise many questions; due to space limitations, we will only consider the most important ones.</description>

      <title>Elaboration on the kinetic approach of Derbenev and Kondratenko to spin-polarized beams in electron storage rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed account of the kinetic approach for describing the effect of synchrotron radiation on electron and positron spin polarization in storage rings. This approach was introduced in 1974 by Derbenev and Kondratenko and was extended by us since 2001. The kinetic approach is much less frequently utilized but it is more general than the original non-kinetic approach of Derbenev and Kondratenko from 1972 since the kinetic approach is not centered on the invariant spin field. As with the non-kinetic approach the kinetic approach covers the radiative depolarization effect, the Sokolov-Ternov effect and its Baier-Katkov correction as well as the kinetic polarization effect but it enables the calculation of corrections to the original Derbenev-Kondratenko formulas and thereby provides estimates of the reliability of the latter. The kinetic appoach is applicable to storage rings with energies from a few GeV up to the energies of the FCC-ee and CEPC and beyond. The kinetic approach is based on the spin-orbit Wigner functions which lead to the so-called Bloch equation for the polarization density which is a generalization of Fokker-Planck equations to spin motion. In turn, as discovered in 2019, the Bloch equation is based on stochastic ordinary differential equations which can be used to develop Monte-Carlo spin-tracking codes covering the key effects beyond just radiative depolarization. These stochastic ordinary differential equations lead to a new viewpoint of the physical effects, in particular the kinetic polarization effect.</description>

      <title>Wakefield Acceleration in a Layered Plasma Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) represent one of the promising new accelerator concepts that are now being developed intensively for future applications in high-energy physics and industry. Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches. The 2.5D particle-in-cell code was used to simulate the witness acceleration of an electron bunch by a wakefield created by drive electron bunches in a two-layer plasma wakefield accelerator. The simulation showed good agreement with the results of analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Optimization of laser-driven proton acceleration in a near-critical-density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19341v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing laser and plasma parameters is crucial for enhancing accelerated proton energy in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. Tight focusing plays a significant role in improving laser-driven proton acceleration, which is generally believed as a result of the enhancement of laser intensity. However, we find that even at a fixed laser intensity, reducing the focal spot size still enhances the proton energy. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at a small spot size (0.8 {\mu}m), the maximum proton energy is enhanced by 56.3% compared to that obtained at a conventional spot size (3 {\mu}m). This improvement is attributed to the dominance of ponderomotive-force-driven electrons at reduced spot sizes, which generate stronger charge-separation fields that propagate at higher velocities. Furthermore, to optimize proton acceleration, we analytically derive an ideal plasma density profile that promotes phase-stable proton acceleration, yielding an additional energy increase of 61.3% over the case of a tightly focused laser interacting with a planar target of uniform density. These findings remain robust under parameter variations, indicating that advanced focusing techniques combined with optimized plasma profiles could relax the demand for high laser energies, thereby reducing the reliance on large-scale laser facilities in medical and scientific applications.</description>
