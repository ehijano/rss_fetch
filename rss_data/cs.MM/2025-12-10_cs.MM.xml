      <description>arXiv:2512.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyberbullying is a well-known social issue, and it is escalating day by day. Due to the vigorous development of the internet, social media provide many different ways for the user to express their opinions and exchange information. Cyberbullying occurs on social media using text messages, comments, sharing images and GIFs or stickers, and audio and video. Much research has been done to detect cyberbullying on textual data; some are available for images. Very few studies are available to detect cyberbullying on GIFs/stickers. We collect a GIF dataset from Twitter and Applied a deep learning model to detect cyberbullying from the dataset. Firstly, we extracted hashtags related to cyberbullying using Twitter. We used these hashtags to download GIF file using publicly available API GIPHY. We collected over 4100 GIFs including cyberbullying and non cyberbullying. we applied deep learning pre-trained model VGG16 for the detection of the cyberbullying. The deep learning model achieved the accuracy of 97%. Our work provides the GIF dataset for researchers working in this area.</description>

      <title>PAVAS: Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality and temporal synchronization, yet most models remain appearance-driven, capturing visual-acoustic correlations without considering the physical factors that shape real-world sounds. We present Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis (PAVAS), a method that incorporates physical reasoning into a latent diffusion-based V2A generation through the Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter). The adapter receives object-level physical parameters estimated by the Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to infer the moving-object mass and a segmentation-based dynamic 3D reconstruction module to recover its motion trajectory for velocity computation. These physical cues enable the model to synthesize sounds that reflect underlying physical factors. To assess physical realism, we curate VGG-Impact, a benchmark focusing on object-object interactions, and introduce Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC), an evaluation metric that measures consistency between physical and auditory attributes. Comprehensive experiments show that PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

      <title>Gamification with Purpose: What Learners Prefer to Motivate Their Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates learners' preferences for game design elements (GDEs) in educational contexts to inform the development of purpose-driven gamification strategies. It emphasizes a learner-centered approach that aligns gamification design with pedagogical goals, while mitigating risks such as the erosion of intrinsic motivation. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify ten widely discussed GDEs. Visual prototypes representing each element were developed, and a best-worst scaling (BWS) survey with 125 participants was administered to elicit preference rankings. Qualitative feedback was also collected to uncover motivational drivers. Learners consistently preferred GDEs that support learning processes directly-most notably progress bars, concept maps, immediate feedback, and achievements. Qualitative analysis revealed six recurring motivational themes, including visible progress, content relevance, and constructive feedback. The findings suggest that learners value gamification elements that are meaningfully integrated with educational content and support intrinsic motivation. Purpose-aligned gamification should prioritize tools that visualize learning progress and provide actionable feedback, rather than relying solely on extrinsic incentives.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Disentanglement with Projected Feature Alignment for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) significantly enhances emotion recognition performance by integrating complementary emotional cues from text, audio, and visual modalities. While existing methods commonly utilize techniques such as contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to align cross-modal emotional semantics, they typically overlook modality-specific emotional nuances like micro-expressions, tone variations, and sarcastic language. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orthogonal Disentanglement with Projected Feature Alignment (OD-PFA), a novel framework designed explicitly to capture both shared semantics and modality-specific emotional cues. Our approach first decouples unimodal features into shared and modality-specific components. An orthogonal disentanglement strategy (OD) enforces effective separation between these components, aided by a reconstruction loss to maintain critical emotional information from each modality. Additionally, a projected feature alignment strategy (PFA) maps shared features across modalities into a common latent space and applies a cross-modal consistency alignment loss to enhance semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations on widely-used benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed OD-PFA multimodal emotion recognition tasks, as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Cross-Space Synergy: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) aims to predict speakers' emotions by integrating textual, acoustic, and visual cues. Existing approaches either struggle to capture complex cross-modal interactions or experience gradient conflicts and unstable training when using deeper architectures. To address these issues, we propose Cross-Space Synergy (CSS), which couples a representation component with an optimization component. Synergistic Polynomial Fusion (SPF) serves the representation role, leveraging low-rank tensor factorization to efficiently capture high-order cross-modal interactions. Pareto Gradient Modulator (PGM) serves the optimization role, steering updates along Pareto-optimal directions across competing objectives to alleviate gradient conflicts and improve stability. Experiments show that CSS outperforms existing representative methods on IEMOCAP and MELD in both accuracy and training stability, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex multimodal scenarios.</description>

      <title>VoiceCloak: A Multi-Dimensional Defense Framework against Unauthorized Diffusion-based Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12332v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.</description>
