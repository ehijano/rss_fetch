      <title>Probing Electro-Magnetic Field Enhancement in 3D Plasmonic Nanopores Using DNA-PAINT and Nanorulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanopores combine nanofluidic confinement with electromagnetic field enhancement, enabling optical interrogation of single molecules in sub-wavelength volumes. Yet, direct optical readout within these metallic geometries has remained challenging due to fluorescence quenching near the surface. Here, we implement DNA-PAINT as a molecular reporter of local optical fields inside plasmonic nanopores. Transient hybridization of fluorescent imager strands at the nanopore tips yields stochastic emission bursts that map active binding sites with nanometric precision. By varying the fluorophore-metal distance using DNA spacers of controlled length, we observe a non-monotonic intensity response consistent with near-field quenching and plasmonic enhancement, identifying an optimal separation of around 6 nm. Finally, we extend the concept to dual-material Au/Si nanopores, demonstrating lateral coupling between plasmonic and semiconducting regions. These results establish DNA-PAINT as a quantitative probe of nanoscale optical environments in hybrid nanopores.</description>

      <title>Observation of gigantic orbital mixing conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report that due to the orbital Hall effect, orbital pumping effects can occur in materials with weak spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between the strength of the orbital Hall effect and the size of spin-pumping. During the spin-pumping, with the enhancement of the orbital Hall effect, the resonant absorption of orbital current and the damping of the ferromagnetic layer also increase. Especially, when the thickness of Ti reaches 60 nm, the orbital -mixing conductance of Ti/Co is an order of magnitude higher than spin-mixing conductance of heavy metal/Co, reaching 474.1 3 ^18 m^(-2). The results indicate that the orbital current is more easily transmitted across the interface</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Reversal of Thermal Anisotropy in Bi2O2Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bi2O2Se is an emerging semiconductor with intrinsically low thermal conductivity, making it a promising material for thermoelectric applications. Hydrostatic pressure can effectively tunes the thermal conductivity, with various pressure-dependent trends reported. However, its impact on thermal anisotropy, particularly in the highly anisotropic Bi2O2Se, remains poorly understood. Here, we report a pressure-driven reversal of thermal anisotropy: k_z &lt; k_x at 0 GPa transforms into k_z &gt; k_x at 60 GPa without phase transition. This stems from distinct phonon dispersions along the x- and z-directions under pressure, leading to a reshaped group velocity landscape. Below 10 meV, vz &gt; vx at both pressures, with a much greater advantage at 60 GPa. Above 10 meV, vx &gt; vz at 0 GPa; however, the difference nearly vanishes at 60 GPa. These changes result from anisotropic lattice compression, with the z-axis shrinking more significantly than the x-axis and suppressing the lone pair activity of Bi atoms. This study calls for revisiting the pressure dependence of thermal conductivity anisotropy and provides insights for pressure-driven thermal switching applications.</description>

      <title>3D printed waveguides for optogenetics applications: design optimization and optical characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$\mu$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.</description>

      <title>Material processing by laser-plasma-filament-guided high voltage discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate ablation experiments performed by laser-plasma-filament guided electrical discharges at high-voltages of up to 145 kV. The guiding was accomplished via fs-laser-generated plasma filaments across a gap of 201 mm of air onto steel 1.3343 samples. This method combines remote material processing and enables the steering and deflection of high voltage discharges with the ease-of-use of remote laser processing technology. We observe an increase of the per-pulse-(and-discharge)-ablated volume by a factor of 1.67 over an ablation regime when the discharges are not present and up to a factor of 12.5 over the case when neither discharges nor plasma filaments, only a loosely focused laser beam, are present.</description>

      <title>Variational phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture with flexibly tunable strength surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational phase-field models of brittle fracture are powerful tools for studying Griffith-type crack propagation in complex scenarios. However, as approximations of Griffith's theory-which does not incorporate a strength criterion-these models lack flexibility in prescribing material-specific strength surfaces. Consequently, they struggle to accurately capture crack nucleation under multiaxial stress conditions. In this paper, inspired by Alessi et al. (2014), we propose a variational phase-field model that approximates cohesive fracture. The model accommodates an arbitrary (convex) strength surface, independent of the regularization length scale, and allows for flexible tuning of the cohesive response. Our formulation results in sharp cohesive cracks and naturally enforces a sharp non-interpenetration condition, thereby eliminating the need for additional energy decomposition strategies. It inherently satisfies stress softening and produces "crack-like" residual stresses by construction. To ensure strain hardening, the ratio of the regularization length to the material's cohesive length must be sufficiently small; however, if crack nucleation is desired, this ratio must also be large enough to make the homogeneous damaged state unstable. We investigate the model in one and three dimensions, establishing first- and second-order stability results. The theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations using the finite element method, employing standard discretization and solution techniques.</description>

      <title>On the surface Bloch waves in truncated periodic media: scalar-wave primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much like their counterparts in homogenous elastic solids, waves in periodic media can be broadly classified into Floquet-Bloch body waves, and evanescent surface waves. Our goal is to elucidate the latter boundary layers, termed surface Bloch (SB) waves, affiliated with rational surface cuts and homogeneous Neumann data. To this end we adopt a two-dimensional (2D) scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients (describing anticline shear waves in phonoic crystals) as a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model of the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms, and ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a geometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice and orientation of the surface cut -- that seeks the complex wavenumber normal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber in the direction of the cut plane. In this way the sought boundary layer is derived via superposition of the evanescent QEP eigenstates, whose relative amplitudes are obtained by imposing the homogeneous boundary condition. With the QEP eigenspectrum at hand, evaluation of an SB wave -- in terms of both dispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms -- entails only a low-dimensional eigenvalue problem. This feature caters for rapid exploration of the effect of (periodic) surface undulations, and so enables manipulation of the SB waves via optimal design of the surface cut. Our analysis also includes an account for the power flow and ``skin depth'' of a surface Bloch wave, both of which are critical for the energetic relevance of boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Polarization-sensitive GeSn Mid-Infrared Membrane Photodetectors with Integrated Plasmonic Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Germanium-Tin (GeSn) semiconductors are promising for mid-infrared optoelectronics owing to their silicon compatibility, tunable bandgap, and potential for room-temperature operation. Released GeSn membranes provide an additional degree of freedom to extend the operation wavelength through epitaxial strain relaxation, while their transferability expands design flexibility. On the other hand, metasurfaces have become an effective strategy to engineer light--matter interaction, and their integration with photodetectors can enhance performance and introduce new functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a mid-infrared photodetector consisting of a transfer-printed Ge$_{0.89}$Sn$_{0.11}$ membrane integrated with an Au plasmonic metasurface. The photodetector exhibits a wavelength cutoff exceeding 3.0~$\mu$m with nearly fourfold increase in responsivity at 2.5~$\mu$m as compared to unreleased films, attributed to Fabry--P\'erot resonance. Furthermore, the integration with an anisotropic metasurface yields detectors with strong polarization sensitivity, achieving a measured contrast ratio of $\sim$4:1 between orthogonal polarizations. Moreover, the operation wavelength of the photodetector can be selectively tuned by varying the geometric scale of the metasurface. The experimental results show excellent agreement with simulations, confirming the effectiveness and versatility of this integrated metasurface--membrane design.</description>

      <title>Unified approach to power-efficiency trade-off relations of generic thermal machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for determining the power-efficiency trade-off relations across arbitrary thermal machines, addressing the lack of unified optimization results stemming from their diverse functionalities (e.g., heat engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps). For time-dependent cycle irreversibility $A(\tau)$ following a $\tau^{-\alpha}$ power law, where $\alpha$ is an interaction-dependent parameter, we show that engineering the interactions between thermal machines and reservoirs enables control over the trade-off relations, with the efficiency at maximum power approaching Carnot efficiency as $\alpha$ increases. Setting $\alpha=1$ naturally recovers typical low-dissipation regime results. Additionally, we derive the first power-efficiency trade-off for finite-time quantum adiabatic Otto machines with $\tau^{-2}$-scaling. This work establishes a unified constraint for thermodynamic cycles across non-equilibrium regimes, facilitating consistent optimization of diverse thermal devices in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many exotic thermodynamic processes that are hard to study in nature. Here, we synthesize a structured environment to explore the extremes of thermodynamics. We present an engine running at extreme temperatures of above ten Mega-Kelvin. Our underdamped engine is realised by electrically levitating and controlling a charged microparticle in vacuum. Giant fluctuations are observed in the engine's heat exchange with the environment, while its efficiency shows stochastic events where more work is performed by the engine than heat consumed. Moreover, the non-uniformity of the synthetic environment leads to the particle experiencing position dependent diffusion, a critical phenomenon in microscale biological processes. We theoretically account for the effects of multiplicative noise and find excellent agreement with the observed behavior.</description>
