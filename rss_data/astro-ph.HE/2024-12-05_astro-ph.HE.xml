      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Nonstandard Neutrino Properties in Collapsing Stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-messenger approach for probing nonstandard neutrino properties through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsing stellar cores and associated supernova explosions. We show that neutrino flavor conversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads to large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise relatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides a promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other BSM physics impacting PNS convection.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis Conditions in Outflows of White Dwarfs Collapsing to Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or merger-induced collapse (MIC) of white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems is an interesting path to neutron star (NS) and magnetar formation, alternative to stellar core collapse and NS mergers. Such events could add a population of compact remnants in globular clusters, they are expected to produce yet unidentified electromagnetic transients including gamma-ray and radio bursts, and to act as sources of trans-iron elements, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. Here we present the first long-term (&gt;5 s post bounce) hydrodynamical simulations in axi-symmetry (2D), using energy- and velocity-dependent three-flavor neutrino transport based on a two-moment scheme. Our set of six models includes initial WD configurations for different masses, central densities, rotation rates, and angular momentum profiles. Our simulations demonstrate that rotation plays a crucial role for the proto-neutron star (PNS) evolution and ejecta properties. We find early neutron-rich ejecta and an increasingly proton-rich neutrino-driven wind at later times in a non-rotating model, in agreement with electron-capture supernova models. In contrast to that and different from previous results, our rotating models eject proton-rich material initially and increasingly more neutron-rich matter as time advances, because an extended accretion torus forms around the PNS and feeds neutrino-driven bipolar outflows for many seconds. AIC and MIC events are thus potential sites of r-process element production, which may imply constraints on their occurrence rates. Finally, our simulations neglect the effects of triaxial deformation and magnetic fields, serving as a temporary benchmark for more comprehensive future studies.</description>

      <title>Commensal Transient Searches with MeerKAT in Gamma-Ray Burst and Supernova Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02832v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity and field of view of the MeerKAT radio telescope provides excellent opportunities for commensal transient searches. We carry out a commensal transient search in supernova and short gamma-ray burst fields using methodologies established in Chastain et al. (2023). We search for transients in MeerKAT L-band images with 30 minute integration times, finding 13 variable sources. We compare these sources to the VLASS and RACS survey data, and examine possible explanation for the variability. We find that 12 of these sources are consistent with variability due to interstellar scintillation. The remaining source could possibly have some intrinsic variability. We also split the MeerKAT L-band into an upper and lower half, and search for transients in images with an 8 second integration time. We find a source with a duration of 8 to 16 seconds that is highly polarized at the lowest frequencies. We conclude that this source may be consistent with a stellar flare. Finally, we calculate accurate upper and lower limits on the transient rate using transient simulations.</description>

      <title>A Lower Mass Estimate for PSR J0348+0432 Based on CHIME/Pulsar Precision Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binary pulsar J0348+0432 was previously shown to have a mass of approximately 2\,${\rm M_\odot}$, based on the combination of radial-velocity and model-dependent mass parameters derived from high-resolution optical spectroscopy of its white-dwarf companion. We present follow-up timing observations that combine archival observations with data acquired by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) pulsar instrument. We find that the inclusion of CHIME/Pulsar data yields an improved measurement of general-relativistic orbital decay in the system that falls within 1.2 $\sigma$ of the original values published by Antoniadis et al. (2013) while being roughly 6 times more precise due to the extended baseline. When we combine this new orbital evolution rate with the mass ratio determined from optical spectroscopy, we determine a pulsar mass of 1.806(37)\,${\rm M_\odot}$. For the first time for this pulsar, timing alone significantly constrains the pulsar mass. We explain why the new mass for the pulsar is $10\%$ lower and discuss how the mis-modeling of the initial observations of the white dwarf companion likely led to an inaccurate determination of the pulsar mass.</description>

      <title>Prospects for gamma-ray emission from magnetar regions in CTAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations have highlighted magnetars as significant sources of cosmic rays, particularly through their gamma-ray emissions. This study examines three magnetar regions - CXOU J171405.7-31031, Swift J1834-0846, and SGR 1806-20 - known for emitting detectable electromagnetic signals. We assess the detectability of these regions using the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) by conducting an ON/OFF spectral analysis and compare the expected results with existing observations. Our findings indicate that CTAO will detect gamma-ray emissions from these three magnetar regions with significantly reduced emission flux errors compared to current instruments. In special, the study shows that the CXOUJ1714-3810 and SwiftJ1834-0846 magnetar regions can be observed by the full southern and northern CTAO arrays in just five hours of observation, with mean significances above $10 \,\sigma$ and $30 \,\sigma$, respectively. This paper discusses the regions analyzed, presents key results, and concludes with insights drawn from the study.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectral and Timing Properties of the Black Hole Binary XTE J1859+226 and their Relation to Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compiled the X-ray and soft gamma-ray observations of the Galactic black hole binary XTE J1859+226 in the 1999--2000 outburst from RXTE, ASCA, BeppoSAX and CGRO. Throughout systematic spectral analysis using a two-component model consisting of a multi-temperature accretion disk plus a fraction of its flux convolved with an empirical Comptonized powerlaw component, we found that the innermost radius ($r_{\rm in}$) and temperature (Tin) of the disk are very variable with time in the rising phase of soft X-ray flux where Type-A/B/C low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were found. After this phase, $r_{\rm in}$ remains constant at around 60 km assuming a distance of 8 kpc and an inclination angle of 67$^{\circ}$, and Tin smoothly decays with time. The constant $r_{\rm in}$ suggests a presence of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), with $r_{\rm in}$ repeatedly moving closer and farther away from the ISCO in the rising phase. Both disk parameters are remarkably correlated with independently analyzed timing properties such as QPO frequency and rms variability. Type-A/B QPOs are seen only when $r_{\rm in}$ is close to the ISCO, while Type-C are seen when $r_{\rm in}$ is truncated and the frequency changes with a relation of $r^{-1.0}_{\rm in}$, supporting that Type-C QPOs occur at the inner edge of the truncated disk. Accurate determinations of the frequency--$r_{\rm in}$ relation for various objects should be a powerful tool to discriminate plausible Type-C QPO models. Furthermore, we suggest that jet ejection events may occur when $r_{\rm in}$ rapidly approaches to the ISCO, along with rapid changes of the disk flux, the rms variability and the hardness ratio. A rapid shrinkage of $r_{\rm in}$ down to the ISCO can be a useful index as a precursor of radio flares for triggering Target-of-Opportunity observations and would provide constraints on jet launching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Efficient reanalysis of events from GWTC-3 with RIFT and asimov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different waveform models can yield notably different conclusions about the properties of individual gravitational wave events. For instance, previous analyses using the SEOBNRv4PHM, IMRPhenomXPHM models, and NRSur7dq4 have led to varying results regarding event properties. This variability complicates the interpretation of the data and understanding of the astrophysical phenomena involved. There is an ongoing need to reassess candidate events with the best available interpretations and models. Current approaches lack efficiency or consistency, making it challenging to perform large-scale reanalyses with updated models or improved techniques. It is imperative that investigations into waveform systematics be reproducible. Frameworks like asimov can facilitate large-scale reanalyses with consistent settings and high-quality results, and can reliably show how different waveform models affect the interpretation of gravitational wave events. This, in combination with other provided tools, allow for reanalysis of several events from the GWTC-3 catalog. We include access to full analysis settings that facilitate public use of GWOSC data on the Open Science Grid, particularly those conducted with the IMRPhenomPv2, SEOBNRv4PHM, SEOBNRv5PHM, and NRSur7dq4 waveform models. Our parameter inference results find similar conclusions to previously published work: for several events, all models largely agree, but for a few exceptional events these models disagree substantially on the nature of the merging binary.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection: parameters in reconnection models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Works on the energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection attract more attentions in recent years. Discussions on this topic, however, are often based on many simplifications, such as assuming a circularly flowing bulk plasma and a fixed orientation angle. A significant gap remains between theoretical models and the magnetic reconnection occurring in real astrophysical scenarios. In our previous work, we investigated the influence of orientation angle on energy extraction and figured out the differences between the plunging and circularly flowing bulk plasma. We introduced the concept of covering factor to quantify the capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole. In this work, as an improvement, we extend our discussions by treating the parameters in reconnection models as free parameters, bringing the theoretical model closer to the situations in real astrophysical systems. We employ two reconnection models, in which the geometric index and the guide field fraction are respectively induced. We separately present the dependences of energy extraction on the geometric index and the guide field fraction. More importantly, we propose to define the averaged covering factor weighted by reconnection rate to quantify the overall capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole, under the assumption that the magnetic reconnection process occurs stochastically and randomly within the ergosphere.</description>

      <title>The FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey: VIII. 112 binary pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding pulsars in binaries are important for measurements of the masses of neutron stars, for tests of gravity theories, and for studies of star evolution. We are carrying out the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey (GPPS) by using the the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Here we present the Keplerian parameters for 112 newly discovered pulsars in the FAST GPPS survey, and obtain timing solutions for 27 pulsars. Companions of these pulsars are He white dwarfs, CO/ONe white dwarfs, neutron stars, main sequence stars and ultra light objects or even planets. Our observations uncover eclipses of 8 binary systems. The optical counterpart for the companion of PSR J1908+1036 is identified. The Post-Keplerian parameter \Dot{\omega} for the double neutron star systems PSR J0528+3529 and J1844-0128 have been determined, with which the total masses of the binary systems are determined.</description>

      <title>The FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot Survey: VII. Six millisecond pulsars in compact orbits with massive white dwarf companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary millisecond pulsars with a massive white dwarf (WD) companion are intermediate-mass binary pulsars (IMBPs). They are formed via the Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) evolution channel if they are in compact orbits with an orbital period of less than 1 day. They are fairly rare in the known pulsar population, only five such IMBPs have been discovered before, and one of them is in a globular cluster. Here we report six IMBPs in a compact orbit, PSRs J0416+5201, J0520+3722, J1919+1341, J1943+2210, J1947+2304 and J2023+2853, discovered during the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), doubling the number of such IMBPs due to the high survey sensitivity in the short survey time of 5 minutes. Follow-up timing observations show that they all have either a CO WD or an ONeMg WD companion with a mass greater than about 0.8~M$_\odot$ in a very circular orbit with an eccentricity in the order of $\lesssim10^{-5}$. PSR J0416+5201 should be an ONeMg WD companion with a remarkable minimum mass of 1.28 M$_\odot$. These massive white dwarf companions lead to a detectable Shapiro delay for PSRs J0416+5201, J0520+3722, J1943+2210, and J2023+2853, indicating that their orbits are highly inclined. From the measurement of the Shapiro delay, the pulsar mass of J1943+2210 was constrained to be 1.84$^{\,+0.11}_{-0.09}$~M$_\odot$, and that of PSR J2023+2853 to be 1.28$^{\,+0.06}_{-0.05}$~M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation in the Large Magellanic Cloud from multiple low-frequency radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed to be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of energetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{CR}} $. $\nu_{\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\alpha_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.</description>

      <title>Difficulties of two exploding white dwarfs to account for type Ia supernovae with bimodal nebular emission profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a simple dynamical scheme to simulate the ejecta of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) scenarios with two exploding white dwarfs (WDs) and find that the velocity distribution of the ejecta has difficulties accounting for bimodal emission line profiles with a large separation between the two emission peaks. The essence of the dynamical code is in including the fact that the ejecta does not leave the system instantaneously. We find that the final separation velocity between the centers of masses of the two WDs' ejecta is ~80% of the pre-explosion WDs' orbital velocity, i.e., we find separation velocities of 4200-5400 km/s for two WDs of masses M1=M2=0.94 Mo. The lower separation velocities we find challenge scenarios with two exploding WDs to explain bimodal emission line profiles with observed velocity separations of up to ~7000 km/s. Only the mass in the ejecta of one WD with an explosion velocity lower than the separation velocity contributes to one peak of the bimodal profile; this is the inner ejecta. We find the inner ejecta to be only &lt;15% of the ejecta mass in energetic explosions. Less energetic explosions yield higher inner mass but lower separation velocities. We encourage searching for alternative explanations of bimodal line profiles.</description>

      <title>X-ray study of WR 48-6: A possible colliding wind binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an investigation of the X-ray emission associated with the Wolf-Rayet star, WR 48-6, using observations from the XMM Newton and Chandra X-ray telescopes covering two epochs separated by eleven months. The X-ray spectrum of WR 48-6 is well explained by a two-temperature plasma model, with cool and hot plasma temperatures of $0.8_{-0.2}^{\,+0.1}$ and $2.86_{-0.66}^{\,+1.01}$ keV. No significant X-ray variability is observed during these two epochs of observations. However, an increase in the local hydrogen column density accompanied by a decrease in the intrinsic X-ray flux between two epochs of observations is seen. Additionally, the intrinsic X-ray luminosity is found to be more than $10^{33} \rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ during both epochs of observations. Based on the analysis presented, WR 48-6 is a promising colliding wind binary candidate with a possible companion of spectral type O5-O6.</description>

      <title>Revising the Spin and Kick Connection in Isolated Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of black hole (BH) spins remains one of the least understood aspects of BHs. Despite many uncertainties, it is commonly assumed that if BHs originated from isolated massive star binaries, their spins should be aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary system. This assumption stems from the notion that BHs inherit their spins from their progenitor stars. In this study, we relax this long-held viewpoint and explore various mechanisms that can spin up BHs before or during their formation. In addition to natal spins, we discuss physical processes that can spin BHs isotropically, parallel to natal kicks, and perpendicular to natal kicks. These different mechanisms leave behind distinct imprints on the observable distributions of spin magnitudes, spin-orbit misalignments and the effective inspiral spin of merging binaries. In particular, these mechanisms allow even the binaries originating in the field to exhibit precession and retrograde spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}&lt;0$). This broadens the parameter space allowed for isolated binary evolution into regimes which were previously thought to be exclusive to dynamically assembled binaries.</description>

      <title>Universal Constants and Energy Integral in Self-Organized Criticality Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence frequency distributions of fluxes (F) and fluences or energies (E) observed in astrophysical observations are found to be consistent with the predictions of the fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model, which predicts power law slopes with universal constants of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux and $\alpha_E=(5/3)\approx 1.67$ for the fluence. The energy integrated over the power law-like (size distribution) energy range is found to be finite for these power law slopes with $\alpha_E &lt; 2$, which refutes earlier claims of a divergent energy integral that has been postulated in the energy budget of solar and stellar nanoflare scenarios. The theoretial FD-SOC model approximates the microscopic cellular automaton models satisfactorily with the macroscopic scaling law of classical diffusion. The universal scaling laws predict the size distributions of numerous astrophysical phenomena, such as solar flares, stellar flares, coronal mass ejections (CME), auroras, blazars, galactic fast radio bursts (FRB), active galactic nuclei (AGN), gamma-ray bursts (GRB), soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGB), and black-hole systems (BH), while coherent solar radio bursts, random radio bursts, solar energetic partices (SEP), cosmic rays, and pulsar glitches require non-standard SOC models.</description>

      <title>Power of simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for probing AGN outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole accretion in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is coupled to the evolution of their host galaxies. Outflowing winds in AGN can play an important role in this evolution through the resulting feedback mechanism. Multi-wavelength spectroscopy is key for probing the intertwined physics of inflows and outflows in AGN. However, with the current spectrometers, crucial properties of the ionized outflows are poorly understood, such as their coupling to the accretion rate, their launching mechanism, and their kinetic power. In this paper we discuss the need for simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for tackling outstanding questions on these outflows in AGN. The instrumental requirements for achieving the scientific objectives are addressed. We demonstrate that these requirements would be facilitated by the proposed Arcus Probe mission concept. The multi-wavelength spectroscopy and timing by Arcus would enable us to establish the kinematics and ionization structure of the entire ionized outflow, extending from the vicinity of the accretion disk to the outskirts of the host galaxy. Arcus would provide key diagnostics on the origin, driving mechanism, and the energetics of the outflows, which are useful benchmarks for testing various theoretical models of outflows and understanding their impact in AGN.</description>

      <title>Testing the Universality of Self-Organized Criticality in Galactic, Extra-Galactic, and Black-Hole Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we are testing whether the power law slopes ($\alpha_F$, $\alpha_E$) of fluxes $(F)$, fluences or energies $(E)$ are universal in their size distributions, $N(F) \propto F^{-\alpha_F}$ and $N(E) \propto E^{-\alpha_E}$, in astrophysical observations of galactic, extragalactic, and black-hole systems. This is a test of fundamental importance for self-organized criticality (SOC) systems. The test decides whether (i) power laws are a natural consequence of the scale-freeness and inherent universality of SOC systems, or (ii) if they depend on more complex physical scaling laws. The former criterion allows quantitative predictions of the power law-like size distributions, while the later criterion requires individual physical modeling for each SOC variable and data set. Our statistical test, carried out with 61 published data sets, yields strong support for the former option, which implies that observed power laws can simply be derived from the scale-freeness and do not require specific physical models to understand their statistical distributions. The observations show a mean and standard deviation of $\alpha_F=1.78\pm0.29$ for SOC fluxes, and $\alpha_E=1.66\pm0.22$ for SOC fluences, and thus are consistent with the prediction of the fractal-diffusive SOC model, with $\alpha_F=1.80$ and $\alpha_E=1.67$.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the Shock Interaction as an Additional Power Source in the Nebular Spectra of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red supergiants may lose significant mass through steady winds and episodic eruptions in the final 100-1000 years before the core collapses, shaping their circumstellar environment. Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and distant circumstellar material (CSM) can generate shocks, which can energize the ejecta and serve as a key power source during the nebular phase of the SN. In the present work, we investigate the nebular spectrum of SN 2023ixf, observed one year post-explosion (at +363 d) with the recently commissioned WEAVE instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. This marks the first supernova spectrum captured with WEAVE. In this spectrum, H$\alpha$ exhibits a peculiar evolution, flanked by blueward and redward broad components centred at $\sim\pm 5650\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ from the rest velocity of H$\alpha$, which are seen for only a few SNe to date. These features indicate energy deposition from shocks generated by the interaction of ejecta with a CSM expelled nearly 350 $-$ 640 years pre-explosion. Comparisons of the +363 d spectrum with model spectra from the literature, that include varying shock powers, suggest a shock power of at least $\sim 5 \times 10 ^{40}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ at this epoch. Additionally, analysis of the [O I] doublet, along with other prominent emission lines, provides evidence for clumpiness, dust formation, and asymmetry within the ejecta and/or the surrounding CSM. These emission lines also helped to constrain the oxygen mass ($\approx0.19^{\scriptscriptstyle +0.08}_{\scriptscriptstyle -0.04} M_\odot$), He-core mass ($&lt;3 M_\odot$) and the zero-age main sequence mass ($\lesssim 12 M_\odot$) of the progenitor of SN 2023ixf. The comparison with other Type II SNe highlights SN 2023ixf's unique shock interaction signatures and evidence of dust formation, setting it apart in terms of evolution and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation in Strong Collisionless Shocks: The Crucial Role of Ion-to-Electron Scale Separation in Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various astrophysical environments. Its non-linear nature complicates analytical understanding and necessitate Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. This study examines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), to decrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial and three velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic, parallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We compare simulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realistic mass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low ($\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings show that the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermal energy dissipation. At high $\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to more efficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher momentum. At low $\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electron acceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron acceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heating and lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly more magnetic field amplification at low $\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, the electron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reduced ion heating and remains high at high $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electron heating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that the ion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magnetic field, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino slow flavor evolution. Homogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense neutrino gases can exhibit collective flavor instabilities, triggering large flavor conversions that are driven primarily by neutrino-neutrino refraction. One broadly distinguishes between fast instabilities that exist in the limit of vanishing neutrino masses, and slow ones, that require neutrino mass splittings. In a related series of papers, we have shown that fast instabilities result from the resonant growth of flavor waves, in the same way as turbulent electric fields in an unstable plasma. Here we extend this framework to slow instabilities, focusing on the simplest case of an infinitely homogeneous medium with axisymmetric neutrino distribution. The relevant length and time scales are defined by three parameters: the vacuum oscillation frequency $\omega_E=\delta m^2/2E$, the scale of neutrino-neutrino refraction energy $\mu=\sqrt{2}G_F(n_\nu+n_{\overline\nu})$, and the ratio between lepton and particle number $\epsilon=(n_\nu-n_{\overline\nu})/(n_\nu+n_{\overline\nu})$. We distinguish between two very different regimes: (i) For $\omega_E\ll \mu \epsilon^2$, instabilities occur at small spatial scales of order $(\mu\epsilon)^{-1}$ with a time scale of order $\epsilon \omega_E^{-1}$. This novel branch of slow instability arises from resonant interactions with neutrinos moving along the axis of symmetry. (ii) For $\mu \epsilon^2\ll \omega_E\ll \mu$, the instability is strongly non-resonant, with typical time and length scales of order $1/\sqrt{\omega_E \mu}$. Unstable modes interact with all neutrino directions at once, recovering the characteristic scaling of the traditional studies of slow instabilities. In the inner regions of supernovae and neutron-star mergers, the first regime may be more likely to appear, meaning that slow instabilities in this region may have an entirely different character than usually envisaged.</description>

      <title>Effects of Landau quantization on neutrino emission and absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some neutron stars known as magnetars possess very strong magnetic fields, with surface fields as large as $10^{15}\,\rm G$ and internal fields that are possibly stronger. Recent observations of the radio pulsar GLEAM-X J1627 suggest it may have a surface field as strong as $10^{16} \,\rm G$. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the energy levels of electrons and protons are quantized and the Direct Urca process allows neutron stars to cool rapidly, even at low density. For the case of magnetic fields $B \geq 10^{16}\,\rm G$, we find features in the emissivity due to energy quantization that are not captured by the frequently employed quasiclassical approximation where energy levels are treated as nearly continuous. Resonances can result in amplification of the neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a calculation that neglects quantization, particularly at low temperature. These effects are not important for the thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may be relevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific densities. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the Direct Urca rate in a strong magnetic field using the standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean field nuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical challenge the modified wavefunctions present and a new semi-analytic approximation. These tools are also applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong magnetic fields in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. We calculate the opacities for neutrinos capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities and temperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to capture processes of the lowest energy neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more due to suppression of electron Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and from the effect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the case of capture on protons.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the global structures of neutron stars within the framework of general relativity, treating the entire star as a quantum-degenerate system. Rather than relying on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, we solve the Einstein-Cartan (EC) field equations self-consistently, incorporating the energy-momentum tensor contributions from neutrons. Neutron wave functions are obtained by solving the Dirac equation in a curved spacetime with both torsion and curvature effects. Given that neutron stars contain about 10^57 particles, we adopt a scaled h-bar approach to efficiently describe the quantum state of highly degenerate system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NinjaSat is an X-ray CubeSat designed for agile, long-term continuous observations of bright X-ray sources, with the size of 6U ($100\times200\times300$ mm$^3$) and a mass of 8 kg. NinjaSat is capable of pointing at X-ray sources with an accuracy of less than $0^{\circ}\hspace{-1.0mm}.1$ (2$\sigma$ confidence level) with 3-axis attitude control. The satellite bus is a commercially available NanoAvionics M6P, equipped with two non-imaging gas X-ray detectors covering an energy range of 2-50 keV. A total effective area of 32 cm$^2$ at 6 keV is capable of observing X-ray sources with a flux of approximately 10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The arrival time of each photon can be tagged with a time resolution of 61 $\mu$s. The two radiation belt monitors continuously measure the fluxes of protons above 5 MeV and electrons above 200 keV trapped in the geomagnetic field, alerting the X-ray detectors when the flux exceeds a threshold. The NinjaSat project started in 2020. Fabrication of the scientific payloads was completed in August 2022, and satellite integration and tests were completed in July 2023. NinjaSat was launched into a Sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of about 530 km on 2023 November 11 by the SpaceX Transporter-9 mission. After about three months of satellite commissioning and payload verification, we observed the Crab Nebula on February 9, 2024, and successfully detected the 33.8262 ms pulsation from the neutron star. With this observation, NinjaSat met the minimum success criterion and stepped forward to scientific observations as initially planned. By the end of November 2024, we successfully observed 21 X-ray sources using NinjaSat. This achievement demonstrates that, with careful target selection, we can conduct scientific observations effectively using CubeSats, contributing to time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>Impact of nuclear masses on r-process nucleosynthesis: bulk properties versus shell effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decomposing theoretical nuclear mass predictions into a liquid-drop parametrization and local shell effects shows that r-process abundances are virtually insensitive to large variations of the masses which originate from nuclear bulk properties of the model, such as the symmetry energy. Therefore, experimental and theoretical studies of masses devoted to r-process applications, such as the nucleosynthesis in the ejecta of neutron star mergers, should focus on the physical origin of local changes in mass trends without necessarily providing highly accurate mass determinations of individual nuclei.</description>

      <title>Impact of hyperons on structural properties of neutron stars and hybrid stars within four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of hyperons and phase transition to quark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars within the four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EGB). We employ the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase to construct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) that are consistent with the astrophysical constraints. The presence of hyperons softens the EoS and with a phase transition, the EoS further softens, and the speed of sound squared drops to around 0.2 for the maximum mass configuration which lies in the pure quark phase. Adjusting the Gaussian-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ within its allowed range results in a decrease in the mass-radius relationship for negative $\alpha$, and an increase for positive $\alpha$. In addition, functions are fitted to the maximum mass and its associated radius as a function of constant $\alpha$ to observe its impact on these properties.</description>

      <title>Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter. However, their analysis requires substantial computational resources due to the challenges in Bayesian stochastic sampling. The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect BNS signals with significantly increased signal duration, detection rates, and signal strength, leading to a major computational burden in the 3G era. We demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compressions on the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inferences. Given that full Bayesian analysis is prohibitively time-intensive, we validate our model against (semi-)analytical predictions. Additionally, we estimate the computational demands of BNS signal analysis in the 3G era, showing that the machine learning methods will be crucial for future catalog-level analysis.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Thickness of the Galactic Halo through Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy Using the Spatial-Dependent-Propagation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.13498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial-dependent-propagation (SDP) model with a nearby source works well to reproduce the coevolving features of both cosmic-ray (CR)-nuclei spectra and anisotropy. However, it is well known that the Sun is actually deviating from the galactic disk. This will lead to a dominating anisotropy in the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk, which is discrepant with current observations. Thus, it is necessary to further investigate the effect of the solar offset on anisotropy. In this work, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the combined studies of the solar offset, nuclei spectra, and anisotropy have been performed based on the SDP model. As a result, to reproduce CR spectra and anisotropy, the thickness of the inner halo $ (Z_{IH})$ needs to increase linearly with the displacement of the Sun. We also know that the PeV anisotropy could be used to estimate the value of the diffusion coefficient, thus breaking the degeneracy between the diffusion coefficient and halo thickness. Therefore, it is a good approach to constrain the halo thickness. Moreover, the anisotropy in the PeV energy region, as a new probe, might also shed new light on constraining the solar offset. It is hoped that the anisotropy of the energies from $\rm \sim$TeV to $\rm PeV$ can be finely measured with the LHAASO experiment, leading to a better understanding of the thick halo.</description>

      <title>Environmental Dependence of Type Ia Supernovae in Low-Redshift Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of 102 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in nearby (z &lt; 0.1), x-ray selected galaxy clusters. This is the largest such sample to date and is based on archival data primarily from ZTF and ATLAS. We divide our SNe Ia into an inner cluster sample projected within $r_{500}$ of the cluster center and an outer cluster sample projected between $r_{500}$ and $2\,r_{500}$. We compare these to field samples of SNe Ia at similar redshifts in both quiescent and star-forming host galaxies. Based on SALT3 fits to the light curves, we find that the inner cluster SNe Ia have a higher fraction of fast-evolving objects (SALT3 $x_1 &lt; -1$) than the outer cluster or field quiescent samples. This implies an intrinsically different population of SNe Ia occurs in inner cluster environments, beyond known correlations based on host galaxy alone. Our cluster samples show a strongly bimodal $x_1$ distribution with a fast-evolving component that dominates the inner cluster objects ($\gtrsim$ 75%) but is just a small fraction of SNe Ia in field star-forming galaxies ($\lesssim$ 10%). We do not see strong evidence for variations in the color (SALT3 $c$) distributions among the samples and find only minor differences in SN Ia standardization parameters and Hubble residuals. We suggest that the age of the stellar population drives the observed distributions, with the oldest populations nearly exclusively producing fast-evolving SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric signal separation in very-high-energy gamma ray observations with probabilistic neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An intriguing challenge in observational astronomy is the separation signals in areas where multiple signals intersect. A typical instance of this in very-high-energy (VHE, E$\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray astronomy is the issue of residual background in observations. This background arises when cosmic-ray protons are mistakenly identified as gamma-rays from sources of interest, thereby blending with signals from astrophysical sources of interest. We introduce a deep ensemble approach to determine a non-parametric estimation of source and background signals in VHE gamma observations, as well as a likelihood-derived epistemic uncertainty on these estimations. We rely on minimal assumptions, exploiting the separability of space and energy components in the signals, and defining a small region in coordinate space where the source signal is assumed to be negligible compared to background signal. The model is applied both on mock observations, including a simple toy case and a realistic simulation of dark matter annihilation in the Galactic center, as well as true observations from the public H.E.S.S. data release, specifically datasets of the Crab nebula and the pulsar wind nebula MSH 15-52. Our method performs well in mock cases, where the ground truth is known, and compares favorably against conventional physical analysis approaches when applied to true observations. In the case of the mock dark matter signal in the Galactic center, our work opens new avenues for component separation in this complex region of the VHE sky.</description>

      <title>Crab Pulsar: IXPE Observations Reveal Unified Polarization Properties Across Optical and Soft X-Ray Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a phase-dependent analysis of the polarized emission from the Crab pulsar based on three sets of observations by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We found that a phenomenological model involving a simple linear transformation of the Stokes parameters adequately describes the IXPE data. This model enables us to establish, for the first time, a connection between the polarization properties of the Crab pulsar in the optical and soft X-ray bands, suggesting a common underlying emission mechanism across these bands, likely synchrotron radiation. In particular, the phase-dependent polarization degree in X-rays for pure pulsar emission shows similar features but is reduced by a factor $\approx (0.46-0.56)$ compared to the optical band (accounting for the contribution of the Knot in the optical), implying an energy-dependent polarized emission. In addition, using this model, we study the polarization angle swing in X-rays and identify a potentially variable phase-shift at the interpulse relative to the optical band, alongside a phase-shift marginally consistent with zero persisting at the main pulse. While the origin of this variability is unknown and presents a new challenge for theoretical interpretation, our findings suggest that the emission mechanism for the main pulse is likely located far from the neutron star surface, perhaps near or beyond the light cylinder, rather than operating in the inner magnetosphere where vacuum birefringence is expected to be at work. Ignoring the phase-shifts would result in identical phase-dependent polarization angles between the optical and X-ray bands for pure pulsar emission.</description>

      <title>Fate of the remnant in tidal stripping event: repeating and non-repeating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDE) occur when a star ventures too close to a massive black hole. In a partial TDE (pTDE), the star only grazes the tidal radius, causing the outer envelope of the star to be stripped away while the stellar core survives. Previous research has shown that a star, once tidally stripped in a parabolic orbit, can acquire enough orbital energy for its remnant to become a high-velocity star potentially capable of escaping the galaxy. Conversely, some studies have reported that the remnant may lose orbital energy and undergo re-disruption, leading to a recurring pTDE. This study aims to uncover the physical mechanisms and determine the conditions that lead to these divergent outcomes. We find that the orbital energy change only depends on the impact factor and the stellar structure, and barely depends on the mass of the black hole or the exact mass or orbital eccentricity of the star. For a $\gamma=5/3$ (or $\gamma=4/3$) polytropic star, after a pTDE its remnant gains orbital energy when the impact factor $\beta \gtrsim 0.62$ (or $\gtrsim 1.1$) or loses energy vice versa. Additionally, we verify an analytical equation for orbital energy change that is applicable across various systems. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we also explore the structure of the stellar remnant post-tidal stripping. Our findings provide critical insights for interpreting observed pTDEs and advancing knowledge on the orbital evolution and event rate of these events.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Field on the Formation of Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow around Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of magnetic field in the formation of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) in the presence of Bremsstrahlung cooling, which facilitates the formation of a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk surrounded by a hot corona. We have performed axis-symmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of an initial accretion torus with a $1/r$ dependant local poloidal field in the presence of a pseudo-Newtonian potential, taking into account optically thin cooling, resistivity and viscosity. We observe the formation of persistent jets and magnetised outflows from the corona surrounding a thin disk with an increase in the magnetic diffusivity parameter. We have defined an equivalent time scale ($\tau_{eq}$) which takes into account the heating time scales due to viscosity, resistivity, magnetic reconnection and magneto-rotational instability turbulence such that the thin disk is formed if the cooling time scale ($\tau_{cool}$) is lower than this equivalent time scale ($\tau_{cool}/\tau_{eq}&lt;1$). Using this condition, for the first time, we found that the thin disk exists when the initial ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure (plasma beta) exceeds a range of $600-800$ for the gas obeying a polytropic equation of state accreting at $10^{-5}\ M_{\odot}/year$</description>

      <title>Modified Characteristics of Hadronic Interactions in Ultra-high-energy Cosmic-ray Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data from multiple experiments suggest that the current interaction models used in Monte Carlo simulations do not correctly reproduce the hadronic interactions in air showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR), in particular - but not limited to - the production of muons during the showers. We have created a large library of UHECR simulations where the interactions at the highest energies are slightly modified in various ways - but always within the constraints of the accelerator data, without any abrupt changes with energy and without assuming any specific mechanism or dramatically new physics at the ultra-high energies. We find that even when very different properties - cross-section, elasticity and multiplicity - of the interactions are modified, the resulting changes in some air-shower observables are still mutually correlated. Thus not all possible combinations of changes of observables are easily reproduced by some combination of the modifications. Most prominently, the recent results of the Pierre Auger Observatory, which call for a change in the prediction of both the muon content at ground and the depth of the maximum of longitudinal development of the showers, are rather difficult to reproduce with such modifications, in particular when taking into account other cosmic-ray data. While some of these results are related to the assumptions we place on the modifications, the overall lessons are general and provide valuable insight into how the UHECR data can be interpreted from the point of view of hadronic physics.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy hadronic physics at the Pierre Auger Observatory: muon measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR), offers a unique insight into the properties of hadronic interactions occurring in air showers at energies well above those reached at human-made accelerators. The key probe into the hadronic interactions has, for a long time, been the number of muons arriving at the ground, which can be directly measured at Auger for energies up to 10 EeV using dedicated underground muon detectors or estimated through the observation of highly inclined showers using the surface detector of the Observatory. Further information can be obtained using the hybrid character of the Observatory, which allows the simultaneous observation of the longitudinal development of the shower with the fluorescence (and lately also radio) detector and the ground signal with the surface detector. Several different analyses using hybrid data show a discrepancy between the predictions of simulations based on the latest hadronic interaction models and data. This discrepancy has been long interpreted as a deficit in the number of muons predicted by the simulations with respect to the data. A new analysis using a global fit of the data on selected hybrid showers has shown that the disagreement between models and data is more complex and also involves the predictions for the depths of the maxima of the longitudinal shower development. At the same time, measurements of shower-to-shower fluctuations using inclined hybrid events show good agreement with the predictions, suggesting that the observed muon discrepancy is rather the result of a gradual accumulation of small changes during the shower development than of a major change in the properties of the first interaction. Recently, the Observatory has undergone an upgrade, which includes several components aimed at a significant improvement ...</description>

Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) is the most sensitive telescope at the L-band (1.0-1.5GHz) and has been used to carry out the FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey in the last 5 years. Up to now, the survey has covered one-fourth of the planned areas within $\pm10^\circ$ from the Galactic plane visible by the FAST, and discovered 751 pulsars. After the first publishing of the discovery of 201 pulsars and one rotating radio transient (RRAT) in 2021 and 76 RRATs in 2023, here we report the discovery of 473 new pulsars from the FAST GPPS survey, including 137 new millisecond pulsars and 30 new RRATs. We find that 34 millisecond pulsars discovered by the GPPS survey which can be timed with a precision better than 3 $\mu$s by using FAST 15-minute observations and can be used for the pulsar timing arrays. The GPPS survey has discovered 8 pulsars with periods greater than 10 s including one with 29.77 s. The integrated profiles of pulsars and individual pulses of RRATs are presented. During the FAST GPPS survey, we also detected previously known pulsars and updated parameters for 52 pulsars. In addition, we discovered 2 fast radio bursts plus one probable case with high dispersion measures indicating their extragalactic origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first, direct measurement of the electron density turbulence parameter $C_1$, enabled by 550-750 MHz observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The parameter $C_1$ depends on the power law index of the wavenumber spectrum of electron density inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium. Radio waves propagating through the inhomogeneous ionized medium suffer multipath propagation, as a result of which the pulsed emission from a neutron star undergoes scatter broadening. Consequently, interference between the delayed copies of the scatter-broadened electric field manifests as scintillation. We measure a scintillation bandwidth $\Delta\nu_d=149\pm3$ Hz as well as a scatter-broadening timescale $\tau_d=1.22\pm0.09$ ms at 650 MHz towards the magnetar XTE J1810-197, using which we estimate $C_1=1.14\pm0.09$ directly from the uncertainty relation. This is also the first reported direct measurement of a scintillation bandwidth of order 100 Hz. We describe the methods employed to obtain these results and discuss their implications in general, as well as for the magnetar XTE J1810-197. We also discuss how such, effectively in-situ, measurements of $C_1$ can aid in inferring the wavenumber spectrum power law index and hence quantitatively discriminate between the various possible scattering scenarios in the ionized medium.</description>

      <title>Testing mirror symmetry in the Universe with LIGO-Virgo black-hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain precessing black-hole mergers produce gravitational waves with net circular polarization, understood as an imbalance between right- and left-handed amplitudes. According to the Cosmological Principle, such emission must average to zero across all binary mergers in our Universe to preserve mirror-reflection symmetry at very large scales. We present a new independent gravitational-wave test of this hypothesis. Using a novel observable based on the Chern-Pontryagin pseudo-scalar, we measure the emission of net circular polarization across 47 black-hole mergers recently analyzed by Islam et. al. with a state-of-the art model for precessing black-hole mergers in General Relativity. The average value obtained is consistent with zero. Remarkably, however, we find that at least $82\%$ of the analysed sources must have produced net circular polarization. Of these, GW200129 shows strong evidence for mirror asymmetry, with a Bayes Factor of 12.6 or, equivalently, $93.1\%$ probability. We obtain consistent (although stronger) results of $97.5\%$ and $94.3\%$ respectively using public results on this event from Hannam et. al. and performing our own parameter inference. This finding further implies evidence of astrophysical sources that can spontaneously emit circularly polarized photons by quantum effects. Forthcoming black-hole merger detections will enable stronger constraints on large-scale mirror asymmetry and the Cosmological Principle.</description>

      <title>Effect of Deviations from General Relativity on Searches for Gravitational Wave Microlensing and Type II Strong Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the gravitational wave detector network is upgraded and the sensitivity of the detectors improves, novel scientific avenues open for exploration. For example, tests of general relativity will become more accurate as smaller deviations can be probed. Additionally, the detection of lensed gravitational waves becomes more likely. However, these new avenues could also interact with each other, and a gravitational wave event presenting deviations from general relativity could be mistaken for a lensed one. Here, we explore how phenomenological deviations from general relativity or binaries of exotic compact objects could impact those lensing searches focusing on a single event. We consider strong lensing, millilensing, and microlensing and find that certain phenomenological deviations from general relativity may be mistaken for all of these types of lensing. Therefore, our study shows that future candidate lensing events would need to be carefully examined to avoid a false claim of lensing where instead a deviation from general relativity has been seen.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent nuclear energy-density functional theory toolkit for neutron star crust: Dynamics of a nucleus in a neutron superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new numerical tool designed to probe the dense layers of neutron star crusts. It is based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with generalized Skyrme nuclear energy-density functionals of the Brussels-Montreal family. We use it to study the time evolution of a nucleus accelerating through superfluid neutron medium in the inner crust of a neutron star. We extract an effective mass in the low velocity limit. We observe a threshold velocity and specify mechanisms of dissipation: phonon emission, Cooper pairs breaking, and vortex rings creation. These microscopic effects are of key importance for understanding various neutron star phenomena. Moreover, the mechanisms we describe are general and apply also to other fermionic superfluids interacting with obstacles like liquid helium or ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Next-generation global gravitational-wave detector network: Impact of detector orientation on compact binary coalescence and stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.</description>

      <title>Minimum Entropy Indicator for Evaluating Dispersion Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advanced radio telescopes such as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) can provide high-sensitivity and high-time-resolution data of a large number of radio sources, offering an excellent opportunity for studying radio pulse profiles. However, studying pulse profiles necessitates addressing dispersion measurement (DM). The fitting method tends to make the profile conform to the model, so the fitting method is not suitable for pulse profile research. Indicators are needed to determine the profile that is closest to the real one, which is the profile discrimination method. This work is based on the definition of Shannon's information entropy, and believes that the pulse profile when the entropy is minimized is the closest to the true profile. This indicator is simple to calculate and can provide assistance for pulse profile research. This work uses real data from 48 pulsars. By calculating the information entropy of pulsar profiles under different DMs, the DM corresponding to the minimum entropy is found, thus verifying the validity of the minimum entropy indicator. In terms of the analysis results for the 48 pulsars, the differences with the references are less than 0.5% for all except 3 stars, and the results for these 3 stars are consistent with older references. The minimum entropy indicator can effectively obtain the DMs of radio pulse signals with low computational complexity, but it cannot be proven to be the optimal criterion. It is suggested to use multiple indicators separately when studying pulse profiles. It can be envisaged that the optimal indicator can provide insights into the radiation mechanism of radio sources.</description>

      <title>Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (up to ~130 parsecs across) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>A gravitational wave detectable candidate Type Ia supernova progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.</description>
