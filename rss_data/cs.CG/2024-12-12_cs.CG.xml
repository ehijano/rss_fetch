      <title>Computing Oriented Spanners and their Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a point set $P$ in a metric space and a real number $t \geq 1$, an \emph{oriented $t$-spanner} is an oriented graph $\overrightarrow{G}=(P,\overrightarrow{E})$, where for every pair of distinct points $p$ and $q$ in $P$, the shortest oriented closed walk in $\overrightarrow{G}$ that contains $p$ and $q$ is at most a factor $t$ longer than the perimeter of the smallest triangle in $P$ containing $p$ and $q$. The \emph{oriented dilation} of a graph $\overrightarrow{G}$ is the minimum $t$ for which $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an oriented $t$-spanner.
  We present the first algorithm that computes, in Euclidean space, a sparse oriented spanner whose oriented dilation is bounded by a constant. More specifically, for any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is a constant, we construct an oriented $(2+\varepsilon)$-spanner with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ edges in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space. Our construction uses the well-separated pair decomposition and an algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the minimum-perimeter triangle in $P$ containing two given query points in $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ time.
  While our algorithm is based on first computing a suitable undirected graph and then orienting it, we show that, in general, computing the orientation of an undirected graph that minimises its oriented dilation is NP-hard, even for point sets in the Euclidean plane.
  We further prove that even if the orientation is already given, computing the oriented dilation is APSP-hard for points in a general metric space. We complement this result with an algorithm that approximates the oriented dilation of a given graph in subcubic time for point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is a constant.</description>

      <title>Geometry helps in routing scalability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) aims to address a myriad of significant networking challenges that appear in time-varying settings, such as mobile and satellite networks, wherein changes in network topology are frequent and often subject to environmental constraints. Within this paradigm, routing problems are often solved by extending classical graph-theoretic path finding algorithms, such as the Bellman-Ford or Floyd-Warshall algorithms, to the time-varying setting; such extensions are simple to understand, but they have strict optimality criteria and can exhibit non-polynomial scaling. Acknowledging this, we study time-varying shortest path problems on metric graphs whose vertices are traced by semi-algebraic curves. As an exemplary application, we establish a polynomial upper bound on the number of topological critical events encountered by a set of $n$ satellites moving along elliptic curves in low Earth orbit (per orbital period). Experimental evaluations on networks derived from STARLINK satellite TLE's demonstrate that not only does this geometric framework allow for routing schemes between satellites requiring recomputation an order of magnitude less than graph-based methods, but it also demonstrates metric spanner properties exist in metric graphs derived from real-world data, opening the door for broader applications of geometric DTN routing.</description>

      <title>Time-optimal persistent homology representatives for univariate time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main methods used in Topological Data Analysis. An active area of research in the field is the study of appropriate notions of PH representatives, which allow to interpret the meaning of the information provided by PH, making it an important problem in the application of PH, and in the study of its interpretability. Computing optimal PH representatives is a problem that is known to be NP-hard, and one is therefore interested in developing context-specific optimality notions that are computable in practice. Here we introduce time-optimal PH representatives for time-varying data, allowing one to extract representatives that are close in time in an appropriate sense. We illustrate our methods on quasi-periodic synthetic time series, as well as time series arising from climate models, and we show that our methods provide optimal PH representatives that are better suited for these types of problems than existing optimality notions, such as length-optimal PH representatives.</description>

      <title>Efficient search of a minimum tree on points in a space with the $l_1$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the minimum spanning tree problem (for short, MSTP) on an arbitrary set of $n$ points of $d$-dimensional space in $l_1$-norm. For this problem, for each fixed $d\geq 2$, there is a known algorithm of the computational complexity $O\big(n\cdot (\log\,n + \log^{r_d}\,n\cdot \log\log\,n)\ big)$, where $r_d\in \{0,1,2,4\}$ for $d\in \{2,3,4,5\}$ and $r_d=d$ for $d\geq 6$. For $d=3$, this result can be improved to the computational complexity $O(n\cdot \log\,n)$. In this paper, for any fixed $d\geq 2$, an algorithm with the computational complexity $O(n\cdot \log^{d-1}\,n)$ is proposed to solve the considered MSTP, which improves the previous achievement for $d\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Recursive Computation of Path Homology for Stratified Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stratified digraphs are popular models for feedforward neural networks. However, computation of their path homologies has been limited to low dimensions due to high computational complexity. A recursive algorithm is proposed to compute certain high-dimensional (reduced) path homologies of stratified digraphs. By recursion on matrix representations of homologies of subgraphs, the algorithm efficiently computes the full-depth path homology of a stratified digraph, i.e. homology with dimension equal to the depth of the graph. The algorithm can be used to compute full-depth persistent homologies and for acyclic digraphs, the maximal path homology, i.e., path homology with dimension equal to the maximum path length of a graph. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm has a significant advantage over the general algorithm in computation time as the depth of stratified digraph increases.</description>
