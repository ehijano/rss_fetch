      <title>Empirical Models of the Time Evolution of SPX Option Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key objective of this paper is to develop an empirical model for pricing SPX options that can be simulated over future paths of the SPX. To accomplish this, we formulate and rigorously evaluate several statistical models, including neural network, random forest, and linear regression. These models use the observed characteristics of the options as inputs -- their price, moneyness and time-to-maturity, as well as a small set of external inputs, such as the SPX and its past history, dividend yield, and the risk-free rate. Model evaluation is performed on historical options data, spanning 30 years of daily observations. Significant effort is given to understanding the data and ensuring explainability for the neural network. A neural network model with two hidden layers and four neurons per layer, trained with minimal hyperparameter tuning, performs well against the theoretical Black-Scholes-Merton model for European options, as well as two other empirical models based on the random forest and the linear regression. It delivers arbitrage-free option prices without requiring these conditions to be imposed.</description>

      <title>American options valuation in time-dependent jump-diffusion models via integral equations and characteristic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in machine learning for derivative pricing, the efficient and accurate valuation of American options remains a persistent challenge due to complex exercise boundaries, near-expiry behavior, and intricate contractual features. This paper extends a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models, including pure diffusions, jump-diffusions, and Levy processes. Building on prior work, we derive and solve Volterra integral equations of the second kind to determine the exercise boundary explicitly, offering a computationally superior alternative to traditional finite-difference and Monte Carlo methods. We address key open problems: (1) extending the decomposition method, i.e. splitting the American option price into its European counterpart and an early exercise premium, to general jump-diffusion and Levy models; (2) handling cases where closed-form transition densities are unavailable by leveraging characteristic functions via, e.g., the COS method; and (3) generalizing the framework to multidimensional diffusions. Numerical examples demonstrate the method's efficiency and robustness. Our results underscore the advantages of the integral equation approach for large-scale industrial applications, while resolving some limitations of existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Portfolio Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investor, who holds his portfolio and doesn't trade his shares, at current time can use the time series of the market trades that were made during the averaging interval with the securities of his portfolio to assess the current variance of the portfolio. We show how the time series of trades with the securities of the portfolio determine the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of portfolio trades determine the return and variance of the portfolio in the same form as the time series of trades with securities determine their returns and variances. The description of any portfolio and any single market security is equal. The time series of portfolio trades define the decomposition of the portfolio variance by its securities. If the volumes of trades with all securities are assumed constant, the decomposition of the portfolio variance coincides with Markowitz's (1952) expression of variance. However, the real markets expose random volumes of trades. The portfolio variance that accounts for the randomness of trade volumes is a polynomial of the 4th degree in the variables of relative amounts invested into securities and with the coefficients different from covariances of securities returns. We discuss the possible origin of the latent and unintended assumption that Markowitz (1952) made to derive his result. Our description of the portfolio variance that accounts for the randomness of real trade volumes could help the portfolio managers and the majors like BlackRock's Aladdin and Asimov, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed to adjust their models and forecasts to the reality of random markets.</description>
