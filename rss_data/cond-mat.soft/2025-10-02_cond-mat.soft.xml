      <title>Template-free precision synthesis of biphilic microdome arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biphilic microdome arrays are ubiquitous in nature, but their synthetic counterparts have been scarce. To bridge that gap, we leverage condensed droplet polymerization (CDP) to enable their template-free synthesis. During CDP, monomer droplets serve as microreactors for free-radical polymerization. The droplet diameter is monitored in real time. To enable the precise prediction of the convex geometric parameters, we develop a theoretical framework that integrates geometric arguments, scaling analysis, and kinetic theories. The model accurately predicts the dimensions of the as-synthesized microdome arrays, pointing to unprecedented precision in the synthesis of such topography. To illustrate its impact, the methodology is used to enable biphilic microdomes with targeted dimensions, for the reduction of surface colonization by a biofilm-forming pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Importantly, the reduction is achieved with a moderately hydrophobic surface that has been considered prone to fouling, pointing to a fresh material design strategy and broadened palette of synthetic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Active particles in tunable crowded environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active particles affect their environment as much as the environment affects their active motion. Here, we present an experimental system where both can be simultaneously adjusted in situ using an external AC electric field. The environment consists in a two-dimensional bath of colloidal silica particles, whereas the active particles are gold-coated Janus spheres. As the electric field orthogonal to the planar layer increases, the former become stiffer and the latter become faster. The active motion evolves from a viscous like to a viscoelastic like behavior, with the reorientation frequency increasing with the particle speed. This effect culminates in the spontaneous chiralization of particle trajectories. We demonstrate that self-sustained reorientations arise from local compressions and interaction asymmetries, revealing a general particle-level mechanism where changes in the mechanical properties of the environment reshape active trajectories.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion and antidiffusion in an aligned active suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show theoretically that an imposed uniaxial anisotropy leads to new universality classes for the dynamics of active particles suspended in a viscous fluid. In the homogeneous state, their concentration relaxes superdiffusively, stirred by the long-ranged flows generated by its own fluctuations, as confirmed by our numerical simulations. Increasing activity leads to an anisotropic diffusive instability, driven by an active contribution to the particle current proportional to the local curvature of the suspension velocity profile.</description>

      <title>Advection selects pattern in multi-stable emulsions of active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the size of droplets, for example in biological cells, is challenging because large droplets typically outcompete smaller droplets due to surface tension. This coarsening is generally accelerated by hydrodynamic effects, but active chemical reactions can suppress it. We show that the interplay of these processes leads to three different dynamical regimes: (i) Advection dominates the coalescence of small droplets, (ii) diffusion leads to Ostwald ripening for intermediate sizes, and (iii) reactions finally suppress coarsening. Interestingly, a range of final droplet sizes is stable, of which one is selected depending on initial conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects control initial droplet sizes, but they do not affect the later dynamics, in contrast to passive emulsions.</description>

      <title>Optimal area exploration by resetting active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying optimal strategies for efficient spatial exploration is crucial, both for animals seeking food and for robotic search processes, where maximizing the covered area is a fundamental requirement. Here, we propose position resetting as an optimal protocol to enhance spatial exploration in active matter systems. Specifically, we show that the area covered by an active Brownian particle exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the resetting rate, demonstrating that resetting can optimize spatial exploration. Our results are based on experiments with active granular particles undergoing Poissonian resetting and are supported by active Brownian dynamics simulations. The covered area is analytically predicted at both large and small resetting rates, resulting in a scaling relation between the optimal resetting rate and the self-propulsion speed.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Design of Floppy Modes and Frustrated Loops in Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metamaterials are a promising platform for a range of applications, from shock absorption to mechanical computing. These functionalities typically rely on floppy modes or mechanically frustrated loops, both of which are difficult to design. In particular, how to design multiple modes or loops with target deformations remains an open problem. We introduce a combinatorial approach that allows us to create an arbitrarily large number of floppy modes and frustrated loops. The design freedom of the mode shapes enables us to easily introduce kinematic incompatibility to turn them into frustrated loops. We demonstrate that floppy modes can be sequentially buckled by using a specific instance of elastoplastic buckling. We utilize our combinatorial floppy chains and frustrated loops to achieve matrix-vector multiplication in materia. Our findings bring about new principles for the design and the use of floppiness and geometric frustration in soft matter and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Reentrant transition to collective actuation in active solids with a polarizing field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective actuation in active solids - the spontaneous coherent excitation of a few vibrational modes - emerges from a feedback between structural deformations and the orientation of active forces. It is an excellent candidate as a basic mechanism for oscillatory dynamics and regulation in dense living systems, and a better control over its onset would open new avenues in the life sciences. Combining model experiments, simulations and theory, we study the dynamics of such an active solid in the presence of an external field that polarizes the active forces. The experiments reveal a novel oscillatory regime absent at zero field. The theoretical analysis of a single agent demonstrates that the small field oscillations and the large field ones can be mapped onto the bounded and unbounded phase dynamics of a nonlinear pendulum. In the many agents case, the transition to collective actuation is promoted at low field, leading to a reentrant transition.</description>

      <title>Collective actuation in active solids in the presence of a polarizing field: a systematic analysis of the dynamical regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective actuation in active solids, the spontaneous condensation of the dynamics on a few elastic modes, takes place whenever the deformations of the structure reorient the forces exerted by the active units composing, or embedded in, the solid. In a companion paper, we show through a combination of model experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis that adding an external field that polarizes the active forces strongly affects the dynamical transition to collective actuation. A new oscillatory regime emerges, and a reentrance transition to collective actuation takes place. Depending on the degeneracy of the modes on which the dynamics condensates, and on the orientation of the field with respect to the stiff direction of the solid, several new dynamical regimes can be observed. The purpose of the present paper is to review these dynamical regimes in a comprehensive way, both for the single-particle dynamics and for the coarse-grained one. Whenever possible the dynamical regimes and the transition between them are described analytically, otherwise numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within a model where micrometer-size soft colloidal particles are viewed as liquid drops, we theoretically study the contact interaction between them. We compute the exact deformation energy across a broad range of indentations and for various model parameters, and we show that it can be reproduced using truncated superball and spheropolyhedral variational shapes in the attractive and the repulsive regime, respectively. At large surface tensions representative of microgels, this energy is pairwise additive well beyond small indentations and can be approximated by a power-law dependence on indentation with an exponent around 2.</description>

      <title>Tracer diffusion coefficients in a sheared granular gas. Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of tracer particles immersed in a granular gas under uniform shear flow (USF) is analyzed within the framework of the inelastic Boltzmann equation. Two different but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results. First, we maintain the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator but consider inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). Using IMM allows us to compute the collisional moments of the Boltzmann operator without knowing the velocity distribution functions of the granular binary mixture explicitly. Second, we consider a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres (IHS). This kinetic model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of IHS. We solve the Boltzmann--Lorentz kinetic equation for tracer particles using a generalized Chapman--Enskog--like expansion around the shear flow distribution. This reference distribution retains all hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. The mass flux is obtained to first order in the deviations of the concentration, pressure, and temperature from their values in the reference state. Due to the velocity space anisotropy induced by the shear flow, the mass flux is expressed in terms of tensorial quantities rather than the conventional scalar diffusion coefficients. The exact results derived here are compared with those previously obtained for IHS by using different approximations [JSTAT P02012 (2007)]. The comparison generally shows reasonable quantitative agreement, especially for IMM results. Finally, we study segregation by thermal diffusion as an application of the theory. The phase diagrams illustrating segregation are shown and compared with IHS results, demonstrating qualitative agreement.</description>
