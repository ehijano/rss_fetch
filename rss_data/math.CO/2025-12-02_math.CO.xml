      <title>Simplicial Complex Emergence on Directed Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when co-evolving (or adaptive) higher-order networks defined on directed hypergraphs admit a simplicial description. Binary and triadic couplings are modelled by time-dependent weight tensors. Using representation theory of the symmetric group $S_k$, we decompose these tensors into fully symmetric, fully antisymmetric, and mixed isotypic components, and track their Frobenius norms to define three asymptotic regimes and a quantitative notion of convergence. In the symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) limit, we certify emergence and stability of simplicial complexes via a local boundary test and interior drift conditions that enforce downward-closure; in the mixed limit, we show that the minimal faithful object is a semi-simplicial set. We illustrate the theory with simulations that track the isotypic Frobenius norms and the higher-order structure. Practically, our work provides rigorous conditions under which homological tools are justified for adaptive higher-order systems.</description>

      <title>Signless Laplacian spectral conditions for even factors in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spanning subgraph $F$ of a graph $G$ is defined as an even factor of $G$, if the degree $d_F(v)=2k, k\in\mathbb{N}^+$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. This note establishes a sufficient condition to ensure that a connected graph $G$ of even order with the minimum degree $\delta$ contains an even factor based on the signless Laplacian spectral radius.</description>

      <title>On the nullspace of split graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nullspace of the adjacency matrix of split graphs, whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. We introduce the clique-kernel, a subspace that determines when vertices of the clique appear in the support of a kernel eigenvector. We prove that this subspace is at most one-dimensional, leading to the formula $null(Sp) = null(R) + \dim(\mathrm{Cker}(Sp))$, which fully describes the nullity of a split graph in terms of the bipartite adjacency submatrix $R$. We also analyze unbalanced split graphs through the concept of swing vertices and characterize the structure of their kernel supports. Furthermore, we study the behavior of the nullspace under Tyshkevich composition and derive a closed formula for the determinant using the Schur complement. These results provide a unified algebraic framework for understanding when a split graph is singular and how its combinatorial structure determines its nullspace.</description>

      <title>A formula for the Euler characteristic of a poset through the determinant of the order-complement matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $P$, its zeta matrix $\mathbf Z$ encode fundamental incidence-theoretic information about the order structure. In this paper we introduce and study the \emph{order-complement matrix} $\overline{\mathbf Z} = \mathbf J - \mathbf Z$, where $\mathbf J$ is the all-ones matrix. We prove a closed formula for its characteristic polynomial and for its determinant, showing that $\det(\overline{\mathbf Z}) = (-1)^n \tilde{\chi}(P)$, where $n = |P|$ and $\tilde{\chi}(P)$ is the reduced Euler characteristic of $P$. This provides a new, unexpectedly simple linear-algebraic expression for the Euler characteristic of a poset, complementing existing determinant formulas for matrices derived from incidence relations.</description>

      <title>Normal Ordering in the Algebra Generated by $x$ and $\mathrm{I}$ and a Combinatorial Generalization of Bessel Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the algebra generated by the operators $x$ and $\mathrm{I} = \int_0^x$, which satisfy the commutation relation \[ [\mathrm{I},x] = \mathrm{I}x - x\mathrm{I} = - \mathrm{I}^2. \] We develop a combinatorial framework for the normal ordering of words in this algebra and show that any word can be written in the form \[ w = \sum_{i,j} c(i,j) \, x^i \mathrm{I}^j, \] where the coefficients $c(i,j)$ are signed integers. Focusing on powers of the operator $(x\mathrm{I})^n$, we demonstrate that the corresponding coefficients coincide with the classical Bessel numbers (OEIS A001498). We further extend this analysis to powers of the generalized operators $(x^\lambda \mathrm{I}^\delta)^n$ and, finally, provide an explicit normal-ordered expression for an arbitrary word.</description>

      <title>Generalized Splines over $\mathbb{Z}$-Modules on Arbitrary Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity and $G$ a graph. An extending generalized spline on $G$ is a vertex labeling $f \in \prod_{v} M_v$, where for each edge $e=uv$ there exists an $R$-module $M_{uv}$ together with homomorphisms $ \varphi_u : M_u \to M_{uv}$ and $ \varphi_v : M_v \to M_{uv}$ such that $\varphi_u(f_u)=\varphi_v(f_v).$ Extending generalized splines are further generalizations for generalized splines. They can also be considered as generalized splines over modules.
  In this paper, we prove that some of the results for splines can be extended to generalized splines over modules $M_v=m_v\mathbb Z$ at each vertex $v$ and we define a method of a graph reduction based on graph operations on vertices and edges to produce an explicit $\mathbb{Z}$-module basis for generalized splines over modules. This corresponds to a sequence of surjective homomorphisms between the associated spline modules so that the space of splines decomposes as a direct sum of certain submodules.</description>

      <title>The exponential distance matrix of bi-block graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with vertex set $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_\mathbf{n}\}$. As a variant of the classical distance matrix, the \emph{exponential distance matrix} was introduced independently by Yan and Yeh, and by Bapat et al. For a nonzero indeterminate $q$, the exponential distance matrix $\mathscr{F} = (\mathscr{F}_{ij})_{\mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{n}}$ of $G$ is defined by $\mathscr{F}_{ij} = q^{d_{ij}},$ where $d_{ij}$ denotes the distance between vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ in $G$. A connected graph is said to be a \emph{bi-block graph} if each of its blocks is a complete bipartite graph, possibly of varying bipartition sizes. In this paper, we obtain explicit expressions for the determinant, inverse, and cofactor sum of the exponential distance matrix of bi-block graphs. As a consequence, some known results concerning the exponential distance matrix and the $q$-Laplacian matrix are generalized.</description>

      <title>On the Augmented Sombor Index of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph having more than two vertices and let $d_i$ denote the degree of vertex $v_i$ in $G$. Let $E(G)$ represent the edge set of $G$. Then, the augmented Sombor (ASO) index of $G$ is defined as $ASO(G) = \sum_{v_i v_j \in E(G)} \sqrt{(d_i + d_j - 2)^{-1}(d_i^2 + d_j^2)}.$ It is known that the cycle graph $C_n$ uniquely minimizes the ASO index in the class of all $n$-order unicyclic graphs. In this paper, we prove that the unique $n$-order unicyclic graph of maximum degree $n-1$ maximizes the ASO index in the aforementioned unicyclic graph class. We also prove that $ASO(G-v_iv_j)&lt;ASO(G)$ whenever neither of the graphs $G-v_iv_j$ and $G$ contains any isolated edge. Utilizing this edge-deletion property, we characterize the unique graph maximizing the ASO index among all fixed-order connected graphs with a specified vertex connectivity (or edge connectivity).</description>

      <title>Matrix Quasi-tree Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on prior work that established Matrix Quasi-tree Theorems for special embedded graphs, in this paper, we develop a comprehensive theory applicable to all embedded graphs. We introduce symbolic skew-adjacency matrices and reduction maps as key innovations, and prove that a specific polynomial derived from these matrices encodes all spanning quasi-trees of a bouquet. This result provides a complete analogue of the Matrix Tree Theorem for topological graph theory, with applications to quasi-tree enumeration in both orientable and non-orientable embedded graphs.</description>

      <title>Orbits of toric promotion on bridge sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, Defant introduced toric promotion as a cyclic analogue of Sch\"utzenberger's well known promotion operator. Toric promotion is defined by a choice of simple graph $G$ and acts on the labeling of $G$ by a series of involutions. Defant described the orbit length of toric promotion on trees and showed that it does not depend on the initial labeling; we prove an analogous result for complete graphs. A natural question is how toric promotion behaves under certain graph operations. In the main results of this article, we analyze the orbits of toric promotion under the bridge sum graph operation, which joins two graphs by adding an edge between a vertex of each graph. We show that the orbit length of toric promotion on any graph constructed via a bridge sum of a tree or a complete graph with a simple graph does not depend on the restriction of the initial labeling to the tree or complete subgraph. Additionally, we describe the orbit lengths of toric promotion on the bridge sums of two complete graphs and the bridge sums of a tree with a complete graph, and show that they do not depend on the initial labeling. Finally, we describe the orbit length of toric promotion on the corona product of a complete graph with any tree, and show that it does not depend on the initial labeling.</description>

      <title>Kempe changes in $H$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ and two of the colours, a $Kempe$ $chain$ is a connected component of the subgraph of $G$ induced by the vertices coloured with one of these two colours. A $Kempe$ $swap$ changes one colouring into another by interchanging the colours of the vertices in a Kempe chain. Two colourings are $Kempe$ $equivalent$ if each can be obtained from the other by a series of Kempe swaps; the set of Kempe equivalent colourings is called a $Kempe$ $class$. For a graph $G$, let $\chi(G)$ denote its chromatic number and let $\mathcal{C}_{k}(G)$ denote the set of all $k$-colourings of $G$. We say $G$ is $Kempe$ $connected$ if for all $k\ge \chi(G)$, $\mathcal{C}_{k}(G)$ forms a Kempe class. For a graph $H$, graph $G$ is called $H$-$free$ if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to $H$.
  We prove that every $H$-free graph is Kempe connected if and only if $H$ is an induced subgraph of the path on four vertices, $P_4$.
  The graph 2$K_2$ consists of four vertices and two edges which are not adjacent. We prove that for all $p\ge 0$, there is a $k$-colourable 2$K_2$-free graph $G$ such that $\mathcal{C}_{k+p}(G)$ does not form a Kempe class.</description>

      <title>Degree 2 vertices in minimal prime graph complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal prime graphs are connected graphs on at least two vertices whose complements satisfy the following conditions: triangle-freeness, 3- colorability, and edge-maximality with respect to the latter two properties. These graphs are prime graphs (or Gruenberg-Kegel graphs) of finite solv- able groups with the maximum number of Frobenius actions among their Sylow subgroups, and as such minimal prime graph complements have been shown to be highly structured, including, for instance, the presence of induced 5-cycles. It is also known that the minimum degree of minimal prime graph complements is 2. In this note, we show that the existence of a degree 2 vertex in a minimal prime graph complement determines its whole structure: it is simply a 5-cycle with three vertices, exactly two of which are adjacent to each other, being duplicated finitely often. In particular, such graphs belong to a class of graphs known as reseminant.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker resolving game played on lexicographic products of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Maker-Breaker resolving game, two players named Resolver and Spoiler alternately select unplayed vertices of a given graph $G$. The aim of Resolver is to select all the vertices of some resolving set of $G$, while Spoiler aims to select at least one vertex from every resolving set of $G$. In this paper, this game is investigated on the lexicographic product of graphs. It is proved that if Spoiler has a winning strategy on a graph $H$ no matter who starts the game, or if the first player has a winning strategy on $H$, then Spoiler always has a winning strategy on $G\circ H$. Special attention is paid to lexicographic products in which the second factor is either complete, or a path, or a cycle. For instance, in $G\circ P_{2\ell}$ and in $G\circ C_{2\ell}$, Resolver always wins, while in $G\circ P_{2\ell+1}$ and in $G\circ C_{2\ell+1}$ the same conclusion holds provided $G$ is free from false twins. On the other hand, Spoiler always wins on $G\circ P_5$. In most of the cases, the corresponding Maker-Breaker resolving number is also determined.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give the relationship between spectral radius and local structures of graphs and hypergraphs. Our work shows that certain local subgraphs (subhypergraphs) must occur when the spectral radius ratio is large. We also give spectral bounds on the local vector chromatic number in terms of tensor eigenvalues of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Raimi's classical partition theorem to the continuous setting of the circle and $n$-dimensional torus. Building on recent work of Hegyv\'ari, Pach, and Pham in finite groups, we prove that there exist measurable partitions of the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^n$ with the property that for any finite measurable cover, some translated part of the cover has positive measure intersection with every partition element. Our proof adapts combinatorial arguments from the finite setting using measure-theoretic techniques and slicing arguments in product spaces.</description>

      <title>MacMahon-type $q$-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by earlier work of P.~A.~MacMahon and recent contributions of T.~Amdeberhan, G.~E.~Andrews, K.~Ono, A.~Singh, and R.~Tauraso on higher-order partition enumerants, we study a class of $q$-series arising from nested divisor structures. In particular, we consider the $q$-series \[ V_k(q) = \sum_{1 \le n_1 \le n_2 \le \cdots \le n_k} \frac{q^{\,n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_k}} {(1-q^{n_1})^2(1-q^{n_2})^2\cdots(1-q^{n_k})^2}, \] introduced recently as MacMahon-type generating functions. We further define a new MacMahon-type series \[ W_k(q) = \sum_{1 \le n_1 \le n_2 \le \cdots \le n_k} \frac{q^{\,2(n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_k)-k}} {(1-q^{2n_1-1})^2(1-q^{2n_2-1})^2\cdots(1-q^{2n_k-1})^2}, \] and establish families of identities, generating function relations, and hypergeometric representations for the truncated forms of $V_k(q)$ and $W_k(q)$. Connections with overpartition pairs and bipartitions with distinct odd parts arise naturally in this context.</description>

      <title>Triangular Arrays using context-free grammar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the grammar of Hao \[ G=\{\, u\rightarrow u^{b_1+b_2+1} v^{a_1+a_2},\quad v\rightarrow u^{b_2}v^{a_2+1} \,\}, \] together with the correspondence between grammars and Combinatorial Differential Equations, is employed to obtain an interpretation of any triangular array of the form \[ T(n,k)=(a_2 n + a_1 k + a_0)\,T(n-1,k) + (b_2 n + b_1 k + b_0)\,T(n-1,k-1). \] Explicit formulas and structural properties are then derived through Analytic Differential Equations. In particular, the $r$-Whitney--Eulerian numbers and the cases where $b_2n+b_1k+b_0=1$ are obtained explicitly. Applications include new interpretation formulas for the $r$-Eulerian numbers with generating function for a special case.
  Keywords: triangular recurrence, formal grammar, Combinatorial operators, differential equations,$r$-Eulerian, combinatorial interpretation, $r$-Whitney--Eulerian.</description>

      <title>On vertex-minimal simplicial maps to the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For positive integers $n,d$, let $\lambda(n,d)$ be the minimal number of vertices of a triangulation of $n$-sphere which admits a degree $d$ simplicial map to the boundary of $(n+1)$-simplex. We show that $\lim_{d\to\infty}\frac{\lambda(n,d)}d=0$ for any $n\ge3$, disproving O. Musin's conjecture. Using similar idea, for any $C$ we construct a triangulation of $\mathbb{S}^n$, $n\ge3$, for which $\frac{f_j}{f_i}&gt;C$, for any $0\le i&lt;j\le n$ such that $i&lt;\lfloor\frac{n-1}2\rfloor$. All triangulations we obtain are isomorphic to boundaries of convex polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chromatic Number of Subgraphs of Orthogonality Graphs and the Distance-2 Hamming Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the quantum chromatic number of graphs has attracted considerable attention recently. However, there are few families of graphs whose quantum chromatic numbers are determined. A notable exception is the family of orthogonality graphs, whose quantum chromatic numbers are fully determined. In this paper, we extend these results by determining the exact quantum chromatic number of several subgraphs of the orthogonality graphs. Using the technique of combinatorial designs, we also determine the quantum chromatic number of the distance-2 Hamming graph, whose edges consist of binary vectors of Hamming distance 2, for infinitely many length.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a formula for the number of lattice points in type B generalized permutohedra, providing a concise alternative to the formula obtained recently by Eur, Fink, Larson, and Spink as a result from a study of delta-matroids. Our approach builds upon the existing framework and techniques introduced by Postnikov in his work on type A generalized permutohedra, a family of polytopes interconnected with many mathematical concepts such as matroids and Weyl groups. In particular, we express the number of lattice points in type B generalized permutohedra in terms of Postnikov's notion of G-draconian sequences, from which their Ehrhart polynomials and volume formula follow as consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a real number $c &gt; 4$, we prove that every graph $G$ with $\alpha(G) \leq 2$ and $|V(G)| \geq ct$ has a matching $M$ with $|M| = t$ such that the number of non-adjacent pairs of edges in $M$ is at most: \begin{equation*}
  \left( \frac{1}{c\left(c-1\right)^2} + O_c\left(t^{-1/3} \right) \right) \binom{t}{2}. \end{equation*} This is related to an open problem of Seymour (2016) about Hadwiger's Conjecture, who asked if there is a constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that every graph $G$ with $\alpha(G) \leq 2$ has $\text{had}(G) \geq (\frac{1}{3} + \varepsilon) |V(G)|$.</description>

      <title>Localization of spectral Tur\'{a}n-type theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph, and let $v$ and $e$ be a vertex and an edge of $G$, respectively. Define $c(v)$ (resp. $c(e)$) to be the order of the largest clique in $G$ containing $v$ (resp. $e$). Denote the adjacency eigenvalues of $G$ by $\lambda_1 \ge \cdots \ge \lambda_n$. We study localized refinements of spectral Tur\'{a}n-type theorems by replacing global parameters such as the clique number $\omega(G)$, size $m$ and order $n$ of $G$ with local quantities $c(v)$ and $c(e)$.
  Motivated by a conjecture of Elphick, Linz and Wocjan (2024), we first propose a vertex-localized strengthening of Wilf's inequality: \[ \sqrt{s^{+}(G)} \le \sum_{v\in V(G)}\left(1-\frac{1}{c(v)}\right), \] where $s^+(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &gt; 0}\lambda_i^2$. Inspired by the Bollob\'{a}s-Nikiforov conjecture (2007) on the first two eigenvalues, we then introduce an edge-localized analogue: \[\lambda_1^2(G) + \lambda_2^2(G) \le \sum_{e\in E(G)} 2\left(1-\frac{1}{c(e)}\right).\] As evidence of their validity, we verify the above conjectures for diamond-free graphs and random graphs. We also propose strengthening of the spectral versions of the Erd\H{o}s, Stone and Simonovits Theorem by replacing the spectral radius with $\sqrt{s^{+}(G)}$ and establish it for all $F$-free graphs with $\chi(F)=3$. A key ingredient in our proofs is a general upper bound relating $\sqrt{s^{+}(G)}$ to the triangle count $t(G)$. Finally, we prove a localized version of Nikiforov's walk inequality and conjecture a stronger localized version. These results contribute to the broader program of localizing spectral extremal inequalities.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds for expected propagation time of probabilistic zero forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probabilistic zero forcing process, a probabilistic variant of the classical zero forcing process. We show that for every connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, there exists an initial set consisting of a single vertex such that the expected propagation time is $n/2 + O(1)$. This result is tight and confirms a conjecture posed by Narayanan and Sun. Additionally, we show tight bounds on the probabilistic throttling number, which captures the trade-off between the size of the initial set and the speed of propagation. Namely, we show that for every connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, there exists an initial set consisting of $O(\sqrt{n})$ vertices such that the expected propagation time is $O(\sqrt{n})$. This improves upon previous results by Geneson and Hogben, and confirms another conjecture by Narayanan and Sun.</description>

      <title>The edge chromatic transformation index of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph or multigraph $G$, let $\chi'_{trans}(G)$ denote the minimum integer $n$ such that any proper $\chi'(G)$--edge coloring of $G$ can be transformed into any other proper $\chi'(G)$--edge coloring of $G$ by a series of transformations such that each of the intermediate colorings is a proper $\chi'(G)$--edge coloring of $G$ and each of the transformations involves at most $n$ color classes of the previous coloring. We call $\chi'_{trans}(G)$ the {\it edge chromatic transformation index of $G$}.
  In this paper we show that if $G$ is a graph with maximum degree at least $4$, where every block is either a bipartite graph, a series-parallel graph, a chordless graph, a wheel graph or a planar graph of girth at least $7$, then $\chi'_{trans}(G)\leq 4$. This bound is sharp for series-parallel and wheel graphs. We also show that $\chi'_{trans}(G)\leq 8$ for all planar graphs $G$, $\chi'_{trans}(G)\leq 5$ if $G$ is a Halin graph and $\chi'_{trans}(G)=2$ if $G$ is a regular bipartite planar multigraph. Finally, we consider the analogous problem for vertex colorings, and show that for any $k\geq 3$ there is an infinite class $\cal G$$(k)$ of graphs with chromatic number $k$ such that for every $G\in \cal G$$(k)$ any two proper $k$-vertex colorings of $G$
  can be transformed to each other only by a transformation, involving all $k$ color classes.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-spectral Tur\'an type problems for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0 \leq \alpha &lt; 1$, the $\alpha$-spectral radius of a graph $G$ is defined as
  the largest eigenvalue of $A_{\alpha}(G)=\alpha D(G)+(1-\alpha)A(G)$, where $D(G)$ and $A(G)$ are the diagonal matrix of degrees and adjacency matrix of $G$, respectively.
  A graph is called color-critical if it contains an edge whose deletion reduces its chromatic number.
  The celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits theorem asserts that $ \mathrm{ex}(n,\mathcal{F})=\left(1-\frac{1}{\chi(\mathcal{F})-1}+o(1)\right)\frac{n^2}{2},$
  where $\chi(\mathcal{F})$ is the chromatic number of $\mathcal{F}$.
  Nikiforov and Zheng et al. established the adjacency spectral and signless Laplacian spectral versions of this theorem, respectively.
  In this paper, we present the $\alpha$-spectral version of this theorem, which unifies the aforementioned results. Furthermore, we characterize the $\alpha$-spectral extremal graphs for color-critical graphs, thereby extending the existing results on adjacency spectral and signless Laplacian spectral extremal graphs for such graphs.</description>

      <title>Feedback vertex sets of digraphs with bounded maximum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph $D$ is an oriented graph if $D$ does not have a pair of opposite arcs. The degree of a vertex $v$ of $D$ is the sum of the in-degree and out-degree of $v.$ Let $fvs(D)$ be the minimum number of vertices whose deletion from $D$ makes it acyclic. Let $D$ be a digraph with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $\Delta$. We prove the following bounds. If $D$ is an oriented graph, then $fvs(D)\leq \frac{3n}{7}$ when $\Delta\le 4$ and $fvs(D)\leq \frac{n}{2}$ when $\Delta\le 5$. If $D$ is a connected digraph, $\Delta\le 4$ and $D$ is not obtained from an odd undirected cycle by replacing every edge with the pair of opposite arcs with the same endvertices, then $fvs(D)\leq \frac{n}{2}$. If $D$ is an arbitrary digraph with $\Delta\le 5$ then $fvs(D)\leq \frac{2n}{3}.$ Note that all the above bounds are tight.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the largest eigenvalue and sum of Laplacian eigenvalues of signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the bounds for the largest eigenvalue and the sum of the $k$ largest Laplacian eigenvalues of signed graphs. Firstly, we give an upper bound on the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a signed graph and characterize the extremal graphs that attain this bound. Secondly, we prove that a non-bipartite signed graph $\Gamma$ of order $n$ and size $m$ contains a balanced triangle if $\lambda_{1}(\Gamma)\ge \sqrt{m-1}$, $\lambda_{1}(\Gamma) \ge |\lambda_{n}(\Gamma)|$ and $\Gamma\not \sim (C_{5}\cup (n-5)K_{1},+)$, where $\lambda_{1}(\Gamma)$ is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$. Thirdly, we confirm a conjecture proposed in [Linear Multilinear Algebra 51 (1) (2003) 21--30] that: if $\Gamma$ is a connected signed graph, then
  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^{k}\mu_{i}(\Gamma) &gt;\sum_{i=1}^{k}d_{i}(\Gamma)~~(1\le k\le n-1),
  $$
  where $\mu_{1}(\Gamma)\ge\mu_{2}(\Gamma)\ge\cdots \ge \mu_{n}(\Gamma)$ are Laplacian eigenvalues of $\Gamma$, and $d_{1}(\Gamma)\ge d_{2}(\Gamma)\ge \dots \ge d_{n}(\Gamma)$ are vertex degrees of $\Gamma$. Finally, we give a lower bound for the sum of the $k$ largest Laplacian eigenvalues of a connected signed graph.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of finite projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic number of the finite projective space $\mathrm{PG}(n-1,q)$, denoted $\chi_q(n)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color its points so that no line is monochromatic. We establish a recursive upper bound $\chi_q(n) \leq \chi_q(d) + \chi_q(n - d)$ for all $1 \leq d &lt; n$ and use it to prove new upper bounds on $\chi_q(n)$ for all $q$.
  For $q = 2$, we further refine this recursion and prove that \[ \chi_2(n) \le \lfloor 2n/3 \rfloor + 1 \] for all $n \ge 2$, and that this bound is tight for all $n \le 7$. In particular, this recovers all previously known cases for $n \le 6$ and resolves the first open case $n = 7$. On the lower-bound side, using a connection with multicolor Ramsey numbers for triangles, we note that \[ \chi_2(n) \ge (1 - o(1))\,\frac{n}{\log n}. \]
  We also consider $\chi_q(t;n)$, the minimum number of colors needed to color the points of $\mathrm{PG}(n-1,q)$ with no monochromatic $(t - 1)$-dimensional subspace, and establish an equivalence between $\chi_q(t;n)$ and the multicolor vector-space Ramsey numbers $R_q(t;k)$. Using this equivalence together with our upper bounds on $\chi_q(t;n)$, we improve, for every fixed $t$, the best known lower bounds on $R_q(t;k)$ from $\Omega_q(\log k)$ to $\Omega(k)$. Finally, we improve the upper bound on $R_2(2;k)$ from a tower function of height $k$ to the function $k \log k$.</description>

      <title>Excluding a Forest Induced Minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first paper of the Graph Minors series [JCTB '83], Robertson and Seymour proved the Forest Minor theorem: the $H$-minor-free graphs have bounded pathwidth if and only if $H$ is a forest. In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the unavoidable induced substructures of graphs with large pathwidth or large treewidth. In this paper, we give an induced counterpart of the Forest Minor theorem: for any $t \geqslant 2$, the $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free $H$-induced-minor-free graphs have bounded pathwidth if and only if $H$ belongs to a class $\mathcal F$ of forests, which we describe as the induced minors of two (very similar) infinite parameterized families. This constitutes a significant step toward classifying the graphs $H$ for which every weakly sparse $H$-induced-minor-free class has bounded treewidth. Our work builds on the theory of constellations developed in the Induced Subgraphs and Tree Decompositions series.</description>

      <title>Minimally tough series-parallel graphs with toughness at least $1/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $t$ be a positive real number. A graph is called \emph{$t$-tough} if the removal of any vertex set $S$ that disconnects the graph leaves at most $|S|/t$ components. The toughness of a graph is the largest $t$ for which the graph is $t$-tough. A graph is minimally $t$-tough if the toughness of the graph is $t$, and the deletion of any edge from the graph decreases the toughness. Series--parallel graphs are graphs with two distinguished vertices called
  terminals, formed recursively by two simple composition operations, series
  and parallel joins. They can be used to model series and parallel electric circuits.
  We characterize the minimally $t$-tough series-parallel graphs for all $t\ge 1/2$. It is clear that there is no minimally $t$-tough series-parallel graph if $t&gt;1$. We show that for $1\ge t &gt;1/2$, most of the series-parallel graphs with toughness $t$ are minimally $t$-tough, but most of the series-parallel graphs with toughness $1/2$ are not minimally $1/2$-tough.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant mutual-visibility: complexity and solutions for grid-like networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks are often modeled using graphs, and within this setting we introduce the notion of $k$-fault-tolerant mutual visibility. Informally, a set of vertices $X \subseteq V(G)$ in a graph $G$ is a $k$-fault-tolerant mutual-visibility set ($k$-ftmv set) if any two vertices in $X$ are connected by a bundle of $k+1$ shortest paths such that: ($i$) each shortest path contains no other vertex of $X$, and ($ii$) these paths are internally disjoint. The cardinality of a largest $k$-ftmv set is denoted by $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$. The classical notion of mutual visibility corresponds to the case $k = 0$.
  This generalized concept is motivated by applications in communication networks, where agents located at vertices must communicate both efficiently (i.e., via shortest paths) and confidentially (i.e., without messages passing through the location of any other agent). The original notion of mutual visibility may fail in unreliable networks, where vertices or links can become unavailable.
  Several properties of $k$-ftmv sets are established, including a natural relationship between $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$ and $\omega(G)$, as well as a characterization of graphs for which $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$ is large. It is shown that computing $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$ is NP-hard for any positive integer $k$, whether $k$ is fixed or not. Exact formulae for $\mathrm{f}\mu^{k}(G)$ are derived for several specific graph topologies, including grid-like networks such as cylinders and tori, and for diameter-two networks defined by Hamming graphs and by the direct product of complete graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_d$ be real numbers, and let $S$ be the set of integers $s$ so that $||\alpha_i s||_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}&gt;\delta$ for some $i$ and some fixed $\delta&gt;0$. We prove $S$ is not \enquote{$2$-large}, i.e. there is a $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ that avoids arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$.</description>

      <title>On the linear complexity of subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ bounded $\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work of the second author and Wolf showed that given a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_p^n$ of bounded $\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension, there is a high rank quadratic factor $\mathcal{B}$ of bounded complexity such that $A$ is approximately equal to a union of atoms of $\mathcal{B}$. That proof yielded bounds of tower type on the linear and quadratic complexities. It was later shown by the same authors that the quadratic complexity can be improved to logarithmic, however that proof provided no improvement on the linear component. In this paper we prove that the bound on the linear complexity can be improved to a triple exponential in the case of linear rank functions, and a quadruple exponential for polynomial rank functions of higher degree.
  Our strategy is based on the one developed by Gishboliner, Wigderson, and Shapira to prove the analogous result in the hypergraph setting. Step 1 is to prove a``cylinder" version of the quadratic arithmetic regularity lemma, which says that given a set $A\subseteq G=\mathbb{F}_p^n$, there is a partition of $G$ into atoms of (possibly distinct) quadratic factors of high rank and bounded complexity, so that most atoms in the partition are uniform with respect to the set $A$, in the sense of a certain local $U^3$ norm. Step 2 is to show that if $A$ has bounded $\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension, then it has density near $0$ or $1$ on all atoms which are uniform in the sense of Step 1. Step 1 relies on a recent local version of the $U^3$ inverse theorem due to Prendiville, and is necessarily phrased in terms of a local $U^3$ norm implicit in that paper. On the other hand, Step 2 relies on a counting lemma for a different local $U^3$ due to Terry and Wolf, which we prove here is approximately the same as the local $U^3$ norm used in Step 1.</description>

      <title>The Bottleneck Birthday Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fun problem that can be considered as a variant of the classic birthday problem, the Bottleneck Birthday Problem (BBP). It is stated as: what is the maximum number of people we have to choose so that no day of the year has more than $r \geq 1$ birthdays incident on it with probability at least 1/2? We provide a survey of techniques used in the literature on occupancy and load balancing problems to derive recurrence relations for exact computation of the probability and the number of people, keeping probability fixed at a threshold. Further, we show that restricted Stirling numbers of the second kind can be used to derive an additional recurrence, in a novel way. We provide numerical results from an implementation of the recurrences.</description>

      <title>Simple Eigenvalues and Non-vanishing Eigenvectors of the Anderson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson model on the finite grid $G = \mathbb Z/L_1\mathbb Z\times\cdots\times\mathbb Z/L_d\mathbb Z$, defined by the random Hamiltonian $H_t=\Delta+tV$, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian and $V=\mathrm{diag}(\{\omega_{x}\}_{x\in G})$ is a random onsite potential with $\omega_x\sim\mu$ i.i.d. We ask the natural question of when $H_t$ has simple eigenvalues and non-vanishing eigenvectors. We prove that, when $\mu$ is a continuous probability distribution, $H_t$ has this property for all but finitely many $t$ values with probability $1$. However, when $\mu$ is a Bernoulli distribution, the conditions fail with positive probability, for which we give a lower bound. We also calculate the exact probability of these conditions being met in the Bernoulli case when $d = 1$ and $L = L_1$ is prime.</description>

Abstract: We provide a complete and explicit characterization of the exposed extreme rays of the cone of sums of nonnegative circuit (SONC) polynomials. The criterion we derive is purely combinatorial and depends only on the existence of certain circuits within the ground set and on the nature of the corresponding extreme ray. Our constructive proofs also yield explicit exposing functionals, offering a basis for algorithmic detection of exposed rays in SONC-based optimization.</description>

      <title>Freidel-Maillet type equations on fused K-matrices over the positive part of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The positive part $U_q^+$ of the quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ has a reflection equation presentation of Freidel-Maillet type, due to Baseilhac 2021. This presentation involves a K-matrix of dimension $2 \times 2$. Under an embedding of $U_q^+$ into a $q$-shuffle algebra due to Rosso 1995, this K-matrix can be written in closed form using a PBW basis for $U_q^+$ due to Terwilliger 2019. This PBW basis, together with two PBW bases due to Damiani 1993 and Beck 1994, can be obtain from a uniform approach by Ruan 2025. Following a natural fusion technique, we will construct fused K-matrices of arbitary meaningful dimension in closed form using the uniform approach. We will also show that any pair of these fused K-matrices satisfy Freidel-Maillet type equations.</description>

      <title>A Fast Algorithm for Finding Minimum Weight Cycles in Mining Cyclic Graph Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic structures are fundamental topological features in graphs, playing critical roles in network robustness, information flow, community structure, and various dynamic processes. Algorithmic tools that can efficiently probe and analyze these cyclic topologies are increasingly vital for tasks in graph mining, network optimization, bioinformatics, and social network analysis. A core primitive for quantitative analysis of cycles is finding the Minimum Weight Cycle (MWC), representing the shortest cyclic path in a weighted graph. However, computing the MWC efficiently remains a challenge, particularly compared to shortest path computations. This paper introduces a novel deterministic algorithm for finding the MWC in general weighted graphs. Our approach adapts the structure of Dijkstra's algorithm by introducing and minimizing a \textit{composite distance} metric, effectively translating the global cycle search into an iterative node-centric optimization. We provide a rigorous proof of correctness based on loop invariants. We detail two mechanisms for accelerating the search: a provable node discarding technique based on intermediate results, and a highly effective graph pruning heuristic. This heuristic dynamically restricts the search to relevant subgraphs, leveraging the principle of locality often present in complex networks to achieve significant empirical speedups, while periodic resets ensure global optimality is maintained. The efficiency of the proposed MWC algorithm enables its use as a core component in more complex analyses focused on cyclic properties. We illustrate this through a detailed application case study: accelerating the computation of the Loop Modulus, a measure of cycle richness used in advanced network characterization. Our algorithm dramatically reduces the runtime of the iterative constraint-finding bottleneck in this computation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we deal with a subclass of chordal graphs, which are simultaneously strictly chordal and interval, the strictly interval graphs. We present a new characterization of the class that leads to a simple linear recognition algorithm. Next we introduce a new subclass of strictly interval graphs, the $SI$-core graphs, that are non-split and non-cograph graphs and show that several elements of the new class are Laplacian integral.</description>

Abstract: We study the homology group of the Milnor fiber boundary of a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$. By the work of N\'emethi--Szil\'ard, the homeomorphism type of the Milnor fiber boundary is combinatorially determined, and an explicit formula for the first Betti number is known. However, the torsion part of the first homology group is poorly understood. In this paper, under some conditions, we prove that the number of even-order torsion summands of the first homology group is greater than or equal to the Euler characteristic of the projectivized complement.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of integers sharing the same rooted-tree structure that encodes their complete prime factorization tower. For each tree we derive an explicit density formula depending only on a pair $(m,k)$, the density signature of the tree, up to a suitable multiplicative scalar factor and introduce the corresponding tree zeta function, which generalizes the prime zeta function. Classical results such as the prime number theorem and later work by Landau appear as special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph parameter treedepth is minor-monotone; hence, the class of graphs with treedepth at most $k$ is minor-closed. By the Graph Minor Theorem, such a class is characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors. A conjecture of Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Giannopoulou, and Thilikos states that every such forbidden minor has at most $2^k$ vertices. We present an algorithm that, given $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$, computes the set of forbidden minors, forbidden subgraphs, and forbidden induced subgraphs on at most $n$ vertices, for the class of graphs of treedepth at most $k$. Applying this algorithm to $k = 4$ and $n = 16$, we enumerate 1546 forbidden minors, 1718 forbidden subgraphs, and 12204 forbidden induced subgraphs. Assuming the above conjecture holds, these sets constitute the complete obstruction sets for graphs of treedepth at most 4.</description>

Abstract: We study the representation theory of the infinite type A Hecke algebra over a non-Archimedean field in the case where the parameter is a pseudo-uniformizer. Specifically, we consider a family of representations, called almost-symmetric, which satisfy additional topological and algebraic constraints. We give a full classification of the irreducible almost-symmetric representations. These turn out to be indexed by integer partitions arising as topological completions of specific direct limits of Hecke-Specht modules. We give detailed analysis of these representations and construct functionals analogous to finite Hecke algebra traces.</description>

Abstract: In this article, $q$-regular sequences in the sense of Allouche and Shallit are analysed asymptotically. It is shown that the summatory function of a regular sequence can asymptotically be decomposed as a finite sum of periodic fluctuations multiplied by a scaling factor. Each of these terms corresponds to an eigenvalue of the sum of matrices of a linear representation of the sequence; only the eigenvalues of absolute value larger than the joint spectral radius of the matrices contribute terms which grow faster than the error term.
  The paper has a particular focus on the Fourier coefficients of the periodic fluctuations: They are expressed as residues of the corresponding Dirichlet generating function. This makes it possible to compute them in an efficient way. The asymptotic analysis deals with Mellin--Perron summations and uses two arguments to overcome convergence issues, namely H\"older regularity of the fluctuations together with a pseudo-Tauberian argument.
  Apart from the very general result, three examples are discussed in more detail: sequences defined as the sum of outputs written by a transducer when reading a $q$-ary expansion of the input; the amount of esthetic numbers in the first~$N$ natural numbers; and the number of odd entries in the rows of Pascal's rhombus. For these examples, very precise asymptotic formul\ae{} are presented. In the latter two examples, prior to this analysis only rough estimates were known.</description>

      <title>Two classes of posets with real-rooted chain polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coefficients of the chain polynomial of a finite poset enumerate chains in the poset by their number of elements. It has been a challenging open problem to determine which posets have real-rooted chain polynomials. Two new classes of posets, namely those of all rank-selected subposets of Cohen-Macaulay simplicial posets and all noncrossing partition lattices associated to finite Coxeter groups, are shown to have this property. The first result generalizes one of Brenti and Welker. As a special case, the descent enumerator of permutations of the set $\{1, 2,\dots,n\}$ which have ascents at specified positions is shown to be real-rooted, hence log-concave and unimodal, and a good estimate for the location of the peak is deduced.</description>

Abstract: The Brion morphism maps a generalized permutahedron to a collection of posets associated to its vertices. We compute this map explicitly for the Hopf monoids of permutahedra, associahedra, and orbit polytopes, and we explore the dual Brion map of the primitive Lie monoids associated to these three Hopf monoids. We describe the Lie monoid structure of the primitives in this dual setting and in particular we show that the Lie monoid of primitives of associahedra is isomorphic to the positive part of the Witt Lie algebra</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extremal graphs $\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ and spectral extremal graphs $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)$ are the sets of graphs on $n$ vertices with maximum number of edges and maximum spectral radius, respectively, with no subgraph in $\mathcal F$. We prove a general theorem which allows us to characterize the spectral extremal graphs for a wide range of forbidden families $\mathcal F$ and implies several new and existing results. In particular, whenever $\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ contains the complete bipartite graph $K_{k,n-k}$ (or certain similar graphs) then $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)$ contains the same graph when $n$ is sufficiently large. We prove a similar theorem which relates $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)$ and $\mathrm{SPEX}_\alpha(n,\mathcal F)$, the set of $\mathcal F$-free graphs which maximize the spectral radius of the matrix $A_\alpha=\alpha D+(1-\alpha)A$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $D$ is the diagonal degree matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Paley graphs and Paley sum graphs are classical examples of quasi-random graphs. In this paper, we provide new constructions of families of quasi-random graphs that behave like Paley graphs but are neither Cayley graphs nor Cayley sum graphs. These graphs give a unified perspective of studying various graphs arising from polynomials over finite fields, such as Paley graphs, Paley sum graphs, and graphs arising from Diophantine tuples and their generalizations. We also obtain lower bounds on the clique and independence numbers of the graphs in these families.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider induced subgraphs of the Hamming graph $H(n,3)$. We show that if $U \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_3^n$ and $U$ induces a subgraph of $H(n,3)$ with maximum degree at most $1$ then
  1. If $U$ is disjoint from a maximum size independent set of $H(n,3)$ then $|U| \leq 3^{n-1}+1$. Moreover, all such $U$ with size $3^{n-1}+1$ are isomorphic to each other.
  2. For $n \geq 6$, there exists such a $U$ with size $|U| = 3^{n-1}+18$ and this is optimal for $n = 6$.
  3. If $U \cap \{x, x+e_1, x+2e_1\} \ne \phi$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}_3^n$ then $|U| \leq 3^{n-1} + 81$.</description>

      <title>Colorful positive bases decomposition and Helly-type results for cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following colorful Helly-type result: Fix $k \in [d-1]$. Assume $\mathcal{A}_1, \dots, \mathcal{A}_{d+(d-k)+1}$ are finite sets (colors) of nonzero vectors in $\R^d$. If for every rainbow sub-selection $R$ from these sets of size at most $\max \{d+1, 2(d-k+1)\}$, the system $\langle {a},{x} \rangle \leq 0,\; a \in R$ has at least $k$ linearly independent solutions, then at least one of the systems $\langle {a},{x} \rangle \leq 0,\; a \in \mathcal{A}_i,$ $i \in [d+(d-k)+1]$ has at least $k$ linearly independent solutions.
  A \emph{rainbow sub-selection} from several sets refers to choosing at most one element from each set (color).
  The Helly number $\max \{d+1, 2(d-k+1)\}$ and the number of colors $d+(d-k)+1$ are optimal.
  Our key observation is a certain colorful Carath\'eodory-type result for positive bases.</description>

      <title>Shuffle squares and ordered nest-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A shuffle square is a word consisting of two shuffled copies of the same word. For instance, the Turkish word $\mathtt{\color{red}{ik}\color{blue}{i}\color{red}{li}\color{blue}{kli}}$ (binary in English) is a shuffle square, as it can be split into two copies of the word $\mathtt{ikli}$. We explore a representation of shuffle squares in terms of \emph{ordered nest-free graphs} and demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to several families of binary words. Among others, we characterize shuffle squares with four and five runs, as well as shuffle squares with all $\mathtt1$-runs of length one (and with the $\mathtt1$'s alternating between the two copies). In our main result we provide quite general sufficient conditions for a binary word not to be a shuffle square.
  In particular, it follows that binary words of the type $(\mathtt{1001})^n$, $n$ odd, are not shuffle squares. We complement it by showing that all other words whose every $\mathtt{1}$-run has length one or two, while every $\mathtt{0}$-run has length two, are shuffle squares.
  We also provide a counterexample to a believable stipulation that binary words of the form $\mathtt1^{m}\mathtt0^{m-2}\mathtt1^{m-4}\cdots$, $m$ odd, are far from being shuffle squares (the distance measured by the minimum number of letters one has to delete in order to turn a word into a shuffle square).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized polymorphism of a predicate $P \subseteq \{0,1\}^m$ is a tuple of functions $f_1,\dots,f_m\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ satisfying the following property: If $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)} \in \{0,1\}^n$ are such that $(x^{(1)}_i,\dots,x^{(m)}_i) \in P$ for all $i$, then also $(f_1(x^{(1)}),\dots,f_m(x^{(m)})) \in P$.
  We show that if $f_1,\dots,f_m$ satisfy this property for most $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)}$ (as measured with respect to an arbitrary full support distribution $\mu$ on $P$), then $f_1,\dots,f_m$ are close to a generalized polymorphism of $P$ (with respect to the marginals of $\mu$).
  Our main result generalizes several results in the literature: linearity testing, quantitative Arrow theorems, approximate intersecting families, AND testing, and more generally $f$-testing.</description>

      <title>Matroids are Equitable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if the ground set of a matroid can be partitioned into $k\ge 2$ bases, then for any given subset $S$ of the ground set, there is a partition into $k$ bases such that the sizes of the intersections of the bases with $S$ may differ by at most one. This settles the matroid equitability conjecture by Fekete and Szab\'o (Electron. J. Comb. 2011) in the affirmative. We also investigate equitable splittings of two disjoint sets $S_1$ and $S_2$, and show that there is a partition into $k$ bases such that the sizes of the intersections with $S_1$ may differ by at most one and the sizes of the intersections with $S_2$ may differ by at most two; this is the best one can hope for arbitrary matroids.
  We also derive applications of this result into matroid constrained fair division problems. We show that there exists a matroid-constrained fair division that is envy-free up to one item if the valuations are identical and tri-valued additive. We also show that for bi-valued additive valuations, there exists a matroid-constrained allocation that provides everyone their maximin share.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chung and Graham [J. London Math. Soc., 1983] claimed that there exists an $n$-vertex graph $G$ containing all $n$-vertex trees as subgraphs that has at most $\frac{5}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n)$ edges. We identify an error in their proof. This error can be corrected by adding more edges, which increases the number of edges to $e(G) \leq \frac{7}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n)$. Moreover, we further improve this by showing that there exists such an $n$-vertex graph with at most $\left(5- \frac{1}{3}\right)n \log_3 n + O(n) \leq 2.945 n \log_2 n$ edges. This is the first improvement of the bound since Chung and Graham's pioneering work four decades ago.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two types of corona products for simple directed graphs are introduced, extending the classical notions from the undirected setting: the vertex-corona and the arc-corona. Their structural and spectral properties are investigated through the use of digraph coronals, with particular emphasis on the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian spectra. Finally, the coronals corresponding to these three matrices are computed for several families of digraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the number of $k$-neighborly reorientations of an oriented matroid, leading to study $k$-Roudneff's conjecture, the case $k=1$ being the original statement conjectured in 1991. We first prove the conjecture for the family of Lawrence oriented matroids (LOMs) with even rank $r=2k+2$ and also for low ranks by computer. Next, we provide a general upper bound for the number of $k$-neighborly reorientations of any LOM. Finally, we prove that for any $k\ge 1$ and any oriented matroid on $n$ elements, $k$-Roudneff's conjecture holds asymptotically as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and thus giving more credit to the conjecture.</description>

Abstract: For any fixed dimension $d \geq 3$ we construct a Nikodym set in $F_q^d$ of cardinality $q^d - (\frac{d-2}{\log 2} +1+o(1)) q^{d-1} \log q$ in the limit $q \to \infty$, when $q$ is an odd prime power. This improves upon the naive random construction, which gives a set of cardinality $q^d - (d-1+o(1)) q^{d-1} \log q$, and is new in the regime where $F_q$ has unbounded characteristic and $q$ not a perfect square. While the final proofs are completely human generated, the initial ideas of the construction were inspired by output from the tools \texttt{AlphaEvolve} and \texttt{DeepThink}. We also present a simple construction of Nikodym sets in $F_q^2$ for $q$ a perfect square that is a special case of known unital-based constructions, and matches the existing bounds of $q^2 - q^{3/2} + O(q \log q)$, assuming that $q$ is not the square of a prime $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.</description>

      <title>Three formulas for CSM classes of open quiver loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the space of equioriented type $A$ quiver representations, we define subvarieties called "open quiver loci" by placing strict rank conditions on the maps within representations. The closures of these subvarieties are the quiver loci, whose equivariant cohomology classes are the quiver polynomials of Buch and Fulton. We present one geometric formula and two combinatorial formulas that compute equivariant Chern--Schwartz--MacPherson (CSM) classes of open quiver loci; these classes refine the data of the quiver polynomials. The second combinatorial formula is in terms of "chained generic pipe dreams," which modify the pipe dreams of Bergeron and Billey to more strongly resemble the lacing diagrams of Abeasis and Del Fra. We also present two new formulas for quiver polynomials; these are streamlined versions of known formulas due to Knutson, Miller, and Shimozono, in the sense that they contain fewer terms.</description>

      <title>On Universal Graphs for Trees and Tree-Like Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chung and Graham~[\textit{J.~London Math.\ Soc.\ }1983] claimed to prove that there exists an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\frac{5}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n)$ edges that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph. Frati, Hoffmann and T\'oth~[\textit{Combin.\ Probab.\ Comput.} 2023] discovered an error in the proof. By adding more edges to $G$ the error can be corrected, bringing the number of edges in $G$ to $\frac{7}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n). $
  We make the first improvement to Chung and Graham's bound in over four decades by showing that there exists an $n$-vertex graph with $\frac{14}{5}n \log_2 n + O(n) $ edges that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph.
  Furthermore, we generalise this bound for treewidth-$k$ graphs by showing that there exists a graph with $O(kn\log n)$ edges that contains every $n$-vertex treewidth-$k$ graph as a subgraph. This is best possible in the sense that $\Omega(kn\log{n})$ edges are required.</description>

      <title>Entropy Functions on Two-Dimensional Faces of Polymatroidal Region of Degree Four: Part I: Problem Formulation and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterization of entropy functions is of fundamental importance in information theory. By imposing constraints on their Shannon outer bound, i.e., the polymatroidal region, one obtains the faces of the region and entropy functions on them with special structures. In this series of two papers, we characterize entropy functions on the 2-dimensional faces of the polymatroidal region of degree 4. In Part I, we formulate the problem, enumerate all 59 types of 2-dimensional faces of the region by an algorithm, and fully characterize entropy functions on 49 types of them. Among them, those non-trivial cases are mainly characterized by the graph-coloring technique. The entropy functions on the remaining 10 types of faces will be characterized in Part II, among which 8 types are fully characterized, and 2 types are partially characterized.</description>

      <title>Map enumeration from a dynamical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This contribution summarizes recent work of the authors that combines methods from dynamical systems theory (discrete Painlev\'e equations) and asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomial recurrences, to address long-standing questions in map enumeration. Given a genus $g$, we present a framework that provides the generating function for the number of maps that can be realized on a surface of that genus. In the case of 4-valent maps, our methodology leads to explicit expressions for map counts. For general even or mixed valence, the number of vertices of the map specifies the relevant order of the derivatives of the generating function that needs to be considered. Beyond summarizing our own results, we provide context for the program highlighted in this article through a brief review of the literature describing advances in map enumeration. In addition, we discuss open problems and challenges related to this fascinating area of research that stands at the intersection of statistical physics, random matrices, orthogonal polynomials, and discrete dynamical systems theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ be the Liouville function, defined as $\lambda(n) := (-1)^{\Omega(n)}$ where $\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime factors of $n$ with multiplicity. In 2021, Helfgott and Radziwi{\l}{\l} proved that $$\sum_{n\leq x} \frac{1}{n} \lambda(n) \lambda(n+1) \ll \frac{\log x}{(\log \log x)^{1/2}},$$improving earlier results by Tao and Ter\"av\"ainen. We prove that $$\sum_{n\leq x} \frac{1}{n} \lambda(n) \lambda(n+1) \ll (\log x)^{1-c}$$for some absolute constant $c&gt;0$. This appears to be best possible with current methods.</description>

      <title>Counting the fission trees and nonabelian Hodge graphs (untwisted case)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any algebraic connection on a vector bundle on a smooth complex algebraic curve determines an irregular class and in turn a fission tree at each puncture. The fission trees are the discrete data classifying the admissible deformation classes. Here we explain how to count the fission trees with given slope and number of leaves, in the untwisted case. This also leads to a clearer picture of the ``periodic table'' of the atoms that play the role of building blocks in 2d gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally Markov walks are natural generalizations of classical Markov chains, where instead of a particle moving independently of the past, it decides where to move next depending on the last action performed at the current location. We introduce the concept of locally Markov walks and we describe their stationary distribution and recurrent states, and we prove several properties such as irreducibility and ergodicity. For a particular locally Markov walk - the uniform unicycle walk on the complete graph - we investigate the mixing time and we prove that it exhibits cutoff.</description>

      <title>Approximately Dominating Sets in Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condorcet's paradox is a fundamental result in social choice theory which states that there exist elections in which, no matter which candidate wins, a majority of voters prefer a different candidate. In fact, even if we can select any $k$ winners, there still may exist another candidate that would beat each of the winners in a majority vote. That is, elections may require arbitrarily large dominating sets.
  We show that approximately dominating sets of constant size always exist. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, every election (irrespective of the number of voters or candidates) can select $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2})$ winners such that no other candidate beats each of the winners by a margin of more than $\varepsilon$ fraction of voters.
  Our proof uses a simple probabilistic construction using samples from a maximal lottery, a well-studied distribution over candidates derived from the Nash equilibrium of a two-player game. In stark contrast to general approximate equilibria, which may require support logarithmic in the number of pure strategies, we show that maximal lotteries can be approximated with constant support size. These approximate maximal lotteries may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04248v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs. In particular, Cohen--Macaulay chordal graphs, clique corona graphs, and Cohen--Macaulay Cameron--Walker graphs are examples of clique-whiskered graphs. We also introduce multi-clique-whiskered graphs as a generalization of both clique-whiskered graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique-whiskered graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we provide formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of their edge ideals. Finally, we construct minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of both multi-clique-whiskered graphs and very well-covered graphs.</description>

Abstract: The Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD) graph is a random graph model with community structure and power-law distribution for both degrees and community sizes. The model generates graphs similar to the well-known LFR model but it is faster, more interpretable, and can be investigated analytically. In this paper, we use the underlying ingredients of the ABCD model, and its generalization to include outliers (ABCD+$o$), and introduce another variant that allows for overlapping communities, ABCD+$o^2$.</description>

      <title>Modularity from $q$-series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20316v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be mysteriously modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we answer the challenge. We use $q$-series algebra, first-order $q$-differential systems, and analytic continuation with monodromy to give a criterion that decides when such series are modular. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|&lt;1$ to form a vector-valued modular function without modular input, providing a clear path to modularity for strange $q$-series.</description>

      <title>Type II success runs of Bernoulli trials separated by a gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat success runs of independent identically distributed Bernoulli trials (with success parameter $p$) distributed according to the Type II binomial distribution of order $k$. However, the success runs are separated by a gap $g\ge1$ (a failure followed by $g-1$ arbitrary outcomes). Most of the literature treats the case $g=1$ only. Our main results are expressions for the probability mass function (we present two derivations) and the distribution of the longest success run. We also present more concise expressions for previously published results for the factorial moments. We present results for the mean, variance, probability mass function and factorial moments for $\textrm{NB}_{\rm II}(k,g,r)$, the Type II negative binomial distribution of order $k$, where the number of success runs $r$ is fixed and the number of trials $n$ is variable. Let $L$ denote the length of the longest success run. We present a recurrence and generating function for the distribution of $L$ and derive expressions for the mean, variance and factorial moments of $L$.</description>

Abstract: Classical spectral graph theory characterizes graphs with logarithmic mixing time. In this work, we present a combinatorial characterization of graphs with constant mixing time. The combinatorial characterization is based on the small-set bipartite density condition, which is weaker than having near-optimal spectral radius and is stronger than having near-optimal small-set vertex expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rooted products of graphs from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. For edge ideals, we introduce the 2-Cohen-Macaulayness with respect to a vertex and use it to investigate when edge ideals of rooted products of graphs are Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we completely determine when attaching a graph on at most six vertices to a given graph as rooted products, yields a Cohen-Macaulay edge ideal. Also, we define mulit-clique corona graphs as a generalization of clique-corona graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique corona graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. Also, we give formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.</description>
