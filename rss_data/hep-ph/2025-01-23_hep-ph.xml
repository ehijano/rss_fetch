      <title>Pulse and Polarization Structures in Axion-Converted X-rays from Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NS's) with their strong magnetic fields and hot dense cores could be powerful probes of axions, a classic benchmark of feebly-coupled new particles, through abundant production of axions with the axion-nucleon coupling and subsequent conversion into X-rays due to the axion-photon coupling. In this article, we point out that the pulsation structures in both the intensity and polarization of X-rays from NS's could provide us additional information about axions and their couplings. We develop new analytical formalisms of pulsation-polarization structure applicable to a wide range of NS's in the axion scenario and argue that they hold in complicated astrophysical environments. As a case study, we apply our formalism to a representative X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Star, RX J1856.6-3754, with an unexpected hard X-ray excess which might be axion-induced. We show with an updated fit that the axion explanation is compatible with both the intensity and pulsation data available. Yet the preferred parameter space is close to being excluded by other astrophysical constraints. With an achievable reduction of the uncertainties in the pulsation data, we could potentially draw a definite conclusion on the axion-induced X-rays.</description>

      <title>Probing Standard Model and Beyond with Reactor CE$\nu$NS Data of CONUS+ experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of reactor neutrino-induced Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) data from the CONUS+ experiment to investigate both Standard Model (SM) and Beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. Alongside CE$\nu$NS, elastic neutrino-electron scattering (E$\nu$ES) events are also included in our analysis, enabling more stringent constraints on new physics. Within the SM, we examine the weak mixing angle as a precision test of the electroweak sector. For BSM scenarios, we constrain the parameter space of light mediators arising from neutrino generalized interactions (NGI), while also setting limits on the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their charge radius, millicharge, and magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Probing conventional and new physics at the ESS with coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of the European Spallation Source (ESS) in probing physics within and beyond the Standard Model (SM), based on future measurements of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS). We consider two SM physics cases, namely the weak mixing angle and the nuclear radius. Regarding physics beyond the SM, we focus on neutrino generalized interactions (NGIs) and on various aspects of sterile neutrino and sterile neutral lepton phenomenology. For this, we explore the violation of lepton unitarity, active-sterile oscillations as well as interesting upscattering channels such as the sterile dipole portal and the production of sterile neutral leptons via NGIs. The projected ESS sensitivities are estimated by performing a statistical analysis considering the various CE$\nu$NS detectors and expected backgrounds. We find that the enhanced statistics achievable in view of the highly intense ESS neutrino beam, will offer a drastic improvement in the current constraints obtained from existing CE$\nu$NS measurements. Finally, we discuss how the ESS has the potential to provide the leading CE$\nu$NS-based constraints, complementing also further experimental probes and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Extending the Bridge Connecting Chiral Lagrangians and QCD Gaussian Sum-Rules for Low-Energy Hadronic Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has previously been demonstrated that the mesonic fields in chiral Lagrangians can be related to the quark-level operators of QCD sum-rules via energy-independent (constant) scale factor matrices constrained by chiral symmetry. This leads to universal scale factors for each type of chiral nonet related to quark-antiquark ($q\bar q$) operators and four-quark ($qq\bar q\bar q$) operators. Motivated by these successful demonstrations of scale-factor universality for the $K_0^*$ isodoublet and $a_0$ isotriplet scalar mesons, a revised Gaussian QCD sum-rule methodology is developed that enables the extension to higher-dimensional isospin sectors, including the possibility of mixing with glueball components. Moreover, to extract non-perturbative information about a resonance stemming from the final state interactions of its decay products, a background-resonance interference approximation is developed and shown to provide an excellent description of both $\pi K$ scattering amplitude data and $\pi\eta$ scattering calculations. This background-resonance interference approximation inspires new resonance models as ingredients in the scale-factor analysis connecting chiral Lagrangians and QCD Gaussian sum-rules. Using the revised Gaussian QCD sum-rule methodology, key properties of the scale factors are examined for the $K_0^*$ isodoublet and $a_0$ isotriplet scalar mesons for a sequence of increasingly sophisticated resonance models. Gaussian sum-rules are demonstrated to have sufficient resolution to distinguish between different resonance models, and it is shown that the background-resonance interference approximation not only describes $\{\pi K,\pi\eta\}$ scattering, but leads to the best universality and energy-independence properties of the scale factors.</description>

      <title>Constraints on flavor-dependent long-range interactions of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical neutrinos with energy in the TeV-PeV range traverse megaparsecs (Mpc) to gigaparsecs (Gpc) scale distances before they reach the Earth. Tiny physics effects that get accumulated over these large propagation paths during their journey may become observable at the detector. If there is some new interaction between neutrinos and the background matter, that can potentially affect the propagation of the astrophysical neutrinos. One such possible case is the flavor-dependent long-range interaction of neutrinos, which can affect the standard neutrino flavor transition, modifying the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrinos at Earth. Using the present-day and future projection of the flavor-composition measurements of IceCube and IceCube-Gen2 along with the present and future measurement of the oscillation parameters, we explore the sensitivity of these experiments to probe long-range neutrino interaction with matter.</description>

      <title>Laser induced Compton Scattering to Dark Matter in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of light dark matter (DM) is a longstanding challenge in terrestrial experiments. High-intensity facility of an intense electromagnetic field may provide a plausible strategy to study strong-field particle physics and search for light DM. In this work, we propose to search for light DM particle through the nonlinear Compton scattering in the presence of a high-intense laser field. An ultra-relativistic electron beam collides with an intense laser pulse of a number of optical photons and then decays to a pair of DM particles. We take into account the Dirac-type fermionic DM in leptophilic scenario and the DM-electron interactions in the framework of effective field theory. The decay rates of electron to a DM pair are calculated for effective DM operators of different bilinear products. We show the sensitivities of laser induced Compton scattering to the effective cutoff scale for DM lighter than 1 MeV and compare with direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>An introduction to effective potential methods in field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter we give a pedagogical introduction to effective potential methods in field theories. We first review the general functional methods leading to the concept of effective action and effective potential. Focusing on the effective potential we review the methods to compute radiative contributions, starting from the original 1973 seminal paper by Sidney Coleman and Erick Weinberg on one-loop corrections, along with its improvement by the renormalization group equations, as well as some basic results from thermal field theory, including the one-loop thermal corrections to the effective potential. We concentrate on some physical applications of the effective potential: i) the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking by radiative corrections, ii) the metastability of the electroweak vacuum in the Standard Model, and iii) the relevance of quantum effects in the dynamics of Higgs inflation. We then apply the previous results to cosmological phase transitions in the early universe and the possibility of generating a stochastic background of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Searching for compact pentaquark state within the bag model framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for the compact limit of multi-quark states is a challenging issue. Within the framework of the MIT bag model, we propose an effective limit bag radius of $R_{c} = 5.615 \, \text{GeV}^{-1}$(or $1.11 \, \text{fm}$) for bound states . When the bag radius of a hadron falls below this value, the bag binding energy satisfies $E_{B} &lt; 0$, indicating that the system has a compact intention. We consider various combinations of different numbers and ratios of heavy and light quarks, indicating that the bag radius of hadrons depending on the number of quarks is suppressed by the presence of heavy quarks. Focusing on five-quark combinations, we find that the average bag radius of $nncc\bar{c}$ is below the threshold $R_{c}$. We take into account color-magnetic interactions and calculate the mass, magnetic moment, binding energy, and relative strong decay width for the $nnQQ\bar{Q}$ system. We show that the binding energies of most states in the flavor combination $nncc\bar{c}$ are approximately $-20 \, \text{MeV}$, whereas states involving bottom quarks have binding energies around $-120 \, \text{MeV}$, with some decay widths suppressed by the decay constant. Additionally, the $nQQQ\bar{Q}$ system exhibits even deeper binding. Our results support the compact intention of $nnQQ\bar{Q}$ and suggest that the $nQQQ\bar{Q}$ configuration demonstrates even stronger compactness.</description>

      <title>Single spin asymmetry in forward $pA$ collisions from Pomeron-Odderon interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working in the hybrid framework of the high energy $pA$ collisions we identify a new contribution to transverse single spin asymmetry (SSA). The phase necessary for the SSA is provided by the Pomeron-Odderon interference in the dense nuclear target. The complete formula for the $pA \to h X$ polarized cross section also contains the transversity distribution for the polarized projectile as well as the real part of the twist-3 fragmentation function. We numerically estimate the asymmetry $A_N$ and its nuclear dependence. Based on a model computation we find that $A_N$ can be a percent level in the forward and low-$P_{h\perp}$ region. For large nuclei we find significant suppression, with $A_N \propto A^{-7/6}$ parametrically. As a notable feature we find a node of $A_N$ as a function of the $P_{h\perp}$ around the values of the initial saturation scale that could be used to test this mechanism experimentally.</description>

      <title>Predicting the QCD critical point and EoS from combining HIC and neutron star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combined constraint on the dense QCD equation of state from connecting neutron star observations to data from heavy ion reactions is presented. We use the Chiral Mean Field Model which can describe neutron star and iso-spin symmetric matter and allows the consistent calculation of the density and momentum dependent potentials of baryons which are then implemented in the UrQMD transport model. In contrast to previous studies, the same equation of state constrained from neutron star properties is also able to describe experimental observables in heavy ion reactions at the HADES experiment.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $\Lambda_c \to (\Lambda,n)\ell^+ \nu_\ell $ Decays in Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the decays $\Lambda_c \to (\Lambda, n) \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ ($\ell = \mu, e$) within a model-independent framework. We calculate the helicity amplitudes for all possible four-fermion operators, including the interactions between different new physics (NP) operators. The form factors for the $\Lambda_c \to (\Lambda, n)$ transitions are taken from lattice QCD calculations. We present detailed results for the branching fractions and other key observables. Although our results are generally consistent with previous studies, we find that the predicted central values for the branching fractions are approximately $10\%$ larger than the experimental measurements. Additionally, we explore the potential impacts of NP, focusing particularly on the scenario in which NP particles couple exclusively to the muon. Using Wilson coefficients fitted from $D$ and $D_s$ meson decays, we examine NP effects in the $\Lambda_c \to (\Lambda, n) \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ decay channels. It is found that although most potential contributions of NP are obscured by the uncertainties inherent in both theory and experiment, the right-handed scalar operator could suppress the branching fraction of $\Lambda_c \to (\Lambda, n) \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ by up to $10\%$. We also highlight that the ratio of the forward-backward asymmetry in the $\Lambda_c \to (\Lambda, n) \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ decay to that in the $\Lambda_c \to (\Lambda, n) e^+ \nu_e$ decay provides a novel probe for NP, as it is less sensitive to hadronic uncertainties and is largely unaffected by current NP operators. All of our results can be tested in ongoing experiments such as BESIII, Belle-II, and LHCb, as well as in future high-energy facilities like the Super Tau-Charm Factory (STCF) and the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC).</description>

      <title>The QCD Equation of State with $N_f=3$ flavours up to the electro-weak scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Equation of State of Quantum Chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavours is determined non-perturbatively in the range of temperatures between $3$ and $165$ GeV with a precision of about $0.5$-$1.0\%$. The calculation is carried out by numerical simulations of lattice gauge theory discretized \`a la Wilson with shifted boundary conditions in the compact direction. At each given temperature the entropy density is computed at several lattice spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. Taken at face value, data point straight to the Stefan-Boltzmann value by following a linear behaviour in the strong coupling constant squared. They are also compatible with the known perturbative formula supplemented by higher order terms in the coupling constant, a parameterization which describes well our data together with those present in the literature down to $500$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Tagging Efficiency Study of Incoherent Diffractive Vector Meson Production at the Second Interaction Region at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is an upcoming accelerator facility aimed at exploring the properties of quarks and gluons in nucleons and nuclei, shedding light on their structure and dynamics. The inaugural experimental apparatus, ePIC (electron-Proton and Ion Collider), is designed as a general purpose detector to address the NAS/NSAC physics program at the EIC. The wider EIC community is strongly supporting a second interaction region and associated second detector to enhance the full science program. In this study, we evaluate how the second interaction region and detector can be complementary to ePIC. The pre-conceptual layout of an interaction region for the second detector offers a secondary focus that provides better forward detector acceptance at scattering angles near $\theta \sim 0$~mrad, which can specifically enhance the exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics program. This article presents an analysis of a tagging program using the second interaction region layout with incoherent diffractive vector meson production. The potential for the second interaction region to provide improved vetoing capabilities for incoherent events to elucidate the coherent diffractive cross-section is evaluated. The capability to access the coherent diffractive cross-section is of prime importance for studying the spatial imaging of nucleons and nuclei.</description>

      <title>Extending Israel-Stewart theory: Causal bulk viscosity at large gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of relativistic fluid models for cold and dense matter with bulk viscosity, whose equilibrium equation of state is polytropic. These models reduce to Israel-Stewart theory for small values of the viscous stress $\Pi$. However, when $\Pi$ becomes comparable to the equilibrium pressure $P$, the evolution equations "adjust" to prevent the onset of far-from-equilibrium pathologies that would otherwise plague Israel-Stewart. Specifically, the equations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along any continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state space. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the hydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities). The second law of thermodynamics is enforced exactly. Near equilibrium, these models can accommodate an arbitrarily complicated dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$ on both density and temperature.</description>

Abstract: The nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains mysterious despite the substantial evidence from astrophysical and cosmological observations. While the majority of DM in our universe is non-relativistic, collisionless and its equation of state (EoS) is approximately pressureless $p\simeq 0$, DM becomes relativistic near the massive black holes in galactic center. Yet its EoS is seldom discussed in the relativistic regime. Here we initially explore the possible equation of state for DM in the vicinity of Schwarzschild black holes. We work in a spherical and quasi-static background spacetime, and describe DM as a perfect fluid in equilibrium. Through numerically solving the TOV equations with physical boundary conditions, we show that DM can have static profiles near black holes and its pressure should be negative in order to support the viable density profiles $\rho$. We illustrate with two simple general equations of state, namely the power law $p \propto \rho^\gamma$ and the radius-dependent $p \propto r\cdot \rho$, and compare them with the observations of the Milky Way. Our findings provide insights into the model-building of DM, which should incorporate the possibility of negative pressure in the relativistic regime around black holes.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytic model for decaying dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) affects the evolution of cosmic structure relative to standard cold, collisionless, stable dark matter (CDM). We introduce a new semi-analytic model for the effects of two-body DDM on halo structure and subhalo populations. In this scenario, cold parent dark matter particles decay into less massive daughter particles plus dark radiation with a lifetime comparable to the age of the universe. Our DDM model is implemented in the open-source software $\texttt{Galacticus}$ and accounts for heating (due to the velocity kicks imparted on daughter particles) and mass loss (due to the parent--daughter mass splitting). We show that decays flatten and reduce the amplitude of halos' inner density profiles. These effects make DDM subhalos susceptible to tidal disruption, which we show yields a mass-dependent suppression of the subhalo mass function relative to CDM. Our predictions for DDM density profiles, velocity dispersion profiles, and subhalo populations are consistent with results from isolated and cosmological DDM N-body simulations. Thus, our model enables efficient and accurate exploration of DDM parameter space and will be useful for deriving constraints from upcoming small-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic QCD Study of Excited Bottomonia at Finite Temperatures on a Fine Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temperature dependence of bottomonium correlators up to the 3S and 3P excited states are presented in the range $T \simeq 133-250$ MeV. These lattice calculations employ the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) approach for bottom quarks on (2+1)-flavor gauge backgrounds, using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action near the physical point. The study utilizes a fine lattice spacing of 0.0493 fm at all temperatures. Extended bottomonium operators are implemented to achieve optimized overlaps with the targeted excited states, enhancing sensitivity to thermal effects. To probe in-medium modifications of excited bottomonia, we extract thermal widths and in-medium masses from bottomonium correlators, parameterizing the spectral function with a Gaussian ansatz. Our results confirm nonzero thermal widths for various bottomonium states as the temperature increases, while no significant mass shifts are observed. Additionally, we check that the in-medium properties of bottomonia are almost not affected by variations in the choice of extended operators.</description>

      <title>Enhancing charge ratio sensitivity to hadronization effects via jet selections on resolved SoftDrop splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at ultra-relativistic energies can be performed in a controlled environment through lepton-hadron deep inelastic scatterings. In such collisions, the high-energy partonic emissions that follow from the ejected hard partons are accurately described by perturbative QCD. However, the lower energy scales at which quarks and gluons experience colour confinement, i.e. hadronization mechanism, fall outside the validity regions for perturbative calculations, requiring phenomenological models tuned to data to describe it. As such, hadronization physics cannot be currently derived from first principles alone. Monte Carlo event generators are useful tools to describe these processes as they simulate both the perturbative and the non-perturbative interactions, with model-dependent energy scales that control parton dynamics. This work employs jets - experimental reconstructions of final-state particles likely to have a common partonic origin - to inspect this transition further. Although originally proposed to circumvent hadronization effects, we show that jets can be utilised as probes of non-perturbative phenomena via their substructure. The charge correlation ratio was recently shown to be sensitive to hadronization effects. Our work further improves this sensitivity to non-perturbative scales by introducing a new selection based on the relative placement of the \textit{resolved SoftDrop splitting} within the clustering tree, defined as the unclustering that resolves the jet's leading charged particles.</description>

      <title>Smooth $\mu$-Hybrid and Non-Minimal Higgs Inflation in $SU(4)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}$ With Observable Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to study a smooth variant of the $\mu$-hybrid inflation model and a non-minimal Higgs model of inflation with quartic non-minimal coupling between the Higgs field and gravity within the context of a realistic GUT gauge group based on supersymmetric $SU(4)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}$. These models are incorporated with a realistic scenario of reheating and non-thermal leptogenesis, compatible with the constraints from the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Notably, both models successfully address the MSSM $\mu$-problem and avoid the issue of primordial magnetic monopoles. Our analysis reveals that both models predict a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that closely aligns with the central observationally favored value of Planck2018 + BICEP2/Keck Array (BK15) data and yield a large tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r &gt; 10^{-3}$), potentially detectable in forthcoming CMB experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with modified entanglement receive corrections.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar and vector tetraquarks $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar and vector four-quark states $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ are studied in the context of the QCD sum rule method. We model $T_{\mathrm{ \ \ PS}} $ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ as structures built of diquarks $ b^{T}C\gamma_{5}b$, $\overline{c}C\overline{c}^{T}$ and $b^{T}C\gamma _{5}b$ , $\overline{c}C\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\overline{c}^{T}$, respectively, with $ C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The spectroscopic parameters of the tetraquarks $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$, i.e., their masses and current couplings are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. We evaluate the full widths of $T_{\mathrm{PS}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ by taking into account their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the pseudoscalar particle they are processes $T_{\mathrm{PS}} \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{3}P_{0})$ and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. The vector state $T_{\mathrm{V}}$ can dissociate to meson pairs $2 B_{c}^{-}$, $2 B_{c}^{\ast -}$ and $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}(1^{1}P_{1})$. Partial widths of these decays are determined by the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices, which evaluated in the context of the three-point sum rule approach. Predictions obtained for the mass and full width of the pseudoscalar $m =(13.092\pm 0.095)~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma _{\mathrm{PS} }=(63.7\pm 13.0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and vector $\widetilde{m} =(13.15\pm 0.10)~ \mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{V}}=(53.5\pm 10.3)~\mathrm{MeV}$ tetraquarks can be useful for analyses of different four-quark resonances.</description>

      <title>FastEEC: Fast Evaluation of N-point Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy correlators characterize the asymptotic energy flow in scattering events produced at colliders, from which the microscopic physics of the scattering can be deduced. This view of collisions is akin to analyses of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and a range of promising phenomenological applications of energy correlators have been identified, including the study of hadronization, the deadcone effect, measuring $\alpha_s$ and the top quark mass. While $N$-point energy correlators are interesting to study for larger values of $N$, their evaluation is computationally intensive, scaling like $M^N/N!$, where $M$ is the number of particles. In this Letter, we develop a fast, approximate method for their evaluation exploiting that correlations at a given angular scale are insensitive to effects at other (widely-separated) scales. This implies that the energy correlator can be computed on (sub)jets, effectively reducing M. Furthermore, we utilize a dynamical (sub)jet radius that allows us to obtain reliable results without restricting the angular scales being probed. For concreteness we focus on the projected energy correlator, which projects onto the largest separation between the $N$ directions. E.g.~for $N=7$ we find a speed up of up to four orders of magnitude, depending on the desired accuracy. We also consider the possibility of raising the energy to a power higher than one in the energy correlator, which has been proposed to reduce soft sensitivity, and further cuts back the required computation time. These higher-power correlators are not collinear safe, but as a byproduct our approach suggests a natural method to regularize them, such that they can be described using perturbation theory. This letter is accompanied by a public code that implements our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel realisation of leptogenesis that relies on the out-of-equilibrium decay of an axion-like particle (ALP) into right-handed Majorana neutrinos (RHNs) in the early Universe. With respect to standard thermal leptogenesis, our mechanism lowers by two orders of magnitude the RHN mass, or the tuning in the RHN mass splittings, needed to reproduce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and neutrino masses. We find that ALP leptogenesis requires $m_a &gt; 10^{4}$ GeV and $f_a &gt; 10^{11}$ GeV for the ALP mass and decay constant, and predicts an early period of matter domination induced by the ALP in parts of its parameter space. We finally provide a viable supersymmetric realisation of ALP leptogenesis where the ALP is the $R$-axion, which accommodates GeV gravitino dark matter and predicts RHN below 10 TeV.</description>

      <title>Non-universal probes of composite Higgs models: New bounds and prospects for FCC-ee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the leading loop-level phenomenology of composite Higgs models via the effective field theory of a strongly interacting light Higgs and top quark (SILH+TQ). We systematically analyze the renormalization group evolution (RGE) of tree-generated operators in the SILH+TQ scenario, finding large mixings of flavor non-universal operators into those affecting electroweak precision observables. We show that these model-independent RG contributions are more important than typical estimates for finite matching terms. Flavor non-universal effects are completely captured by examining three options for the top mixing: fully composite $q_L^3$, equal compositeness, and fully composite $t_R$. In the most phenomenologically viable case of a fully composite $t_R$, we show that the strongest bound on the natural parameter space comes from a 2-loop double-log contribution of the 4-top operator $O_{tt} = (\bar t_R \gamma_\mu t_R)(\bar t_R \gamma^\mu t_R)$ into the Peskin-Takeuchi $T$ parameter. In general, we find that this 2-loop effect allows existing electroweak precision data to give better constraints on 4-top operators than high-energy probes from top production at the LHC. Independent of the top mixing, we find that a future tera-$Z$ machine such as FCC-ee has the potential to probe composite Higgs models up to a scale of $m_* \gtrsim 25$ TeV, and test the naturalness of the electroweak scale at the $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ level.</description>

Abstract: We develop a machine learning method for mapping data originating from both Standard Model processes and various theories beyond the Standard Model into a unified representation (latent) space while conserving information about the relationship between the underlying theories. We apply our method to three examples of new physics at the LHC of increasing complexity, showing that models can be clustered according to their LHC phenomenology: different models are mapped to distinct regions in latent space, while indistinguishable models are mapped to the same region. This opens interesting new avenues on several fronts, such as model discrimination, selection of representative benchmark scenarios, and identifying gaps in the coverage of model space.</description>

Abstract: We assess the potential of neutrino telescopes to discover quantum-gravity-induced decoherence effects modeled in the open-quantum system framework and with arbitrary numbers of active and dark fermion generations, such as particle dark matter or sterile neutrinos. The expected damping of neutrino flavor oscillation probabilities as a function of energy and propagation length thus encodes information about quantum gravity effects and the fermion generation multiplicity in the dark sector. We employ a public Monte-Carlo dataset provided by the IceCube Collaboration to model the detector response and estimate the sensitivity of IceCube to oscillation effects in atmospheric neutrinos induced by the presented model. Our findings confirm the potential of very-large-volume neutrino telescopes to test this class of models and indicate higher sensitivities for increasing numbers of dark fermions.</description>

Abstract: We study the $P$-wave bottom baryons of the $SU(3)$ flavor $\mathbf{\bar3}_F$ and systematically calculate their strong decay properties, including their $D$-wave decays into ground-state bottom baryons with light pseudoscalar mesons and $S$-wave decays into ground-state bottom baryons with light vector mesons. Together with Refs.~\cite{Tan:2023opd,Yang:2019cvw,Yang:2020zrh,Luo:2024jov}, a rather complete investigation has been performed to study their mass spectra and strong/radiative decay properties, through the methods of QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. Among various possibilities, we identify four $\Lambda_b$ and four $\Xi_b$ baryons, with limited decay widths and so capable of being observed in experiments. Their masses, mass splittings within the same multiplets, and strong/radiative decay widths are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:decayb3f} for future experimental searching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lepton flavor universality violations in semileptonic $b \to c$ transitions have garnered attention over a decade. For $R_{H_c}={\rm{BR}}(H_b\to H_c \tau\bar\nu_\tau)/{\rm{BR}}(H_b\to H_c \ell\bar\nu_\ell)$ with $\ell$ being $e,\, \mu$, a sum rule among $R_{D}$, $R_{D^*}$ and $R_{\Lambda_c}$ was proposed to check consistency in the experimental results independently of new physics models. We revisit this relation from the perspective of the heavy quark symmetry. We derive a sum rule holding exactly in the heavy quark limit and clarify how model-dependent corrections are introduced in a realistic situation.</description>

Abstract: We extend our prior results on the worldline computation of the axial vector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) to the finite mass case by computing in addition the pseudoscalar-vector-vector (PVV) triangle graph. For the well-studied QED case, we show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical PVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral condensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the massless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a primordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\bar \eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten coupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical $\eta^\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by $O(10\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic expression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that the proton's net quark helicity $\Delta \Sigma\propto \sqrt{\chi_{\rm QCD}' |_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral limit, and show they are of the order of a few percent. Our prior prediction that the polarized DIS structure function $g_1$ is quenched by sphaleron-like topological transitions at small $x$ is unaffected by quark mass effects. Our results illustrate how worldline computations of anomalous processes, in synergy with lattice computations and nonet chiral perturbation theory, can uncover novel nonperturbative features of QCD at the Electron-Ion collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we highlight physics improvements in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The upcoming version of NuWro will incorporate the integration of the argon spectral function for quasi-elastic scattering, along with the MINER$\nu$A parametrization of the axial form factor. Additionally, the new release will feature the implementation of the Valencia 2020 model for meson exchange current. The previously used simplistic delta resonance model for single-pion production will be replaced by a more accurate Ghent hybrid model in the upcoming version of NuWro. We also discuss the recent advancements made by the Wroclaw Neutrino Group in applying machine-learning techniques to achieve model-independent reconstruction of lepton-nucleus interactions</description>

      <title>Muon-specific two-Higgs-doublet model for $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, $W$-boson mass-shift, and Zee model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated one type of 2HDM, the muon-specific two-Higgs-doublet model, as a solution to the muon ($g-2$) and CDF $W$-boson mass anomaly. The additional Higgs boson couplings to muons are enhanced by $\tan \beta$, while the couplings to other fermions are suppressed by $\cot \beta$. One-loop corrections to the $W-\mu-\nu_\mu$ coupling induce a positive shift to the $W$-boson mass, compatible with the CDF measurement. Fixing the charged Higgs mass of $m_{H^\pm}=600$ GeV, our results show that small values of $\tan \beta$ ($\approx 200$) require a large mass splitting of $m_A-m_H \approx 480$ GeV. The small mass splitting case $m_A-m_H \approx 10$ GeV is also possible, provided large $\tan \beta$ ($\approx 5000$). The oblique parameter lies in $T=[0.126,0.198]$ which corresponds to the mass-splitting between the charged and pseudoscalar Higgs in the range typically $10-100$ GeV. This leads to the constrained all Higgs boson masses that cannot be heavier than about 600 GeV. At the end, we also have studied the model in the context of the Zee model, radiative neutrino mass generation at one-loop level, by adding a singly-charged scalar to the model. The model results in the incompatible neutrino mass matrix with solar and KamLAND data.</description>

      <title>Power corrections in the quark-antiquark potential at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:hep-ph/0702055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently proposed phenomenological model, which includes nonperturbative effects from dimension two gluon condensates, is applied to analyze the available lattice data for the heavy quark free energy in the deconfined phase of quenched QCD. For large $q\bar{q}$ separations, we recover previous results for the Polyakov loop, exhibiting unequivocal power corrections in the temperature. For the $q\bar{q}$ potential at finite temperature and finite separation, we find that a good overall description of the lattice data can be achieved once the condensate is properly accounted for. In addition, the model predicts a duality between the zero temperature potential as a function of the $q\bar{q}$ separation, on the one hand, and the quark selfenergy as a function of the temperature, on the other, which turns out to be satisfied to a high degree by the lattice data.</description>

Abstract: We present a new inference framework for neutron star astrophysics based on conditional variational autoencoders. Once trained, the generator block of the model reconstructs the neutron star equation of state from a given set of mass-radius observations. While the pressure of dense matter is the focus of the present study, the proposed model is flexible enough to accommodate the reconstructing of any other quantity related to dense matter equation of state. Our results show robust reconstructing performance of the model, allowing to make instantaneous inference from any given observation set.</description>

      <title>Testing an oscillatory behavior of dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this work is to use a model-independent approach, along with late-time observational probes, to reconstruct the dark energy (DE) equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(z)$. Our analysis showed that, for a late time universe, $w_{\rm DE}$ deviates from being a constant but in contrast exhibits an oscillatory behavior, hence both quintessence ($w_{\rm DE}&gt; -1$) and phantom ($w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$) regimes are equally allowed. In order to portray this oscillatory behavior, we explored various parametrizations for the equation of state and identified the closest approximation based on the goodness of fit with the data and the Bayesian evidence analysis. Our findings indicated that while all considered oscillating DE parametrizations provided a better fit to the data, compared to the cosmological constant, they are penalized in the Bayesian evidence analysis due to the additional free parameters. Overall, the present article demonstrates that in the low redshift regime, the equation of state of the DE prefers to be dynamical and oscillating. We anticipate that future cosmological probes will take a stand in this direction.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early universe and in particle colliders, starting from the Standard Model. Classical-computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss's laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in 1+1 dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system's entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>The LISA forecast on a smooth crossover beyond the Standard Model through the scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supposing the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave (GW) detector, we exhibit the detectability of a hypothetical smooth crossover in the early universe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics through the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) in terms of the Fisher forecast. A crossover at $\sim100\,\mathrm{TeV}$ can leave a signal on the GW spectrum in the $\sim\mathrm{mHz}$ frequency range, the sweet spot of the LISA sensitivity. These possibilities are also interesting in the primordial black hole (PBH) context as the associated PBH mass $\sim10^{22}\,\mathrm{g}$ lies at the window to explain the whole dark matter. We found that the properties of the crossover can be well determined if the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations are as large as $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ on the corresponding scale $\sim10^{12}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic superstrings, metastable strings and ultralight primordial black holes: from NANOGrav to LIGO and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While topologically stable cosmic strings are disfavoured by the recent observation of nHz stochastic gravitational waves (GW) by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), e.g., NANOGrav, cosmic metastable strings and superstrings are not. However, because the gravitational waves from all classes of strings generally span a wide range of frequencies, they contradict LIGO's non-observation of stochastic gravitational waves at the $f\sim $ 25 Hz band for a substantial string-parameter space favoured by the PTA data. Suppose ultralight primordial black holes ($M_{\rm BH}&lt;10^9$ g) existed in the early universe. In this case, they reduce the amplitude of the GWs at higher frequencies by providing an early matter-dominated phase, alleviating the tension between LIGO observation and PTA data. We show that the recent PTA data complemented by future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) runs plus detectors such as LISA and ET would be able to dapple the properties and further search strategies of such ultralight primordial black holes which are otherwise fairly elusive as they evaporate in the early universe by Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, 5 of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

Abstract: We present a neural network classification model for detecting the presence of hyperonic degrees of freedom in neutron stars. The models take radii and/or tidal deformabilities as input and give the probability for the presence of hyperons in the neutron star composition. Different numbers of observations and different levels of uncertainty in the neutron star properties are tested. The models have been trained on a dataset of well-calibrated microscopic equations of state of neutron star matter based on a relativistic mean-field formalism. Real data and data generated from a different description of hyperonic matter are used to test the performance of the models.</description>

      <title>Lyman Alpha Forest - Halo Cross-Correlations in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a perturbative effective field theory (EFT) description for anisotropic (redshift-space) correlations between the Lyman alpha forest and a generic biased tracer of matter, which could be represented by quasars, high-redshift galaxies, or dark matter halos. We compute one-loop EFT power spectrum predictions for the combined analysis of the Lyman alpha and biased tracers' data and test them on the publicly available high fidelity Sherwood simulations. We use massive and light dark matter halos at redshift $z=2.8$ as proxies for quasars and high-redshift galaxies, respectively. In both cases, we demonstrate that our EFT model can consistently describe the complete data vector consisting of the Lyman alpha forest auto spectrum, the halo auto spectrum, and the Lyman alpha -- halo cross spectrum. We show that the addition of cross-correlations significantly sharpens constraints on EFT parameters of the Lyman alpha forest and halos. In the combined analysis, our EFT model fits the simulated cross-spectra with a percent level accuracy at $k_{\rm max}= 1~h$Mpc$^{-1}$, which represents a significant improvement over previous analytical models. Thus, our work provides precision theoretical tools for full-shape analyses of Lyman alpha - quasar cross-correlations with ongoing and upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles through the gamma-ray production from cosmic-ray scattering in the Milky Way dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALP) are promising candidates to comprise all the dark matter in the universe. We investigate the ALP couplings to photons and electrons via astrophysical measurements through the search for very-high-energy gamma rays arising from high-energy cosmic-ray scattering off ALP populating the halo of the Milky Way. We show that gamma-ray signals from ALP couplings to photons and electrons via inverse Primakoff and Compton processes respectively, can be probed by very-high-energy ($\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray ground-based observatories, providing an alternative and complementary avenue to probe ALP couplings in the eV mass range. Sensitivities of current and near-future ground-based gamma-ray observatories improves upon one order of magnitude the current constraints from gamma-ray satellite experiments for the ALP-photon couplings in the region of masses below 10$^{-9}$ GeV. Their sensitivities reached on the ALP-electron couplings allow probing masses below 10$^{-8}$ GeV, which are lower than the masses probed in gamma-ray satellite experiments.</description>
