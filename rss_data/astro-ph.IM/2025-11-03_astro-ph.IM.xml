      <title>jFoF: GPU Cluster Finding with Gradient Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present jFoF, a fully GPU-native Friends-of-Friends (FoF) halo finder designed for both high-performance simulation analysis and differentiable modeling. Implemented in JAX, jFoF achieves end-to-end acceleration by performing all neighbor searches, label propagation, and group construction directly on GPUs, eliminating costly host--device transfers. We introduce two complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/bhorowitz/jFOF/.</description>

      <title>IrisML: Neural Posterior Estimation for the Spectral Energy Distribution fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 30 years, numerous large-scale photometric astronomical surveys have been conducted, including SDSS, Pan-STARRS, Gaia,2MASS, WISE, and others. These surveys provide extensive photometric measurements that can be used to infer a wide range of physical parameters of astronomical objects. Traditionally, Bayesian approaches, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling have been employed for such inference tasks. However, these methods tend to be computationally intensive and often require manual tuning or expert supervision. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning model designed to perform automatic and robust inference from photometric data, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshifts in JWST Deep Fields: A Pixel-Based Alternative with DeepDISC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-z algorithms that utilize SED template fitting have matured, and are widely adopted for use on high-redshift near-infrared data that provides a unique window into the early universe. Alternative photo-z methods have been developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting (lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched. Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating caveats.</description>

      <title>SERVIMON: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance and Real-Time Monitoring for Astronomical Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: ServiMon is designed to offer a scalable and intelligent pipeline for data collection and auditing to monitor distributed astronomical systems such as the ASTRI Mini-Array. The system enhances quality control, predictive maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods: ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana, Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage, minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally, ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management. Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Moonlit sky polarization patterns from Cerro Paranal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization patterns from the moonlit sky as observed from the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal. The moonlit sky background can be significant in astronomical observations and thus be a source of contamination in polarimetric studies. Based on sky observations during full Moon with FORS2 in imaging polarimetric mode, we measure the polarization degree and intensity at different wavelengths and scattering angles from the Moon, and compare them to theoretical and phenomenological single and multiple scattering models. Single scattering Rayleigh models are able to reproduce the wavelength dependence of the polarization as long as strong depolarization factors that increase with wavelength are introduced. Intensity data, however, require the inclusion of single Mie scattering from larger aerosol particles. The best models that simultaneously fit polarization and intensity data, are a combination of both single scattering processes, Rayleigh and Mie, plus an unpolarized multiple scattering component. Both Mie and multiple scattering become more dominant at longer wavelengths. Other factors like cloud depolarization and the sunlight contribution during the twilight were also investigated. The present study underscores the importance of accounting for moonlight scattering to enhance the accuracy of polarimetric observations of astronomical targets.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Maps with the Theory of Functional Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poincar\'e maps play a fundamental role in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory, offering a means to reduce the dimensionality of continuous dynamical systems by tracking the intersections of trajectories with lower-dimensional section surfaces. Traditional approaches typically rely on numerical integration and interpolation to detect these crossings, which can lead to inaccuracies and computational inefficiencies. This work presents a novel methodology for constructing Poincar\'e maps based on the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC). The constrained functionals produced by TFC yield continuous and differentiable representations of system trajectories that exactly satisfy prescribed constraints. The computation of Poincar\'e maps is formulated as either an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary value problem (BVP). For IVPs, initial conditions are embedded into the functional, and the intersection time with a specified section surface is determined. We demonstrate linear convergence to the Taylor series, thereby enabling accurate interpolation without resorting to numerical integration or external optimization. For BVPs, periodicity conditions are encoded to identify periodic orbits in a Three-Body Problem context. Furthermore, by enforcing periodic constraints, we show how to construct first recurrence maps. The methodology is also extended to non-autonomous systems, demonstrated through applications to a Four-Body Problem. The proposed approach achieves machine-level accuracy with modest computational effort, eliminating the need for variable transformations or iterative integration schemes with adaptive step-sizing. The results illustrate that TFC offers a powerful and efficient alternative framework for constructing Poincar\'e maps, computing periodic orbits, and analyzing complex dynamical systems, particularly in astrodynamical contexts.</description>

      <title>Systematic Absence of Low-Confidence Nighttime Fire Detections in VIIRS Active Fire Product: Evidence of Undocumented Algorithmic Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire product is widely used for global fire monitoring, yet its confidence classification scheme exhibits an undocumented systematic pattern. Through analysis of 21,540,921 fire detections spanning one year (January 2023 - January 2024), I demonstrate a complete absence of low-confidence classifications during nighttime observations. Of 6,007,831 nighttime fires, zero were classified as low confidence, compared to an expected 696,908 under statistical independence (chi-squared = 1,474,795, p &lt; 10^-15, Z = -833). This pattern persists globally across all months, latitude bands, and both NOAA-20 and Suomi-NPP satellites. Machine learning reverse-engineering (88.9% accuracy), bootstrap simulation (1,000 iterations), and spatial-temporal analysis confirm this is an algorithmic constraint rather than a geophysical phenomenon. Brightness temperature analysis reveals nighttime fires below approximately 295K are likely excluded entirely rather than flagged as low-confidence, while daytime fires show normal confidence distributions. This undocumented behavior affects 27.9% of all VIIRS fire detections and has significant implications for fire risk assessment, day-night detection comparisons, confidence-weighted analyses, and any research treating confidence levels as uncertainty metrics. I recommend explicit documentation of this algorithmic constraint in VIIRS user guides and reprocessing strategies for affected analyses.</description>

      <title>Scattered light noise due to dust particles contamination in the vacuum pipes of the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-sensitivity optical measurements such as those performed in interferometric gravitational wave detectors are prone to scattered light noise. To minimize it, optical components must meet tight requirements on surface roughness and bulk defects. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these measures can be undermined by other sources of scattered light. In this article, we examine scattered light noise caused by particles deposited on surfaces, especially on the baffles inside the vacuum pipes of the Einstein Telescope's interferometer arms. First, we study light scattering by particles deposited on a surface and having diameters from about one tenth to hundred times the light wavelength: we discuss its angular distribution and dependence on particle size and refractive index, and on polarization. Then, we specialize to the case of the Einstein Telescope arms and quantify the maximum allowed density of particles on each arm baffle. We conclude with cleanliness guidelines for the assembly of the vacuum pipes, including the required cleanliness class of the installation environment.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Birefringence in Highly-reflective Substrate-Transferred GaAs/Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As Coatings at 1064 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a custom-built scanning system, we generated maps of birefringence on reflection at $\lambda=1064$~nm from single-crystal GaAs/Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As Bragg reflectors (henceforth ``AlGaAs coatings''). Ten coatings were bonded to fused silica substrates and one remained on the epitaxial growth wafer. The average phase difference on reflection between beams polarized along the fast and slow axes of the coating was found to be $\psi = 1.09 \pm 0.18$~mrad, consistent with values observed in high-finesse optical reference cavities using similar AlGaAs coatings. Scans of substrate-transferred coatings with diameters between 18 and 194 millimeters showed birefringence non-uniformity at a median level of $0.1$~mrad. A similar epitaxial multilayer that was not substrate transferred, but remained on the growth wafer, had by far the least birefringence non-uniformity of all mirrors tested at $0.02$~mrad. On the other hand, the average birefringence of the epi-on-wafer coating and substrate-transferred coatings was indistinguishable. Excluding non-uniformity found at the location of crystal and bonding defects, we conclude that the observed non-uniformity was imparted during the substrate transfer process, likely during bonding. Quantifying the impact on the scatter loss in a LIGO-like interferometer, we find that birefringence non-uniformity at the levels seen here is unlikely to have a significant impact on performance. Nonetheless, future efforts will focus on improved process control to minimize and ultimately eliminate the observed non-uniformity.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Spectroscopic Flux Variations Between JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec: Slit Losses in Emission Line Measurements of z$\sim$1-3 Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopic observations in the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster field. From approximately 120 candidates, we identify 12 objects with at least a prominent emission lines among \Oii, \Hb, \Oiiia, \Oiiib, and \Ha that are spectroscopically confirmed by both instruments. Our key findings reveal systematic differences between the two spectrographs based on source morphology and shutter aperture placement. Compact objects show comparable or higher integrated flux in NIRSpec relative to NIRISS (within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties), while extended sources consistently display higher flux in NIRISS measurements. This pattern reflects NIRSpec's optimal coverage for compact objects while potentially undersampling extended sources. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that NIRSpec recovers at least $63\%$ of NIRISS-measured flux when the slit covers $&gt;15\%$ of the source or when $R_e&lt;1$kpc. For lower coverage or larger effective radii, the recovered flux varies from $24\%$ to $63\%$. When studying the \Ha/\Oiiib emission line ratio, we observe that measurements from these different spectrographs can vary by up to $\sim$0.3 dex, with significant implications for metallicity and star formation rate characterizations for individual galaxies. These results highlight the importance of considering instrumental effects when combining multi-instrument spectroscopic data and demonstrate that source morphology critically influences flux recovery between slit-based and slitless spectroscopic modes in JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Radiative Transfer for Planetary Atmospheres by Orders of Magnitude with a Transformer-Based Machine Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations. We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.</description>

      <title>Conditional variational autoencoders for cosmological model discrimination and anomaly detection in cosmic microwave background power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background power spectra are a primary window into the early universe. However, achieving interpretable, likelihood-compatible compression and fast inference under weak model assumptions remains challenging. We propose a parameter-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) that aligns a data-driven latent representation with cosmological parameters while remaining compatible with standard likelihood analyses. The model achieves high-fidelity compression of the $D_\ell^{TT}$, $D_\ell^{EE}$, and $D_\ell^{TE}$ spectra into just 5 latent dimensions, with reconstruction accuracy exceeding $99.9\%$ within Planck uncertainties. It reliably reconstructs spectra for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios, even under parameter extrapolation, and enables rapid inference, reducing the computation time from $\sim$40 hours to $\sim$2 minutes while maintaining posterior consistency. The learned latent space demonstrates a physically meaningful structure, capturing a distributed representation that mirrors known cosmological parameters and their degeneracies. Moreover, it supports highly effective unsupervised discrimination among cosmological models, achieving performance competitive with supervised approaches. Overall, this physics-informed CVAE enables anomaly detection beyond $\Lambda$CDM and points to physically meaningful directions for refinement.</description>

      <title>A Next-Generation Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrieval Framework NEXOTRANS for Emission Spectroscopy: New Constraints and Atmospheric Characterization of WASP-69b Using JWST NIRCam and MIRI Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal emission spectra provide key insights into the atmospheric composition and especially the temperature structure of an exoplanet. With broader wavelength coverage, sensitivity and higher resolution, JWST has enabled robust constraints on these properties, including detections of photochemical products. This advances the need for retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces for accurate data interpretation. In this work, we introduce the emission retrieval module of NEXOTRANS, which employs both one- and two-stream radiative transfer approximations and leverages Bayesian and machine learning techniques for retrievals. It also incorporates approximate disequilibrium chemistry models to infer photochemical species like SO2. We applied NEXOTRANS to the JWST NIRCam and MIRI emission observations of WASP-69b, covering the 2-12 microns range. The retrievals place robust constraints on the volume mixing ratios (VMR) of H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, and potential SO2. The best-fit model, i.e, free chemistry combined with non-uniform aerosol coverage, yields a log(VMR) = -3.78 (+0.15/-0.17) for H2O and -5.77 (+0.09/-0.10) for CO2 which has a sharp absorption at 4.3 micron. The second best-fit model, the hybrid equilibrium chemistry (utilizing equilibrium chemistry-grids) combined with non-uniform aerosol yields a C/O of 0.42 (+0.17/-0.13) and a metallicity of log[M/H] = 1.24 (+0.17/-0.14), corresponding to approximately 17.38 times the solar value. This hybrid chemistry retrieval also constrain SO2 with a log(VMR) = -4.85 (+0.28/-0.29), indicating possible absorption features in the 7-8 microns range. These results highlight NEXOTRANS's capability to significantly advance JWST emission spectra interpretation, offering broader insights into exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Stacking transmission spectra of different exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many areas of astronomy, spectra of different objects are co-added or stacked to improve signal-to-noise and reveal population-level characteristics. As the number of exoplanets with measured transmission spectra grows, it becomes important to understand when stacking spectra from different exoplanets is appropriate and what stacked spectra represent physically. Stacking will be particularly valuable for long-period planets, where repeated observations of the same planet are time-consuming. Here, we show that stacked exoplanet transmission spectra are approximately mathematically equivalent to spectra generated from the geometric mean of each planet's abundance ratios. We test this by comparing stacked and geometric mean spectra across grids of forward models over JWST's NIRSpec/G395H wavelength range (2.8-5.2$\mu$m). For two dominant species (e.g., H$_2$O and CO$_2$), the geometric mean accurately reflects the stacked spectrum if abundance ratios are self-similar across planets. Introducing a third species (e.g., CH$_4$) makes temperature a critical factor, with stacking becoming inappropriate across the CO/CH$_4$ boundary. Surface gravity exerts only a minor influence when stacking within comparable planetary regimes. We further assess the number of stacked, distinct sub-Neptunes with high-metallicity atmospheres and low-pressure cloud decks required to rule out a flat spectrum at $&gt;5\sigma$, as a function of both cloud deck pressure and per-planet spectral precision. These results provide guidance on when stacking is useful and on how to interpret stacked exoplanet spectra in the era of population studies of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Multi-band infrared imaging reveals dusty spiral arcs around the binary B[e] star 3 Puppis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3 Puppis is the brightest known B[e] star. Recent work classifies this A-type object as a supergiant, yet the impact of its binarity on the circumstellar environment (CE) remains hard to characterize. To resolve its dusty region at 5-10 mas, we obtained mid-IR interferometric observations with VLTI/MATISSE over 3-12 {\mu}m. Because the (u,v) coverage supports imaging, we introduce a statistical interferometric-imaging workflow based on MiRA to generate averaged images: this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered features. We also use SPARCO, an independent tool well suited to bright central objects embedded in fainter extended emission. Images from both tools in the L, M, and N bands agree and reveal an asymmetric, elongated feature ~17 mas (~10 au at 631 pc) southeast of the star with ~20% density contrast. A second northwest asymmetry and a skewed inner rim are detected. Simple geometric modelling, guided by the MATISSE images, constrains the morphology, location, and flux of the CE and its asymmetries. The images are consistent with earlier VLTI measurements but expose a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the southeast and northwest parts of the disc. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates that tidal spiral-wake perturbations from the central binary, dynamically excited at Lindblad resonances in the circumbinary disc, best explain the radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures seen in all bands.</description>

      <title>Diurnal Variations of Lee Wave Clouds on Mars using Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the diurnal behavior of lee wave clouds on Mars provides critical insight into the planet's mesoscale atmospheric dynamics and their interaction with surface topography. Lee wave clouds exhibit distinct spatial and temporal patterns that vary over the Martian day. In this study, we investigate the diurnal distribution and frequency of lee wave cloud activity during Martian Year (MY) 36 using observations from the EXI instrument aboard the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) "Hope" spacecraft. A total of 50 lee wave events were identified, with a pronounced peak in activity during afternoon hours between solar longitudes (Ls) 270 deg and 360 deg. Our analysis reveals a seasonal and local-time dependence for these clouds, providing a comparative framework with previous mission datasets. These findings not only enhance the current understanding of Martian weather processes but also support future efforts to model and predict terrain-induced cloud dynamics across key locations on Mars.</description>

      <title>Pointing Accuracy Improvements for the South Pole Telescope with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present improvements to the pointing accuracy of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) using machine learning. The ability of the SPT to point accurately at the sky is limited by its structural imperfections, which are impacted by the extreme weather at the South Pole. Pointing accuracy is particularly important during SPT participation in observing campaigns with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which requires stricter accuracy than typical observations with the SPT. We compile a training dataset of historical observations of astronomical sources made with the SPT-3G and EHT receivers on the SPT. We train two XGBoost models to learn a mapping from current weather conditions to two telescope drive control arguments -- one which corrects for errors in azimuth and the other for errors in elevation. Our trained models achieve root mean squared errors on withheld test data of $2.14''$ in cross-elevation and $3.57''$ in elevation, well below our goal of $5''$ along each axis. We deploy our models on the telescope control system and perform further in situ test observations during the EHT observing campaign in 2024 April. Our models result in significantly improved pointing accuracy: for sources within the range of input variables where the models are best trained, average combined pointing error improved 33%, from $15.9''$ to $10.6''$. These improvements, while significant, fall shy of our ultimate goal, but they serve as a proof of concept for the development of future models. Planned upgrades to the EHT receiver on the SPT will necessitate even stricter pointing accuracy which will be achievable with our methods.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</description>

      <title>AstroVisBench: A Code Benchmark for Scientific Computing and Visualization in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20538v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature, answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However, evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows, which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.</description>
