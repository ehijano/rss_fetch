      <title>Inference in a Stationary/Nonstationary Autoregressive Time-Varying-Parameter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers nonparametric estimation and inference in first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) models with deterministically time-varying parameters. A key feature of the proposed approach is to allow for time-varying stationarity in some time periods, time-varying nonstationarity (i.e., unit root or local-to-unit root behavior) in other periods, and smooth transitions between the two. The estimation of the AR parameter at any time point is based on a local least squares regression method, where the relevant initial condition is endogenous. We obtain limit distributions for the AR parameter estimator and t-statistic at a given point $\tau$ in time when the parameter exhibits unit root, local-to-unity, or stationary/stationary-like behavior at time $\tau$. These results are used to construct confidence intervals and median-unbiased interval estimators for the AR parameter at any specified point in time. The confidence intervals have correct asymptotic coverage probabilities with the coverage holding uniformly over stationary and nonstationary behavior of the observations.</description>

      <title>Calibrated quantile prediction for Growth-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate computation of robust estimates for extremal quantiles of empirical distributions is an essential task for a wide range of applicative fields, including economic policymaking and the financial industry. Such estimates are particularly critical in calculating risk measures, such as Growth-at-Risk (GaR). % and Value-at-Risk (VaR). This work proposes a conformal framework to estimate calibrated quantiles, and presents an extensive simulation study and a real-world analysis of GaR to examine its benefits with respect to the state of the art. Our findings show that CP methods consistently improve the calibration and robustness of quantile estimates at all levels. The calibration gains are appreciated especially at extremal quantiles, which are critical for risk assessment and where traditional methods tend to fall short. In addition, we introduce a novel property that guarantees coverage under the exchangeability assumption, providing a valuable tool for managing risks by quantifying and controlling the likelihood of future extreme observations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Regularizers for Reverse Unrestricted Mixed Data Sampling Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reverse Unrestricted MIxed DAta Sampling (RU-MIDAS) regressions are used to model high-frequency responses by means of low-frequency variables. However, due to the periodic structure of RU-MIDAS regressions, the dimensionality grows quickly if the frequency mismatch between the high- and low-frequency variables is large. Additionally the number of high-frequency observations available for estimation decreases. We propose to counteract this reduction in sample size by pooling the high-frequency coefficients and further reduce the dimensionality through a sparsity-inducing convex regularizer that accounts for the temporal ordering among the different lags. To this end, the regularizer prioritizes the inclusion of lagged coefficients according to the recency of the information they contain. We demonstrate the proposed method on two empirical applications, one on realized volatility forecasting with macroeconomic data and another on demand forecasting for a bicycle-sharing system with ridership data on other transportation types.</description>

      <title>A Short Note on Event-Study Synthetic Difference-in-Differences Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose an event study extension of Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) estimators. I show that, in simple and staggered adoption designs, estimators from Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) can be disaggregated into dynamic treatment effect estimators, comparing the lagged outcome differentials of treated and synthetic controls to their pre-treatment average. Estimators presented in this note can be computed using the sdid_event Stata package.</description>

      <title>Inference on High Dimensional Selective Labeling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of simultaneous equation models arise in the many domains where observed binary outcomes are themselves a consequence of the existing choices of of one of the agents in the model. These models are gaining increasing interest in the computer science and machine learning literatures where they refer the potentially endogenous sample selection as the {\em selective labels} problem. Empirical settings for such models arise in fields as diverse as criminal justice, health care, and insurance. For important recent work in this area, see for example Lakkaruju et al. (2017), Kleinberg et al. (2018), and Coston et al.(2021) where the authors focus on judicial bail decisions, and where one observes the outcome of whether a defendant filed to return for their court appearance only if the judge in the case decides to release the defendant on bail. Identifying and estimating such models can be computationally challenging for two reasons. One is the nonconcavity of the bivariate likelihood function, and the other is the large number of covariates in each equation. Despite these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel distribution free estimation procedure that is computationally friendly in many covariates settings. The new method combines the semiparametric batched gradient descent algorithm introduced in Khan et al.(2023) with a novel sorting algorithms incorporated to control for selection bias. Asymptotic properties of the new procedure are established under increasing dimension conditions in both equations, and its finite sample properties are explored through a simulation study and an application using judicial bail data.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Potential of Robustness in Selecting Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for personalized decision-making has led to a surge of interest in estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). Various types of CATE estimators have been developed with advancements in machine learning and causal inference. However, selecting the desirable CATE estimator through a conventional model validation procedure remains impractical due to the absence of counterfactual outcomes in observational data. Existing approaches for CATE estimator selection, such as plug-in and pseudo-outcome metrics, face two challenges. First, they must determine the metric form and the underlying machine learning models for fitting nuisance parameters (e.g., outcome function, propensity function, and plug-in learner). Second, they lack a specific focus on selecting a robust CATE estimator. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Distributionally Robust Metric (DRM) for CATE estimator selection. The proposed DRM is nuisance-free, eliminating the need to fit models for nuisance parameters, and it effectively prioritizes the selection of a distributionally robust CATE estimator. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the DRM method in selecting CATE estimators that are robust to the distribution shift incurred by covariate shift and hidden confounders.</description>
