      <title>On Irreversibility and Stochastic Systems: Part One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We attempt to characterize irreversibility of a dynamical system from the existence of different forward and backward mathematical representations depending on the direction of the time arrow. Such different representations have been studied intensively and are shown to exist for stochastic diffusion models. In this setting one has however to face the preliminary justification of stochastic description for physical systems which are described by classical mechanics as inherently deterministic and conservative.
  In part one of this paper we first address this modeling problem for linear systems in a deterministic context. We show that forward-backward representations can also describe conservative finite dimensional deterministic systems when they are coupled to an infinite-dimensional conservative heat bath. A novel key observation is that the heat bath acts on the finite-dimensional conservative system by {\em state-feedback} and can shift its eigenvalues to make the system dissipative but may also generate another totally unstable model which naturally evolves backward in time.
  In the second part, we address the stochastic description of these two representations. Under a natural family of invariant measures the heat bath can be shown to induce a white noise input acting on the system making it look like a true dissipative diffusion.</description>

      <title>Effective potential of a spinning heavy symmetric top when magnitudes of conserved angular momenta are not equal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.06168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are various types of motion of a heavy symmetric top like regular precession, cusp like motion, rise of the top, etc. One of the tools used to understand that motion is effective potential. The effective potential for a spinning heavy symmetric top is studied when magnitudes of conserved angular momenta are not equal to each other. The dependence of effective potential on conserved angular momenta is analyzed. This study shows that the minimum of effective potential goes to a constant derived from conserved angular momenta when one of the conserved angular momenta is greater than the other one, and it goes to infinity when the other one is greater. It also shows that the usage of strong or weak top separation does not work adequately in all cases.</description>

      <title>Anti-localization of non-stationary quasi-waves in a strongly nonlinear $\beta$-FPUT chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new general wave phenomenon, namely "the anti-localization of non-stationary linear waves", has been introduced and discussed (Shishkina et al., J. Sound. Vib. 553, 2023, 117673). This is zeroing of the propagating component for a non-stationary wave-field near a defect in infinitely long wave-guides. The phenomenon is known to be observed in both continuum and discrete mechanical systems with a defect, provided that the frequency spectrum for the corresponding homogeneous system possesses a stop-band. In this paper, we show that the anti-localization is also quite common for nonlinear systems. To demonstrate this, we numerically solve several non-stationary problems for an infinite strongly nonlinear $\beta$-FPUT chain with a defect. In our opinion, the anti-localization essentially influences the processes of heat transfer in linear and nonlinear lattices.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral outside a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for the fast evaluation of the transient acoustic field generated outside a spherical surface using surface data on the sphere. The method employs Lebedev quadratures, which are optimal integration on the sphere, and Lagrange interpolation and differentiation in an advanced time algorithm for the evaluation of the transient field. Numerical testing demonstrates that the approach gives near machine-precision accuracy and a speed-up in evaluation time which depends on the order of quadrature rule employed but breaks even with direct evaluation at a number of field points about 1.15 times the number of surface quadrature nodes, making the method an efficient means of evaluating the field generated by a large number of sources.</description>

      <title>Rubber Friction: Theory, Mechanisms, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rubber friction is of major practical importance in applications such as tires, rubber seals, and footwear. This review article focuses on the theory and experimental studies of rubber friction on substrates with random roughness. We examine both steady sliding and accelerated motion, with particular attention to the origins of the breakloose friction force and the influence of pre-slip, elasticity, and flash temperature on friction dynamics. We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cut-off, are discussed.</description>
