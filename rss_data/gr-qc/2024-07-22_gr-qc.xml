      <title>Morris-Thorne-type Wormhole with Global Monopole Charge and the Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate topologically charged Morris-Thorne-type wormholes using various shape function forms. We solve the Einstein field equations incorporating an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor and obtain different physical quantities associated with the matter content. A crucial aspect of this study is the non-exotic matter distribution, examined through the evaluation of energy conditions, and exploring how different shape functions impact these conditions. Additionally, the anisotropy parameter is calculated to quantify the extent of attractive or repulsive behavior. Our study demonstrates that for different types of shape function forms, the energy conditions are influenced by the global monopole parameter. Our findings provide valuable insights for further theoretical explorations of these fascinating hypothetical structures in the realm of general relativity and beyond</description>

      <title>Testing the Kerr nature with binary black hole inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of general relativity (GR) is the standard framework for the description of gravitation and the geometric structure of spacetime. With the recent advancement of observational instruments, it has become possible to probe the strong field regime to test GR. We present the constraints obtained from the binary black hole inspiral data of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) observations on the deformations of some popular parametrized non-Kerr metrics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of phantom cold dark matter from spacetime diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A way to reconcile general relativity and quantum field theory without quantising the geometry is to demand the metric evolve stochastically. In this article, we explore the consequences of such a proposal at early cosmological times. We find the stochastic evolution results in the spatial metric diffusing away from its deterministic value, generating phantom cold dark matter (CDM). It is produced primarily at the end of the inflationary phase of the Universe's evolution, with a statistical distribution that depends on the specifics of the early-times cosmological model. We find the energy density of this phantom cold dark matter is positive on average, a necessary condition to reproduce the cosmological phenomenology of CDM, although further work is required to calculate its mean density and spatial distribution. If the density is cosmologically significant, phantom dark matter acts on the geometry in a way that is indistinguishable from conventional CDM. As such, it has the potential to reproduce phenomenology such as structure formation, lensing, and galactic rotation curves. We conclude by discussing the possibility of testing hybrid theories of gravity by combining measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background with tabletop experiments.</description>

      <title>Can light-rings self-gravitate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a spherically symmetric and static spacetime of a compact object, such as that of a Schwarzschild black hole, the light-ring is a 2-sphere where photons experience the only possible circular orbits. As a "Gedankenexperiment", we imagine an advanced civilisation able to populate the light-ring of a nonrotating black hole of mass $M$ with photons having a fine-tuned impact parameter that allows their orbits to be exactly circular with radius $r=3M$. As the number of photons in the light-ring increases in time, its mass will no longer be negligible and hence it will impact on the background spacetime, that is, it will "self-gravitate". We here consider two different routes to assign a nonzero mass to the light-ring that are either based on a discrete concentration of photons on a specific radial location or on a suitable distribution of photons in a given region. In both cases, and using the Einstein equations, we find that the inclusion of the energy from the accumulated photons leads to the generation of new light-rings. Such new light-rings can either appear at well-defined but discrete locations, or be fused in a well-defined region. In either case, we show that such light-ring configurations are dynamically unstable and a small perturbation, either via the inclusion of an additional photon onto the light-ring or via the absorption of a photon by the black hole, leads to a catastrophic destruction of the light-ring structures.</description>

      <title>Nonmetricity and Poincare gauge gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in a spacetime geometry with general connection, there exist field redefinitions that replace the mixed-symmetry nonmetricity of the asymmetric connection with the sum of torsion and the field strength of special conformal transformations of a Lorentzian connection. In contrast to general relativity, generic action functionals give different results for metric versus Palatini-style variations. We consider some of the resulting issues in Poincar\`e gauge theory, where it is natural to vary both the solder form and the spin connection, and where the action may differ from the Einstein-Hilbert case. Independent variation may introduce nonmetricity as well as torsion. Appending the defining equation of nonmetricity to the Maurer-Cartan equations of the Poincar\`e Lie algebra, we show that the mixed symmetry components of nonmetricity can be absorbed into an altered torsion tensor, restoring local Lorentz symmetry and metric compatibility while including quadratic terms in the redefined curvature. In order to recover the original torsion and nonmetric fields, we replace the definition of nonmetricity by an additional structure equation. We show that the maximal Lie algebra compatible with the enlarged set is isomorphic to the conformal Lie algebra. Therefore, in a Lorentzian conformal geometry the sum of torsion and the field strength of special conformal transformations is given by the mixed symmetry nonmetricity of an equivalent asymmetric system.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the discovery of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a novel proof on this relation using a completely new geometric approach, in which the stable and unstable photon spheres are determined by Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrated the existence of photon spheres near black holes with proper asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we proved that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis in this study is limited to the spherically symmetric black hole spacetime (with the spacetime metric $ds^{2}=g_{tt}dt^{2}+g_{rr}dr^{2}+g_{\theta\theta}d\theta^{2}+g_{\phi\phi}d\phi^{2}$).</description>

      <title>Revisiting Flat Rotation Curves in Chern-Simons Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit slow rotating black hole (BH) solutions in Chern-Simons modified gravity (CSMG) by considering perturbative solution about Schwarzschild BH. In particular, the case when nondynamical CSMG with noncanonical CS scalar is considered. We provide a new solution different from the previously obtained one \cite{Konno:2007ze} which we refer to as KMT model. The present solution accounts for frame dragging effect which includes not only radial dependence as in the KMT. Nevertheless, it reduces to KMT as a particular case. We show that the tidal gravitational force (Kretschmann invariant) associated to the present solution contains a term of order $1/r^3$ additional to Schwarzschild but absent from directional divergence, unlike KMT model which diverges along the axis of symmetry. We derive the corresponding circular velocity of a massive test particle in which the KMT velocity is recovered in addition to an extra term $\propto r$. We investigate possible constraints on KMT and the present solutions from the observed rotation curve of UGC11455 galaxy as an example. We show that perturbation solutions cannot physically explain the flattening of galactic rotation curves.</description>

Abstract: We study cosmological models based on the interior of the revisited Schwarzschild black hole recently reported in [Phys.~Rev.~D{\bf 109} (2024) 104032]. We find that these solutions describe a non-trivial Kantowski-Sachs universe, for which we provide an explicit analytical example with all the details and describe some general features of the singularity.</description>

      <title>From the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularities to Einstein-Maxwell phantom wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14184v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Janis-Newman-Winicour spacetime corresponds to a static spherically symmetric solution of Einstein equations with the energy momentum tensor of a massless quintessence field. It is understood that the spacetime describes a naked singularity. The solution has two parameters, $b$ and $s$. To our knowledge, the exact physical meaning of the two parameters is still unclear. In this paper, starting from the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution, we first obtain a wormhole solution by a complex transformation. Then let the parameter $s$ approaching infinity, we obtain the well-known exponential wormhole solution. After that, we embed both the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity and its wormhole counterpart in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe with the energy momentum tensor of massive quintessence and massive phantom fields, respectively. To our surprise, the resulting quintessence potential is actually the dilaton potential found by one of us. It hints us that, by modulating the parameters in the charged dilaton black hole solutions we can get the Janis-Newman-Winicour solution. Furthermore, a charged wormhole solution is obtained by performing complex transformation on the charged dilaton black hole solutions in the background of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter Universe. We eventually find that $s$ is actually related to the coupling constant of dilaton field to Maxwell field and $b$ is related to a negative mass for the dilaton black holes. A negative black hole mass is physically forbidden. Therefore, we conclude that the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity solution is not physically allowed.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Perturbed Black Holes: Background Hidden Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the presence of integrable hidden structures in the dynamics of perturbed non-rotating black holes (BHs). This can also be considered as a first step in a wider program of an effective identification of ``slow'' and ``fast'' degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the (binary) BH dynamics, following a wave-mean flow perspective. The slow DoFs would be associated with a nonlinear integrable dynamics, on which the fast ones propagate following an effective linear dynamics. BH perturbation theory offers a natural ground to test these properties. Indeed, the decoupling of Einstein equations into wave master equations with a potential provides an instance of such splitting into (frozen) slow DoFs (background potential) over which the linear dynamics of the fast ones (perturbation master functions) evolve. It has been recently shown that these wave equations possess an infinite number of symmetries that correspond to the flow of the infinite hierarchy of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations. Starting from these results, we systematically investigate the presence of integrable structures in BH perturbation theory. We first study them in Cauchy slices and then extend the analysis to hyperboloidal foliations. This second step introduces a splitting of the master equation into bulk and boundary contributions, unveiling an underlying structural relation with the slow and fast DoFs. This insight represents a first step to establish the integrable structures associated to the slow DoFs as bulk symmetries of the dynamics of perturbed BHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the numerical stability of the covariant Baumgarte--Shapiro--Shibata--Nakamura (cBSSN) formulation against the Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker spacetime. To evaluate the numerical stability, we calculate the constraint amplification factor by the eigenvalue analysis of the evolution of the constraint. We propose a modification to the time evolution equations of the cBSSN formulation for a higher numerical stability. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations using the modified formulation to confirm its improved stability.</description>

      <title>New simple and accurate approximations for quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new simple approximations for quintessence in a spatially homogeneous, isotropic and flat spacetime. The approximations are typically an order of magnitude more accurate than anything available in the literature, which from an observational perspective makes numerical calculations superfluous. For example, our tracking quintessence approximation, with one less parameter than CPL and a comparably simple expression, yields a $0.1\%$ maximum relative error of $H(z)/H_0$ for the inverse power law scalar field potential. We situate the new results in a broader dark energy context, where the present parametrized deviations from $\Lambda$CDM offer simple alternatives to the CPL parametrization, useful for observations at increasingly large redshifts.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Starobinsky Inflation and the Species Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potentials in cosmological inflation often involve scalars with trans-Planckian ranges. As a result, towers of states become massless and their presence pushes the fundamental scale not to coincide with $M_{\rm P}$ but rather with the $species\, scale$, $\Lambda$. This scale transforms as an automorphic form of the theory's duality symmetries. We propose that the inflaton potential should be 1) an automorphic invariant form, non-singular over all moduli space, 2) depending only on $\Lambda$ and its field derivatives, and 3) approaching constant values in the large moduli to ensure a long period of inflation. These conditions lead to the proposal $V \sim \lambda(\phi, \phi^*)$, with $\lambda = G^{i\bar{j}} (\partial_i \Lambda)(\partial_{\bar{j}} \Lambda) / \Lambda^2$, determining the 'species scale convex hull'. For a single elliptic complex modulus with $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry, this results in an inflaton potential $V \simeq (\text{Im} \tau)^2 |\tilde{G}_2|^2 / N^2$, with $N \simeq -\log(\text{Im} \tau |\eta(\tau)|^4)$, where $\eta$ is the Dedekind function and $\tilde{G}_2$ the Eisenstein modular form of weight 2. Surprisingly, this potential at large modulus resembles that of the Starobinsky model. We compute inflation parameters yielding results similar to Starobinsky's, but extended to modular invariant expressions. Interestingly, the number of e-folds is proportional to the number of species in the tower, $N_e \simeq N$, and $\epsilon \simeq \Lambda^4$ at large moduli, suggesting that the tower of states plays an important role in the inflation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work I have shown that Herglotz actions reproduce the dynamics of classical mechanical theories which exhibit dynamical similarities. Recent work has shown how to extend field theories in both the Lagrangian and de Donder-Weyl formalism to contact geometry. In this article I show how dynamical similarity applies in field theory. This is applied in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, producing the contact equivalents. The result can be applied to general relativity where I demonstrate how to construct a complete description of the dynamics, equivalent to those derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action, without reference to the conformal factor.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure of scalar-Maxwell theory at the null boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the Hamiltonian formalism to investigate the massless sector of scalar field theory coupled with Maxwell electrodynamics through the Pontryagin term. Specifically, we analyze asymptotic symmetries at the null infinity of this theory, conserved charges, and their algebra. We find that the theory possesses asymptotic shift symmetries of the fields not present in the bulk manifold coming from the zero modes of the symplectic matrix of constraints. Consequently, we conclude that the real scalar field also contains asymptotic symmetries previously found in the literature by a different approach. We show that these symmetries are the origin of the electric-magnetic duality in electromagnetism with the topological Pontryagin term, and obtain non-trivial central extension between the electric and magnetic conserved charges. Finally, we examine the full interacting theory and find that, due to the interaction, the symmetry generators are more difficult to identify among the constraints, such that we obtain them in the weak-coupling limit. We find that the asymptotic structure of the theory simplifies due to a fast fall-off of the scalar field, leading to decoupled scalar and Maxwell asymptotic sectors, and losing the electric-magnetic duality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic superconductors are holographic duals of superconductors. Macroscopically, a superconductor should be described by the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are described by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory is little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are obtained analytically.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-driven likelihood-free parameter inference for 21-cm forest observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperfine structure absorption lines of neutral hydrogen in spectra of high-redshift radio sources, known collectively as the 21-cm forest, have been demonstrated as a sensitive probe to the small-scale structures governed by the dark matter (DM) properties, as well as the thermal history of the intergalactic medium regulated by the first galaxies during the epoch of reionization. By statistically analyzing these spectral features, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can effectively break the parameter degeneracies and constrain the properties of both DM and the first galaxies. However, conventional parameter inference methods face challenges due to computationally expensive simulations for 21-cm forest and the non-Gaussian signal characteristics. To address these issues, we introduce generative normalizing flows for data augmentation and inference normalizing flows for parameters estimation. This approach efficiently estimates parameters from minimally simulated datasets with non-Gaussian signals. Using simulated data from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA), we demonstrate the ability of the deep learning-driven likelihood-free approach to generate accurate posterior distributions, providing a robust and efficient tool for probing DM and the cosmic heating history using the 1D power spectrum of 21-cm forest in the era of SKA. This methodology is adaptable for scientific analyses with other unevenly distributed data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction to two dimensions of certain gravitational theories in $D \geq 4$ dimensions at the two-derivative level. It is known that the resulting field equations describe an integrable system in two dimensions which can also be obtained by a dimensional reduction of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four dimensions. We use this relation to construct a single copy prescription for classes of gravitational solutions in Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou coordinates. In contrast with previous proposals, we find that the gauge group of the Yang-Mills single copy carries non-trivial information about the gravitational solution. We illustrate our single copy prescription with various examples that include the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom solution, the Kaluza-Klein rotating attractor solution, the Einstein-Rosen wave solution and the self-dual Kleinian Taub-NUT solution.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array sensitivity to anisotropies in the gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations have recently gathered substantial evidence for the existence of a gravitational wave background in the nHz frequency band. Searching for anisotropies in this signal is key to determining its origin, and in particular to distinguish possible astrophysical from cosmological sources. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of current and future pulsar timing arrays to such anisotropies using the full covariance matrix of pulsar timing delays. While current day pulsar timing arrays can only set mildly informative constraints on the dipole and quadrupole, we show that percent level accuracy for several low multipoles can be achieved in the near future. Moreover, we demonstrate that anisotropies in the gravitational wave background and the Hellings-Downs angular correlation, indicating the presence of GWs, are approximately uncorrelated, and can hence be reconstructed independently. These results can be reproduced with \href{https://github.com/Mauropieroni/fastPTA}{\texttt{fastPTA}}, a publicly available Python code to forecast the constraining power of PTA configurations.</description>

Abstract: We establish a gluing theorem for linearised vacuum gravitational fields in Bondi gauge on a class of characteristic surfaces in static vacuum four-dimensional backgrounds with cosmological constant $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ and arbitrary topology of the compact cross-sections of the null hypersurface. This generalises and complements, in the linearised case, the pioneering analysis of Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, carried-out on light-cones in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a cosmological model in $ f(R, G) $ gravity in a flat space-time, where $ R $ is the Ricci scalar and $ G $ is the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The function $ f(R, G) $ is taken as a linear combination of $ R $ and an exponential function of $ G $. We analyze the observational constraints under a power law cosmology which depends on two physical parameters: the Hubble constant $ H_0 $ and the deceleration parameter $ q $. We constrain these two dependent parameters using the latest 77 points of the OHD data, 1048 points of the Pantheon data, and the joint data OHD+Pantheon and compare the results with the $ \Lambda $CDM. Also, we speculate constraints using a simulated data set for the future JDEM (Joint Dark Energy Mission)/Omega, supernovae survey. We see that $ H_0 $ is in very close agreement with some of the latest results from the Planck Collaboration that assume the $ \Lambda $CDM model. Our work in power law cosmology better fits the Pantheon data than the earlier analysis \cite{Kumar:2011sw, Rani:2014sia}. However, the constraints obtained on $ H $ average, $ &lt;H_0&gt; $ and $ q $ average, $ &lt;q&gt; $ using the simulated data set for the future JDEM/Omega, supernovae survey are found to be inconsistent with the values obtained from the OHD and the Pantheon data. Additionally, we discuss statefinder diagnostics and see that the power law models approach the standard $\Lambda $CDM model ($ q\rightarrow -1 $). This model satisfies the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics. Finally, we conclude that the power law cosmology in $ f(R, G) $ gravity explains most of the distinguished attributes of evolution in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Spectroscopy for Precessing Binary Black Hole Coalescences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectroscopic study of black hole quasinormal modes in gravitational-wave ringdown observations is hindered by our ignorance of which modes should dominate astrophysical signals for different binary configurations, limiting tests of general relativity and astrophysics. In this work, we present a description of the quasinormal modes that are excited in the ringdowns of comparable mass, quasi-circular precessing binary black hole coalescences -- a key region of parameter space that has yet to be fully explored within the framework of black hole spectroscopy. We suggest that the remnant perturbation for precessing and non-precessing systems is approximately the same up to a rotation, which implies that the relative amplitudes of the quasinormal modes in both systems are also related by a rotation. We present evidence for this by analyzing an extensive catalog of numerical relativity simulations. Additional structure in the amplitudes is connected to the system's kick velocity and other asymmetries in the orbital dynamics. We find that the ringdowns of precessing systems need not be dominated by the ${(\ell,m)=(2,\pm 2)}$ quasinormal modes, and that instead the $(2,\pm 1)$~or~$(2,0)$ quasinormal modes can dominate. Our results are consistent with a ringdown analysis of the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave signal GW190521, and may also help in understanding phenomenological inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model systematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show analytically that there exist compact stellar objects akin to neutron stars whose radius is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius defined by Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass. The radius of the compact object is defined by the radius where the energy density and the pressure of ordinary matter vanish, while clouds of scalar(s) can extend beyond this radius -- a situation that is often encountered in modified gravity theories, like $F(R)$ gravity and the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The clouds of scalar mode(s) give additional contributions to the ADM mass and as a result, the corresponding Schwarzschild radius given by the ADM mass can be larger than that of the compact object.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we delve into the model of the shift symmetric and parity-preserving Beyond Horndeski theory in all its generality. We present an explicit algorithm to extract static and spherically symmetric black holes with primary scalar charge adhering to the conservation of the Noether current emanating from the shift symmetry. We show that when the functionals $G_2$ and $G_4$ of the theory are linearly dependent, analytic homogeneous black-hole solutions exist, which can become regular by virtue of the primary charge contribution. Such geometries can easily enjoy the preservation of the Weak Energy Conditions, elevating them into healthier compact objects than most hairy black holes in modified theories of gravity. Finally, we revisit the concept of disformal transformations as a solution-generating mechanism and discuss the case of generic $G_2$ and $G_4$ functionals.</description>

Abstract: As shown in the classic work of Belinski, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz, the approach to a generic space-like singularity in general relativity consists of a sequence of eras and epochs in which the metric is locally Kasner, connected by brief transitions. When quantum gravity effects are included, we argue that a new type of transition arises, giving rise to Kasner eons: periods which are dominated by emergent physics at each energy scale. We comment on the different ways in which the Einsteinian eon may come to an end and show explicitly how additional Kasner eons arise in the interior of a black hole solution due to higher-derivative corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop generalized no-scale supergravity models of inflation, and then study the corresponding cosmological predictions as well as the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). With a new parameter $0&lt;a\leq 1$, the generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $a\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of PBHs with various mass scales, which could account for a significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</description>

Abstract: We study the homogeneous and anisotropic evolution of Bianchi type-I spacetime driven by perfect fluid with shear viscosity. We obtain exact solutions by considering the simplest form of the equation of state wherein the pressure and the shear stress are proportional to the energy density individually. A special case of our general solutions represent Bianchi type-VII cosmology. We analyse the singularity structure of the solutions and its connection with various energy conditions. We find that the initial singularity can be removed only for the Bianchi type-VII. We also analyse the late-time behaviour of the solutions and find that, compared to the usual Friedmann universe, the spacetime expands less rapidly and the energy density drops faster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the method of calculating the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation of black holes using the "in" vacuum state, which describes one-sided asymptotically flat neutral black hole formed by gravitational collapse, to dynamic charged black holes. We explore the influence of charge on the position of the boundary of island $\partial I$ and the Page time. Due to their distinct geometric structures, we discuss non-extremal and extremal charged black holes separately. In non-extremal cases, the emergence of island saves the bound of entropy at late times, and the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation satisfies the Page curve. Moreover, we also find that the position of the boundary of island $\partial I$ depends on the position of the cutoff surface (observers), differing from the behavior in eternal charged black holes. In extremal black holes, when the island exists, the entanglement entropy is approximately equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, while the entanglement entropy becomes ill-defined when island is absent. Our analysis underscores how different geometric configurations significantly influence the behavior of entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Comisso-Asenjo mechanism is a novel mechanism proposed recently to extract energy from black holes through magnetic reconnection of the surrounding charged plasma, in which the magnetic field plays a crucial role. In this work, we revisit this process by taking into account the backreaction of the magnetic field on the black hole's geometry. We employ the Kerr-Melvin metric to describe the local near-horizon geometry of the magnetized black hole. By analyzing the circular orbits in the equatorial plane, energy extraction conditions, power and efficiency of the energy extraction, we found that while a stronger magnetic field can enhance plasma magnetization and aid energy extraction, its backreaction on the spacetime may hinder the process, with a larger magnetic field posing a greater obstacle. Balancing these effects, an optimal moderate magnetic field strength is found to be most conducive to energy extraction. Moreover, there is a maximum limit to the magnetic field strength associated with the black hole's spin, beyond which circular orbits in the equatorial plane are prohibited, thereby impeding energy extraction in the current scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of quantum field excitations or particles in cosmological spacetimes is a hallmark prediction of curved quantum field theory. The generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the early universe constitutes an important application. The problem can be quantum-simulated in terms of structure formation in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with time-dependent s-wave scattering length. Here, we explore a mapping between cosmological particle production in general (D+1)-dimensional spacetimes and scattering problems described by the non-relativistic stationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension. Through this mapping, intuitive explanations for emergent spatial structures in both the BEC and the cosmological system can be obtained for a large class of analogue cosmological scenarios, ranging from power-law expansions to periodic modulations. The investigated cosmologies and their scattering analogues are tuned to be implemented in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum field simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a new class of modified gravity models, that is, generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models, whose action is characterized by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $f(R, {}^*RR)$. Within this framework, we derive the gravitational field equations and solve them for a particular model, $f(R, {}^*RR)=R+\beta ({}^*RR)^2$, considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating metric and first-order perturbations of G\"{o}del-type metrics. For the former, we find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the parameter $L$, which characterizes the departures from general relativity results. For the latter, G\"{o}del-type metrics hold unperturbed. We conclude this paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin models admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two scalar fields: $\Phi$, a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second, $\vartheta$, a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field $\vartheta$ emerges coupled with the Chern-Pontryagin topological term ${}^*RR$, i.e., $\vartheta {}^*RR$, which is nothing more than Chern-Simons term.</description>

Abstract: The exact Friedman solution to the field equations of General Relativity (GR) describing an homogeneous and isotropic universe together with its linear and higher-order perturbations are the theoretical roots of the current standard model of cosmology. However, despite its global successes, this standard model currently faces a number of tensions and anomalies, which occur mostly from a mismatch between early and late cosmic time region depictions. Actually, in the era of precision cosmology, the late inhomogeneities in the densities of the Universe components can no more be neglected. Moreover, since GR is fundamentally nonlinear, any linear perturbation theory is doomed to fail at reproducing precisely its features, while higher-order perturbed FLRW models cannot either claim the status of exact solution to Einstein's field equations. Fortunately, other GR solutions exist which are best suited for this purpose, e. g., exact inhomogeneous solutions able to represent a matter-cosmological constant dominated universe region. Among these, the Szekeres solution, which is devoid of any symmetry, appears as a proper tool for this purpose. Moreover, since these solutions possess the FLRW model as a homogeneous limit, they can be very smoothly matched to the standard representation at the inhomogeneity-homogeneity transition. In this paper, the Szekeres solution and its main interesting properties, as well as the equations needed to use this solution in a cosmological context are presented. Then the prospects for a broader use of its abilities are sketched out. In particular, the use of neural networks is proposed to allow, in the future, the fitting of the huge amount of data becoming available to constrain the arbitrary functions and the constant parameters characterizing the Szekeres model, running for representing our late Universe with an increased precision.</description>

Abstract: The ability of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory to accurately predict the primordial abundances of helium and deuterium, as well as the baryon content of the Universe, is considered one of the most significant achievements in modern physics. In the present study, we consider two highly motivated hybrid $f(T)$ models and constrain them using the observations from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis era. In addition, using late-time observations of Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma-Ray-Bursts, the ranges of the model parameters are confined which are in good agreement with early time bounds. Subsequently, the common ranges obtained from the analysis for early and late time are summarized. Further, we verify the intermediating epochs by investigating the profiles of cosmographic parameters using the model parameter values from the common range. From this study, we find the considered teleparallel models are viable candidates to explain the primordial-intermediating-present epochs.</description>

      <title>Thermal curvature perturbations in thermal inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the power spectrum of super-horizon curvature perturbations generated during a late period of thermal inflation, taking into account fluctuation-dissipation effects resulting from the scalar flaton field's interactions with the ambient radiation bath. We find that, at the onset of thermal inflation, the flaton field may reach an equilibrium with the radiation bath even for relatively small coupling constants, maintaining a spectrum of thermal fluctuations until the critical temperature $T_c$, below which thermal effects stop holding the field at the false potential minimum. This enhances the field variance compared to purely quantum fluctuations, therefore increasing the average energy density during thermal inflation and damping the induced curvature perturbations. In particular, we find that this inhibits the later formation of primordial black holes, at least on scales that leave the horizon for $T&gt;T_c$. The larger thermal field variance also reduces the duration of a period of fast-roll inflation below $T_c$, as the field rolls to the true potential minimum, which should also affect the generation of (large) curvature perturbations on even smaller scales.</description>

      <title>On AdS black holes in two-dimensional dilaton gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present three analytic AdS black hole solutions in a two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory, which contains two scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity. Our solutions I and II contain two arbitrary integration constants in the blackening factor $f(r)$, with which we can impose an extremality condition. Solution I coincides with a previously reported AdS black hole when one of the integration constants vanishes in $f(r)$ and we have only one non-trivial scalar field. Solution III corresponds to an extreme black hole configuration with an asymptotically finite constant dilaton field. For all of our solutions, both non-extremal and extremal, the scalar curvature is constant and negative, corresponding to $AdS_2$ spacetime. Thus, we show that pure $AdS_2$ geometry arises outside the event horizon of all our black hole configurations, not only in the near horizon region. In order to elucidate their black hole nature, we explore the causal structure of solutions I and II with the aid of suitable Kruskal-like coordinates and Penrose diagrams. By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi method, we construct a boundary counter-term that renders a renormalized action with a vanishing variation. We use this finite action for the partition function in the semi-classical approximation. We establish a consistent Thermodynamics, verified by the first law, across all the black hole solutions presented, including the extreme case.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on future rip scenarios with holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic future evolution of holographic dark energy (HDE) models, in which the density of the dark energy is a function of a cutoff scale $L$. We develop a general methodology to determine which models correspond to future big rip, little rip, and pseudo-rip (de Sitter) evolution, and we apply this methodology to a variety of well-studied HDE models. None of these HDE models display little rip evolution, and we are able to show, under very general assumptions, that HDE models with a Granda-Oliveros cutoff almost never evolve toward a future little rip. We extend these results to HDE models with nonstandard Friedman equations and show that a similar conclusion applies: little rip evolution is a very special case that is almost never realized in such models.</description>

      <title>Similarities between projective quantum fields and the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many homogeneous, four-dimensional space-time geometries can be considered within real projective geometry, which yields a mathematically well-defined framework for their deformations and limits without the appearance of singularities. Focussing on generalized unitary transformation behavior, projective quantum fields can be axiomatically introduced, which transform smoothly under geometry deformations and limits. Connections on the related projective frame bundles provide gauge fields with gauge group $\mathrm{PGL}_5\mathbb{R}$. For Poincar\'e geometry, on operator level only $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{GL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{GL}_3\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{R}_{\neq 0}\times \mathrm{PGL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{PGL}_3\mathbb{R}$ gauge bosons can interact non-trivially with other projective quantum fields from the non- to ultra-relativistic limits. The corresponding propagating, complexified gauge bosons come with the Standard Model gauge group $G_{\mathrm{SM}}=(\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{SU}(3))/\mathbb{Z}_6$. Physical scale transformations can act as global gauge transformations and their spontaneous breaking can lead to masses for the projective quantum fields including the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge bosons. Projective quantum fields, which are irreducible both with respect to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{pgl}_5\mathbb{R}$ and the Poincar\'e group, form Dirac fermions and $G_{\mathrm{SM}}$ gauge bosons interact with them similar to the Standard Model. For homogeneous, curved Lorentz geometries a gauge group similar to the gauge group of metric-affine gravity appears.</description>

      <title>Quintom cosmology and modified gravity after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct the cosmological background evolution under the scenario of dynamical dark energy through the Gaussian process approach, using the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) combined with other observations. Our results reveal that the reconstructed dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w(z)$ exhibits the so-called quintom-B behavior, crossing $-1$ from phantom to quintessence regime as the universe expands. We investigate under what situation this type of evolution could be achieved from the perspectives of field theories and modified gravity. In particular, we reconstruct the corresponding actions for $f(R)$, $f(T)$, and $f(Q)$ gravity, respectively. We explicitly show that, certain modified gravity can exhibit the quintom dynamics and fit the recent DESI data efficiently, and for all cases the quadratic deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario is mildly favored.</description>

Abstract: The cosmological horizon has an associated entropy suggesting that it might encode a quantum mechanical system on its surface. This has motivated extending the principles of the anti-de Sitter (AdS) space/ conformal field theory (CFT) correspondence to static patch holography. Some of our understanding of the AdS/CFT holography has been catalyzed by exploring the geometric duals to quantum information observables in the CFT side of the correspondence. In particular, holographic complexity captures the evolution of the black hole interior, which is conjectured to be dual to a measure of the difficulty in preparing a quantum circuit on the CFT side. Motivated by these developments, we will propose complexity observables defined in geometric terms for an asymptotically dS spacetime and its putative quantum mechanical dual system. To sharply define complexity observables in the static patch of dS space, they will be anchored to a time-like Dirichlet surface where the dual theory is located, called the stretched horizon. While static patch holography needs much more development in order to reach a level of understanding of the likes of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we hope that the work reported in this thesis allows for crucial steps in this direction.</description>
