      <title>On the Number of Vertices in a Hyperplane Section of a Polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the slices or sections of a convex polytope by affine hyperplanes. We present results on two key problems: First, we provide tight bounds on the maximum number of vertices attainable by a hyperplane slice of $d$-polytope (a sort of upper bound theorem) and discuss a new algorithm to find all sections. Second, we investigate the sequence of numbers of vertices produced by the different slices over all possible hyperplanes and analyze the gaps that arise in that sequence. We study these sequences for three-dimensional polytopes and for hypercubes. Our results were obtained with the help of large computational experiments, and we report on new data generated for hypercubes.</description>

      <title>Latin Squares whose transversals share many entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, for all even $n\geq10$, there exists a latin square of order $n$ with at least one transversal, yet all transversals coincide on $ \big\lfloor n/6 \big\rfloor$ entries. These latin squares have at least $ 19 n^2/36 + O(n)$ transversal-free entries. We also prove that for all odd $m\geq 3$, there exists a latin square of order $n=3m$ divided into nine $m\times m$ subsquares, where every transversal hits each of these subsquares at least once.</description>

      <title>Arborescences of Random Covering Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12633v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rooted arborescence of a directed graph is a spanning tree directed towards a particular vertex. A recent work of Chepuri et al. showed that the arborescences of a covering graph of a directed graph G are closely related to the arborescences of G. In this paper, we study the weighted sum of arborescences of a random covering graph and give a formula for the expected value, resolving a conjecture of Chepuri et al.</description>

      <title>Fast construction of self-avoiding polygons and efficient evaluation of closed walk fractions on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build upon a recent theoretical breakthrough by employing novel algorithms to accurately compute the fractions $F_p$ of all closed walks on the infinite square lattice whose the last erased loop corresponds is any one of the $762, 207, 869, 373$ self-avoiding polygons $p$ of length at most 38. Prior to this work, only 6 values of $F_p$ had been calculated in the literature. The main computational engine uses efficient algorithms for both the construction of self-avoiding polygons and the precise evaluation of the lattice Green's function. Based on our results, we propose two conjectures: one regarding the asymptotic behavior of sums of $F_p$, and another concerning the value of $F_p$ when $p$ is a large square. We provide strong theoretical arguments supporting the second conjecture. Furthermore, the algorithms we introduce are not limited to the square lattice and can, in principle, be extended to any vertex-transitive infinite lattice. In establishing this extension, we resolve two open questions related to the triangular lattice Green's function.</description>

      <title>Constructions of minimally $t$-tough regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-complete graph $G$ is said to be $t$-tough if for every vertex cut $S$ of $G$, the ratio of $|S|$ to the number of components of $G-S$ is at least $t$. The toughness $\tau(G)$ of the graph $G$ is the maximum value of $t$ such that $G$ is $t$-tough. A graph $G$ is said to be minimally $t$-tough if $\tau(G)=t$ and $\tau(G-e)&lt;t$ for every $e\in E(G)$. In 2003, Kriesell conjectured that every minimally $1$-tough graph contains a vertex of degree $2$. In 2018, Katona and Varga generalized this conjecture, asserting that every minimally $t$-tough graph contains a vertex of degree $\lceil 2t \rceil$. Recently, Zheng and Sun disproved the generalized Kriesell conjecture by constructing a family of $4$-regular graphs of even order. They also raised the question of whether there exist other minimally $t$-tough regular graphs that do not satisfy the generalized Kriesell conjecture. In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer by constructing a family of $4$-regular graphs of odd order, as well as a family of 6-regular graphs of order $3k+1~(k\geq 5)$.</description>

      <title>Partitions of Graphs into Special Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of partitioning the edge set of a graph into bipartite subgraphs under certain constraints defined by forbidden subgraphs. These constraints lead to both classical, such as partitioning into independent matchings and complete bipartite subgraphs, and novel partitioning problems. The theoretical framework we provide is motivated by clustering problems of real-world transaction graphs, which can naturally be formulated as edge partitioning problems under certain bipartite graph constraints.</description>

      <title>Maximize the Steklov eigenvalue of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximal Steklov eigenvalues of trees with given number of boundary vertices and total number of vertices. Trees can be regarded as discrete analogue of Hadamard manifolds, namely simply-connected Riemannian manifolds of non-positive sectional curvature. Let $\sigma_{k,\text{max}}(b, n)$ be the maximal of $k$-th Steklov eigenvalue of trees with $b$ leaves and $n$ vertices. We determine that $$
  \sigma_{2, \text{max}} (b, n) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{2}{n-1}, &amp; b=2, n\geq 3,
  \frac{1}{r}, &amp; b \geq 3, br + k, 3 - b \leq k \leq 2, r \in \mathbb{Z}_+,
  \frac{1}{r+1-\frac{1}{b}}, &amp; b \geq 3, n = br + 2, r \in \mathbb{Z}_+,
  \end{cases} $$ and we characterize the trees attaining this bound. For $k \geq 3$, we show that $\sigma_{k, \text{max}} (b, n) = 1$. We also give a lower bound on the maximal Steklov eigenvalues of trees with given diameter and total number of vertices. Our work can be regarded as a completion of the work by He--Hua [Upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues on trees, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations (2022)] and Yu--Yu [Monotonicity of Steklov eigenvalues on graphs and applications, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations (2024)].</description>

      <title>Forcing Graphs to be Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sidorenko's conjecture states that the number of copies of any given bipartite graph in another graph of given density is asymptotically minimized by a random graph. The forcing conjecture further strengthens this, claiming that any minimizer in fact needs to be quasi-random. Here we extend the family of bipartite graphs for which the forcing conjecture is known to hold to include balanced blow-ups of Sidorenko graphs and subdivisions of Sidorenko graphs by a forcing graph. This partially generalizes results by Conlon et al. (2018) and Conlon and Lee (2021). We also show that the box product of a Sidorenko graph with an edge is forcing, partially generalizing results of Kim, Lee, and Lee (2016) and, in particular, showing that cubes are forcing. We achieve these results through algebraic arguments building on Razborov's flag algebra framework (2007). This approach additionally allows us to construct Sidorenko hypergraphs from known 2-uniform Sidorenko graphs and to study forcing pairs.</description>

      <title>A partial proof of the Brouwer's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges and let $k$ be a natural number such that $k\leq n.$ Brouwer conjectured that the sum of the $k$ largest Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$ is at most $m+{k+1 \choose 2}.$ In this paper we prove that this conjecture is true for simple $(m,n)$-graphs where $n\leq m\leq \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{4}(n-1)n$ and $k\in \left[ \sqrt[3]{\frac{8m^{2}}{n-1}+4mn+n^{2}}, n\right].$ Moreover, we prove that the conjecture is true for all simple $(m,n)$-graphs where $k (\leq n)$ is a natural number from the interval $\left[\sqrt{2n-2m+2\sqrt{2m^{2}+mn(n-1)}},1+\frac{8m^{2}}{n^{2}(n-1)}+\frac{4m}{n}\right].$</description>

      <title>Graph Burning On Large $p$-Caterpillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph burning models the spread of information or contagion in a graph. At each time step, two events occur: neighbours of already burned vertices become burned, and a new vertex is chosen to be burned. The big conjecture is known as the {\it burning number conjecture}: for any connected graph on $n$ vertices, all $n$ vertices can be burned after at most $\lceil \sqrt{n}\ \rceil$ time steps. It is well-known that to prove the conjecture, it suffices to prove it for trees. We prove the conjecture for sufficiently large $p$-caterpillars.</description>

      <title>The free product of $q$-matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the free product of $q$-matroids, which is the $q$-analogue of the free product of matroids. We study the properties of this noncommutative binary operation, making an extensive use of the theory of cyclic flats. We show that the free product of two $q$-matroids $M_1$ and $M_2$ is maximal with respect to the weak order on $q$-matroids having $M_1$ as a restriction and $M_2$ as the complementary contraction. We characterise $q$-matroids that are irreducible with respect to the free product and we prove that the factorization of a $q$-matroid into a free product of irreducibles is unique up to isomorphism. We discuss the representability of the free product, with a particular focus on rank one uniform $q$-matroids and show that such a product is represented by clubs on the projective line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a determinantal formula for the higher derivative of a quotient of two functions, we first deduce the determinantal expressions of Eulerian polynomials and Andre polynomials. We then investigate the determinantal representations of the up-down run polynomials and the types A and B alternating run polynomials. As applications, we deduce several new recurrence relations, which imply the multiplicity of -1 in these three kinds of polynomials. And then, we provide two determinantal representations for the alternating run polynomials of dual Stirling permutations. In particular, we discover a colse connection between the alternating run polynomials of dual Stirling permutations and the type B Eulerian polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the Rigidity of Random Graphs in high-dimensional spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximum dimension $d=d(n,p)$ for which an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi $G(n,p)$ random graph is $d$-rigid. Our main results reveal two different regimes of rigidity in $G(n,p)$ separated at $p_c=C_*\log n/n,~C_*=2/(1-\log 2)$ -- the point where the graph's minimum degree exceeds half its average degree. We show that if $p &lt; (1-\varepsilon)p_c $, then $d(n,p)$ is asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) equal to the minimum degree of $G(n,p)$. In contrast, if $p_c \leq p = o(n^{-1/2}) $ then $d(n,p) $ is a.a.s. equal to $(1/2 + o(1))np$. The second result confirms, in this regime, a conjecture of Krivelevich, Lew, and Michaeli.</description>

      <title>The $S_n$-equivariant Euler characteristic of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the $S_n$-equivariant topological Euler characteristic of the Kontsevich moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$. Letting $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}^{\mathrm{nrt}}(\mathbb{P}^r, d) \subset \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}(\P^r, d)$ denote the subspace of maps from curves without rational tails, we solve for the motive of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ in terms of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}^{\mathrm{nrt}}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ and plethysm with a genus-zero contribution determined by Getzler and Pandharipande. Fixing a generic $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action on $\mathbb{P}^r$, we derive a closed formula for the Euler characteristic of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}^{\mathrm{nrt}}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ as an $S_n$-equivariant virtual mixed Hodge structure, which leads to our main formula for the Euler characteristic of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$. Our approach connects the geometry of torus actions on Kontsevich moduli spaces with symmetric functions in Coxeter types $A$ and $B$, as well as the enumeration of graph colourings with prescribed symmetry. We also prove a structural result about the $S_n$-equivariant Euler characteristic of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ in arbitrary genus.</description>

      <title>Points on Rational Normal Curves and the ABCT Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ABCT variety is defined as the closure of the image of $G(2,n)$ under the Veronese map. We realize the ABCT variety $V(3,n)$ as the determinantal variety of a vector bundle morphism. We use this to give a recursive formula for the fundamental class of $V(3,n)$. As an application, we show that special Schubert coefficients of this class are given by Eulerian numbers, matching a formula by Cachazo-He-Yuan. On the way to this, we prove that the variety of configuration of points on a common divisor on a smooth variety is reduced and irreducible, generalizing a result of Caminata-Moon-Schaffler.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Patterns in Mixed Linear Layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ordered graph is a graph with a total order over its vertices. A linear layout of an ordered graph is a partition of the edges into sets of either non-crossing edges, called stacks, or non-nesting edges, called queues. The stack (queue) number of an ordered graph is the minimum number of required stacks (queues). Mixed linear layouts combine these layouts by allowing each set of edges to form either a stack or a queue. The minimum number of stacks plus queues is called the mixed page number. It is well known that ordered graphs with small stack number are characterized, up to a function, by the absence of large twists (that is, pairwise crossing edges). Similarly, ordered graphs with small queue number are characterized by the absence of large rainbows (that is, pairwise nesting edges). However, no such characterization via forbidden patterns is known for mixed linear layouts.
  We address this gap by introducing patterns similar to twists and rainbows, which we call thick patterns; such patterns allow a characterization, again up to a function, of mixed linear layouts of bounded-degree graphs. That is, we show that a family of ordered graphs with bounded maximum degree has bounded mixed page number if and only if the size of the largest thick pattern is bounded. In addition, we investigate an exact characterization of ordered graphs whose mixed page number equals a fixed integer $ k $ via a finite set of forbidden patterns. We show that for every $ k \ge 2 $, there is no such characterization, which supports the nature of our first result.</description>

Abstract: We show that the braid group associated to the complex reflection group $G(d,d,n)$ is an index $d$ subgroup of the braid group of the orbifold quotient of the complex numbers by a cyclic group of order $d$. We also give a compatible presentation of $G(d,d,n)$ and its braid group for each tagged triangulation of the disk with $n$ marked points on its boundary and an interior marked point (interpreted as a cone point of degree $d$) in such a way that the presentations of Brou\'{e}-Malle-Rouquier correspond to a special tagged triangulation.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the decay of the Laplace-P\'olya integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laplace-P\'olya integral, defined by $J_n(r) = \frac1\pi\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}^n t \cos(rt) \mathrm{d} t$, appears in several areas of mathematics. We study this quantity by combinatorial methods; accordingly, our investigation focuses on the values at integer $r$'s. Our main result establishes a lower bound for the ratio $\frac{J_n(r+2)}{J_n(r)}$ which extends and generalises the previous estimates of Lesieur and Nicolas obtained by involved analytic methods, and provides a natural counterpart to the upper estimate established in our previous work. We derive the statement by purely combinatorial, elementary arguments. As a corollary, we deduce that no subdiagonal central sections of the unit cube are extremal, apart from the minimal, maximal, and the main diagonal sections. We also prove several consequences for Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present manuscript we address and solve for the first time a nonlocal discrete isoperimetric problem. We consider indeed a generalization of the classical perimeter, what we call a nonlocal bi-axial discrete perimeter, where, not only the external boundary of a polyomino $\mathcal{P}$ contributes to the perimeter, but all internal and external components of $\mathcal{P}$. Furthermore, we find and characterize its minimizers in the class of polyominoes with fixed area $n$. Moreover, we explain how the solution of the nonlocal discrete isoperimetric problem is related to the rigorous study of the metastable behavior of a long-range bi-axial Ising model.</description>

      <title>Time-Biased Random Walks and Robustness of Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walks on expanders play a crucial role in Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, derandomization, graph theory, and distributed computing. A desirable property is that they are rapidly mixing, which is equivalent to having a spectral gap $\gamma$ (asymptotically) bounded away from $0$. Our work has two main strands.
  First, we establish a dichotomy for the robustness of mixing times on edge-weighted $d$-regular graphs (i.e., reversible Markov chains) subject to a Lipschitz condition, which bounds the ratio of adjacent weights by $\beta \geq 1$. If $\beta \ge 1$ is sufficiently small, then $\gamma \asymp 1$ and the mixing time is logarithmic in $n$. On the other hand, if $\beta \geq 2d$, there is an edge-weighting such that $\gamma$ is polynomially small in $1/n$.
  Second, we apply our robustness result to a time-dependent version of the so-called $\varepsilon$-biased random walk, as introduced in Azar et al. [Combinatorica 1996]. We show that, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, a bias strategy can be chosen adaptively so that the $\varepsilon$-biased random walk covers any bounded-degree regular expander in $\Theta(n)$ expected time, improving the previous-best bound of $O(n \log \log n)$. We prove the first non-trivial lower bound on the cover time of the $\varepsilon$-biased random walk, showing that, on bounded-degree regular expanders, it is $\omega(n)$ whenever $\varepsilon = o(1)$. We establish this by controlling how much the probability of arbitrary events can be ``boosted'' by using a time-dependent bias strategy.</description>

      <title>Homological algebra of Nakayama algebras and 321-avoiding permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Nakayama algebras over a field $K$ are in natural bijection to Dyck paths and Dyck paths are in natural bijection to 321-avoiding bijections via the Billey-Jockusch-Stanley bijection. Thus to every 321-avoiding permutation $\pi$ we can associate in a natural way a linear Nakayama algebra $A_{\pi}$. We give a homological interpretation of the fixed points statistic of 321-avoiding permutations using Nakayama algebras with a linear quiver. We furthermore show that the space of self-extension for the Jacobson radical of a linear Nakayama algebra $A_{\pi}$ is isomorphic to $K^{\mathfrak{s}(\pi)}$, where $\mathfrak{s}(\pi)$ is defined as the cardinality $k$ such that $\pi$ is the minimal product of transpositions of the form $s_i=(i,i+1)$ and $k$ is the number of distinct $s_i$ that appear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $H$ and an $n$-vertex graph $G$, the $H$-bootstrap process on $G$ is the process which starts with $G$ and, at every time step, adds any missing edges on the vertices of $G$ that complete a copy of $H$. This process eventually stabilises and we are interested in the extremal question raised by Bollob\'as of determining the maximum running time (number of time steps before stabilising) of this process over all possible choices of $n$-vertex graph $G$. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of the asymptotics of this parameter, denoted $M_H(n)$, and its dependence on properties of the graph $H$. Our focus is on $H$ which define relatively fast bootstrap processes, that is, with $M_H(n)$ being at most linear in $n$. We study the graph class of trees, showing that one can bound $M_T(n)$ by a quadratic function in $v(T)$ for all trees $T$ and all $n$. We then go on to explore the relationship between the running time of the $H$-process and the minimum vertex degree and connectivity of $H$.</description>

Abstract: Fix a finite alphabet. A necklace is a circular word. For positive integers $n$ and~$k$, a necklace is $(n,k)$-perfect if all words of length $n$ occur $k$ times but at positions with different congruence modulo $k$, for any convention of the starting position. We define the notion of a Lyndon pair and we use it to construct the lexicographically greatest $(n,k)$-perfect necklace, for any $n$ and $k$ such that $n$ divides~$k$ or $k$ divides~$n$. Our construction generalizes Fredricksen and Maiorana's construction of the lexicographically greatest de Bruijn sequence of order $n$, based on the concatenation of the Lyndon words whose length divide $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a finite field, and $\mathcal{F}$ a family consisting of $k$-subspaces of $V$. The family $\mathcal{F}$ is called $t$-intersecting if $\dim(F_{1}\cap F_{2})\geq t$ for any $F_{1}, F_{2}\in \mathcal{F}$. We say $\mathcal{F}$ is $s$-almost $t$-intersecting if for each $F\in \mathcal{F}$ there are at most $s$ members $F^{\prime}$ of $\mathcal{F}$ such that $\dim(F\cap F^{\prime})&lt;t$. In this paper, we prove that $s$-almost $t$-intersecting families with maximum size are $t$-intersecting. We also consider $s$-almost $t$-intersecting families which are not $t$-intersecting, and characterize such families with maximum size for $(s,t)\neq(1,1)$. The result for $1$-almost $1$-intersecting families provided by Shan and Zhou is generalized.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of minimal transversals of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating all minimal transversals (also called minimal hitting sets) of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. An equivalent formulation of this problem known as the \emph{transversal hypergraph} problem (or \emph{hypergraph dualization} problem) is to decide, given two hypergraphs, whether one corresponds to the set of minimal transversals of the other. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem is a long standing open question. In \cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete.
  In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.</description>

Abstract: Let $\lambda=(\lambda_1 \geqslant \ldots \geqslant \lambda_k &gt; 0)$. For any $c$ Coxeter element of $\mathfrak{S}_{\lambda_1+k-1}$, we construct a bijection from fillings of $\lambda$ to reverse plane partitions. We recover two previous generalizations of the Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence for particular choices of Coxeter element depending on $\lambda$: one based on the work of, among others, Burge, Hillman, Grassl, Knuth, and uniformly presented by Gansner; the other developed by Garver, Partrias, and Thomas, and independently by Dauvergne, called Scrambled RSK. Our results in this paper develop the combinatorial consequence of our previous work of type $A_{\lambda_1+k}$ quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing the strong Lefschetz property for an $\mathbb{N}$-graded algebra, we introduce the multigraded strong Lefschetz property for an $\mathbb{N}^m$-graded algebra. We show that, for $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{N}^m_+$, the generic $\mathbb{N}^m$-graded Artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring of an $\mathbf{a}$-balanced homology sphere over a field of characteristic $2$ satisfies the multigraded strong Lefschetz property. A corollary is the inequality $h_{\mathbf{b}} \leq h_{\mathbf{c}}$ for $\mathbf{b} \leq \mathbf{c} \leq \mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}$ among the flag $h$-numbers of an $\mathbf{a}$-balanced simplicial sphere. This can be seen as a common generalization of the unimodality of the $h$-vector of a simplicial sphere by Adiprasito and the balanced generalized lower bound inequality by Juhnke-Kubitzke and Murai. We further generalize these results to $\mathbf{a}$-balanced homology manifolds and $\mathbf{a}$-balanced simplicial cycles over a field of characteristic $2$.</description>

Abstract: Postnikov--Stanley polynomials $D_u^w$ are a generalization of skew dual Schubert polynomials to the setting of arbitrary Weyl groups. We prove that Postnikov--Stanley polynomials are Lorentzian by showing that they are degree polynomials of Richardson varieties. Our result yields an interesting class of Lorentzian polynomials related to the geometry of Richardson varieties, generalizes the result that dual Schubert polynomials are Lorentzian (Huh--Matherne--M\'esz\'aros--St. Dizier 2022), and resolves the conjecture that Postnikov--Stanley polynomials have M-convex support (An--Tung--Zhang 2024).</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new generalization of Wythoff Nim using three piles of stones. We show that its P-positions have finite difference properties and produce a partition of positive integers. Further, we give a conjecture that the P-positions approximate a half-line whose slope is described by algebraic numbers of degree 5.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz duality for local cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the 1974 paper by Peskine and Szpiro, liaison theory via complete intersections, and more generally via Gorenstein varieties, has become a standard tool kit in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, allowing to compare algebraic features of linked varieties. In this paper we develop a liaison theory via quasi-Gorenstein varieties, a much broader class than Gorenstein varieties: it is not misleading to think that quasi-Gorenstein rings are to Gorenstein rings as manifolds are to spheres. As applications, we derive a connectedness property of quasi-Gorenstein subspace arrangements generalizing previous results by Benedetti and the second author, and we deduce the classical topological Lefschetz duality via the Stanley-Reisner correspondence.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the commuting graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The commuting graph of a group $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the elements of $G$, two distinct vertices joined if they commute.
  Our purpose in this paper is twofold: we discuss the computational problem of deciding whether a given graph is the commuting graph of a finite group; we give a quasipolynomial algorithm, and a polynomial algorithm for the case when the group is an extra\-special p-group for p an odd prime; we give new results on the question of whether the commuting graph of a given group is a cograph or a chordal graph, two classes of graphs defined by forbidden subgraphs.
  The problems are not unrelated, since there are a number of cases where hard computational problems on graphs are easier when restricted to special classes of graphs; we conjecture that the recognition problem is polynomial for cographs and chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Canonically Jordan recoverable categories for modules over the path algebra of $A_n$ type quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be a quiver of $A_n$ type and $\mathbb{K}$ be an algebraically closed field. A nilpotent endomorphism of a quiver representation induces a linear transformation of the vector space at each vertex. Generically among all nilpotent endomorphisms of a fixed representation $X$, there exists a well-defined Jordan form of each of these linear transformations $\operatorname{GenJF}(X)$, called the generic Jordan form data of $X$. A subcategory of $\operatorname{rep}(Q)$ is Jordan recoverable if we can recover $X$ up to isomorphism from its generic Jordan form data.
  There is a procedure which allows one to invert the map from representations to generic Jordan form data. The subcategories for which this procedure works are called canonically Jordan recoverable. We focus on the subcategories of $\operatorname{rep}(Q)$ that are canonically Jordan recoverable, and we give a combinatorial characterization of them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a correspondence between the higher Bruhat orders of Yu. I. Manin and V. Schechtman, and the cup-$i$ coproducts defining Steenrod squares in cohomology. To any element of the higher Bruhat orders we associate a coproduct, recovering Steenrod's original ones from extremal elements in these orders. Defining this correspondence involves interpreting the coproducts geometrically in terms of zonotopal tilings, which allows us to give conceptual proofs of their properties and show that all reasonable coproducts arise from our construction.</description>

      <title>Neighbour Sum Patterns : Chessboards to Toroidal Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a chessboard filled with integer entries satisfies the neighbour-sum property if the number appearing on each cell is the sum of entries in its neighbouring cells, where neighbours are cells sharing a common edge or vertex. We show that an $n\times n$ chessboard satisfies this property if and only if $n\equiv 5\pmod 6$. Existence of solutions is further investigated of rectangular, toroidal boards, as well as on Neumann neighbourhoods, including a nice connection to discrete harmonic functions. Construction of solutions on infinite boards are also presented. Finally, answers to three dimensional analogues of these boards are explored using properties of cyclotomic polynomials and relevant ideas conjectured.</description>

      <title>On a combinatorial classification of fine compactified universal Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending the definition of $V$-stability conditions, given by Viviani in a recent preprint, we introduce the notion of universal stability conditions. Building on results by Pagani and Tommasi, we show that fine compactified universal Jacobians, that is, fine compactified Jacobians over the moduli spaces of stable pointed curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$, are combinatorially classified by universal stability conditions.
  We use these stability conditions to show the following. The inclusion of fine compactified universal Jacobians of type $(g,n)$ whose fibres over geometric points are classical, that is, they are constructed by some numerical polarisations, into the class of all fine compactified universal Jacobians, is strict, in general, for any $g\geq 2$. This answers a question of Pagani and Tommasi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A function is boundedly finite-to-one if there is a natural number $k$ such that each point has at most $k$ inverse images. In this paper, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (i.e., the Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice) several results concerning this notion, among which are the following:
  (1) For each infinite set $A$ and natural number $n$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{S}(A)$ to $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$, where $\mathcal{S}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ and $\mathcal{S}_{\leq n}(A)$ is the set of all permutations of $A$ moving at most $n$ points.
  (2) For each infinite set $A$, there is no boundedly finite-to-one function from $\mathcal{B}(A)$ to $\mathrm{fin}(A)$, where $\mathcal{B}(A)$ is the set of all partitions of $A$ such that every block is finite and $\mathrm{fin}(A)$ is the set of all finite subsets of $A$.</description>

      <title>Relative volume of comparable pairs under semigroup majorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a permutation group on the finite set $\Omega$. We prove various results about partitions of $\Omega$ whose stabilizers have good properties. In particular, we obtain the following three theorems: In every solvable permutation group, there is a subset whose stabilizer has all orbits of length at most $6$, which is best possible and answers two questions of Babai. Every solvable maximal subgroup of any almost simple group has derived length at most $10$, which is best possible. In every primitive group with solvable stabilizer, there are two points whose pointwise stabilizer has derived length bounded by an absolute constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a combinatorial object that can be associated with any conic-line arrangement with ordinary singularities, which we call the combinatorial Poincar\'e polynomial. We prove a Terao-type factorization statement on the splitting of such a polynomial over the rationals under the assumption that our conic-line arrangements are free and admit ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities. Then we focus on the so-called $d$-arrangements in the plane. In particular, we provide a combinatorial constraint for free $d$-arrangements admitting ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities.</description>
