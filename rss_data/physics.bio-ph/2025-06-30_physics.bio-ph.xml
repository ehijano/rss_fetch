      <title>Single-Trajectory Bayesian Modeling Reveals Multi-State Diffusion of the MSH Sliding Clamp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is the essential mechanism for preserving genomic integrity in various living organisms. In this process, MutS homologs (MSH) play crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting downstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and diffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while traversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans DNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing a mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding clamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the sliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the diffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle tracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling framework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the diffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion mechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct diffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These states alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly involving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest and the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics reflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp, highlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated.</description>

      <title>Vegetation Patterning Can Both Impede and Trigger Critical Transitions from Savanna to Grassland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-grass coexistence is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, which play an important role in supporting biodiversity and human populations worldwide. While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying processes, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under environmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyze a minimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas. We incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing with trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that these mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna and grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns consisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental conditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the model predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a phenomenon called ''Turing-evades-tipping''). Additionally, we identify a novel ''Turing-triggers-tipping'' mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives tipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included. These transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem transitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical and empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent tipping or drive collapse.</description>

      <title>Manifold-based transformation of probability distributions: application to the inverse problem of reconstructing distributions from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information geometry is a mathematical framework that elucidates the manifold structure of the probability distribution space (p-space), providing a systematic approach to transforming probability distributions (PDs). In this study, we utilized information geometry to address the inverse problems associated with reconstructing PDs from experimental data. Our initial finding is that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, often considered non-metric owing to its asymmetry, can serve as a valid metric under specific geometric conditions on the manifold. Based on this finding, we formulated the manifold-based gradient descent (MBGD) method, which was employed to visualize the internal structures -- represented as PDs -- of two types of systems: those with static constituent elements and those with dynamic state transitions. Through the application of MBGD, we successfully reconstructed the underlying PDs for both types of systems, outperforming the standard gradient descent methods that neglect the manifold structure of p-space. Therefore, the present results demonstrate the essentiality of accounting for the manifold structure of p-space in the inverse problems of reconstructing PDs. The ability of MBGD to accurately reconstruct PDs for systems with dynamic state transitions underscores its potential to provide valuable physical insights by visualizing internal structures.</description>

      <title>Sequential binding-unbinding based specific interactions influence exchange dynamics and size distribution of protein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction lifetimes between condensate-forming biomolecules can dictate both the specificity of the condensate-forming species as well as the fluidity and exchange dynamics of these condensates. Using a heuristic modeling approach, we show that single-step vs. sequential, multistep binding-unbinding interactions between proteins can lead to similar average interaction lifetimes, but with either exponential or truncated power-law-like lifetime distributions, respectively. Combining this model with Brownian dynamics simulations, we find that the differences in these lifetime distributions influence the features of condensates, such as their fluidic nature, aging, and size distribution.</description>
