      <title>Relativistic chaotic scattering: unveiling scaling laws for trapped trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study different types of phase space structures which appear in the context of relativistic chaotic scattering. By using the relativistic version of the H\'{e}non-Heiles Hamiltonian, we numerically study the topology of different kind of exit basins and compare it with the case of low velocities in which the Newtonian version of the system is valid. Specifically, we numerically study the escapes in the phase space, in the energy plane and also in the $\beta$ plane which richly characterize the dynamics of the system. In all cases, fractal structures are present, and the escaping dynamics is characterized. Besides, in every case a scaling law is numerically obtained in which the percentage of the trapped trajectories as a function of the relativistic parameter $\beta$ and the energy is obtained. Our work could be useful in the context of charged particles which eventually can be trapped in the magnetosphere, where the analysis of these structures can be relevant.</description>

      <title>Signal-noise separation using unsupervised reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Removing noise from a signal without knowing the characteristics of the noise is a challenging task. This paper introduces a signal-noise separation method based on time series prediction. We use Reservoir Computing (RC) to extract the maximum portion of "predictable information" from a given signal. Reproducing the deterministic component of the signal using RC, we estimate the noise distribution from the difference between the original signal and reconstructed one. The method is based on a machine learning approach and requires no prior knowledge of either the deterministic signal or the noise distribution. It provides a way to identify additivity/multiplicativity of noise and to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) indirectly. The method works successfully for combinations of various signal and noise, including chaotic signal and highly oscillating sinusoidal signal which are corrupted by non-Gaussian additive/ multiplicative noise. The separation performances are robust and notably outstanding for signals with strong noise, even for those with negative SNR.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Reduction to Temporally Aperiodic Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of spectral submanifolds (SSMs) to general non-autonomous dynamical systems that are either weakly forced or slowly varying. Examples of such systems arise in structural dynamics, fluid-structure interactions and control problems. The time-dependent SSMs we construct under these assumptions are normally hyperbolic and hence will persist for larger forcing and faster time dependence that are beyond the reach of our precise existence theory. For this reason, we also derive formal asymptotic expansions that, under explicitly verifiable nonresonance conditions, approximate SSMs and their aperiodic anchor trajectories accurately for stronger, faster or even temporally discontinuous forcing. Reducing the dynamical system to these persisting SSMs provides a mathematically justified model reduction technique for non-autonomous physical systems whose time dependance is moderate either in magnitude or speed. We illustrate the existence, persistence and computation of temporally aperiodic SSMs in mechanical examples under chaotic forcing.</description>

      <title>Complex network approach to the turbulent velocity gradient dynamics: High- and low-probability Lagrangian paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of the turbulent velocity gradient tensor (VGT) is essential to gain insights into the Navier-Stokes equations and improve small-scale turbulence modeling. However, characterizing the VGT dynamics conditional on all its relevant invariants in a continuous fashion is extremely difficult. In this paper, we represent the VGT Lagrangian dynamics using a network where each node represents a unique flow state. This approach enables us to discern how the VGT transitions from one state to another in a simplified fashion. Our analysis reveals intriguing features of the resulting network, such as the clustering of the commonly visited nodes where the eigenvalues of the VGT are real, in the proximity of the Vieillefosse tail. We then relate our complex network approach to the well-established VGT discretization based on the sign of its principal invariants, $Q$ and $R$, and its discriminant, $\Delta$. To this end, we separate the shortest paths on the network (geodesics) based on the $Q$-$R$ region to which their starting and arrival nodes belong. The distribution of the length of intra-region geodesics, with starting and arrival nodes belonging to the same $Q$-$R$ region, exhibits a distinct bimodality in two regions of the $Q$-$R$ plane, those in which the deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian introduces complexity to the VGT dynamics. Such bimodality is associated with infrequently visited nodes having to follow a long, low probability path to drastically change the state of the VGT compared to other flow states that can acquire the necessary characteristics without changing their sign for $Q$ or $R$. We complement the geodesics approach by examining random walks on the network, showing how the VGT non-normality and the associated production terms distinguish the shortest commuting paths between different $Q$-$R$ regions.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of a saddle-node bifurcation point for nonlinear equations in general domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a direct method of establishing the existence and uniqueness of saddle-node bifurcations for nonlinear equations in general domains. The method employs the scaled extended quotient whose saddle points correspond to the saddle-node bifurcations. The uniqueness of the saddle-node bifurcation point directly stems from the uniqueness of the saddle point. The method is applied to solving open problems involving the existence and uniqueness of the maximum saddle-node bifurcation for the positive solutions curve to an elliptic boundary value problem with a convex-concave nonlinearity in general domains.</description>

      <title>N-Body Oscillator Interactions of Higher-Order Coupling Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method to identify phase equations that include $N$-body interactions for general coupled oscillators valid far beyond the weak coupling approximation. This strategy is an extension of the theory from [Park and Wilson, SIADS 20.3 (2021)] and yields coupling functions for $N\geq2$ oscillators for arbitrary types of coupling (e.g., diffusive, gap-junction, chemical synaptic). These coupling functions enable the study of oscillator networks in terms of phase-locked states, whose stability can be determined using straightforward linear stability arguments. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with two examples. First, we use $N=3$ diffusively coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) model and show that the loss of stability in its splay state occurs through a Hopf bifurcation \yp{as a function of non-weak diffusive coupling. Our reduction also captures asymptotic limit-cycle dynamics in the phase differences}. Second, we use $N=3$ realistic conductance-based thalamic neuron models and show that our method correctly predicts a loss in stability of a splay state for non-weak synaptic coupling. In both examples, our theory accurately captures model behaviors that weak and recent non-weak coupling theories can not.</description>

      <title>Multiple timestep reversible $N$-body integrators for close encounters in planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new almost time-reversible integrators for solution of planetary systems consisting of "planets" and a dominant mass ("star"). The algorithms can be considered adaptive generalizations of the Wisdom--Holman method, in which all pairs of planets can be assigned timesteps. These timesteps, along with the global timestep, can be adapted time-reversibly, often at no appreciable additional compute cost, without sacrificing any of the long-term error benefits of the Wisdom--Holman method. The method can also be considered a simpler and more flexible version of the \texttt{SYMBA} symplectic code. We perform tests on several challenging problems with close encounters and find the reversible algorithms are up to $2.6$ times faster than a code based on \texttt{SYMBA}. The codes presented here are available on Github. We also find adapting a global timestep reversibly and discretely must be done in block-synchronized manner or similar.</description>
