      <title>On the Bias, Fairness, and Bias Mitigation for a Wearable-based Freezing of Gait Detection in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a cause of injurious falls among PD patients. Recent advances in wearable-based human activity recognition (HAR) technology have enabled the detection of FOG subtypes across benchmark datasets. Since FOG manifestation is heterogeneous, developing models that quantify FOG consistently across patients with varying demographics, FOG types, and PD conditions is important. Bias and fairness in FOG models remain understudied in HAR, with research focused mainly on FOG detection using single benchmark datasets. We evaluated the bias and fairness of HAR models for wearable-based FOG detection across demographics and PD conditions using multiple datasets and the effectiveness of transfer learning as a potential bias mitigation approach. Our evaluation using demographic parity ratio (DPR) and equalized odds ratio (EOR) showed model bias (DPR &amp; EOR &lt; 0.8) for all stratified demographic variables, including age, sex, and disease duration. Our experiments demonstrated that transfer learning from multi-site datasets and generic human activity representations significantly improved fairness (average change in DPR +0.027, +0.039, respectively) and performance (average change in F1-score +0.026, +0.018, respectively) across attributes, supporting the hypothesis that generic human activity representations learn fairer representations applicable to health analytics.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Multi-user Position-Reconfigurable Full-Duplex MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) or movable antenna system (MAS) is an emerging antenna design technique that can fully exploit the wireless channel spatial variation and consequently improve the communication performance, both in terms of achievable rate and hardware cost, via relocating the positions of antennas in a confined region. Full-duplex (FD) communication enables simultaneous transmission and reception over the same time and frequency resource block, which theoretically double the spectral efficiency. The integration of FAS/MAS and FD communication is expected to greatly improve the system capacity and save the spectral and hardware resources.</description>

      <title>Compressive Sensing Empirical Wavelet Transform for Frequency-Banded Power Measurement Considering Interharmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power measurement algorithms based on Fourier transform are susceptible to errors caused by interharmonics, while wavelet transform algorithms are particularly sensitive to even harmonics due to band decomposition effects. The empirical wavelet transform (EWT) has been demonstrated to improve measurement accuracy by effectively partitioning transition bands. However, for detecting interharmonic components, the limitation of the observation time window restricts spectral resolution, thereby limiting measurement accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Compressive Sensing Empirical Wavelet Transform (CSEWT). The approach aims to enhance frequency resolution by integrating compressive sensing with the EWT, allowing precise identification of components across different frequency bands. This enables accurate determination of the power associated with the fundamental frequency, harmonics, and interharmonics. Test results indicate that the proposed CSEWT method can significantly improve the precision of individual frequency component measurements, even under dynamic and noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Port-LLM: A Port Prediction Method for Fluid Antenna based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to address the mobility challenges faced by User Equipment (UE) through the implementation of fluid antenna (FA) on the UE side. This approach aims to maintain the time-varying channel in a relatively stable state by strategically relocating the FA to an appropriate port. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces, for the first time, the application of large language models (LLMs) in the prediction of FA ports, presenting a novel model termed Port-LLM. The proposed method consists of two primary steps for predicting the moving port of the FA: the first involves utilizing the channel tables that encompass historical channel state information from all movable ports of the FA to forecast the channel tables for subsequent time periods; the second step entails selecting the port of the FA for the forthcoming time based on the predicted channel tables and the known reference channels that require alignment. To enhance the learning capabilities of the LLM model in the context of FA port prediction, we incorporate the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology. Furthermore, during the model training phase, we implement the warm-up-aided cosine learning rate (LR) technique to augment the accuracy of the predictions. The simulation results show that our model exhibits strong generalization ability and robustness under different numbers of base station antennas and medium-to-high mobility speeds of UE. In comparison to existing FA port calculation methods, the performance of the port predicted by our model demonstrates superior efficacy. Additionally, our model exhibits lower prediction costs and faster prediction and reasoning speeds.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity On-Grid Channel Estimation for Partially-Connected Hybrid XL-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of channel estimation in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, pivotal for the advancement of 6G communications. XL-MIMO systems, characterized by their vast antenna arrays, necessitate accurate channel state information (CSI) to leverage high spatial multiplexing and beamforming gains. However, conventional channel estimation methods for near-field XL-MIMO encounter significant computational complexity due to the exceedingly high parameter quantization levels needed for estimating the parametric near-field channel. To address this, we propose a low-complexity two-stage on-grid channel estimation algorithm designed for near-field XL-MIMO systems. The first stage focuses on estimating the LoS channel component while treating the NLoS paths as interference. This estimation is accomplished through an alternating subarray-wise array gain maximization (ASAGM) approach based on the piecewise outer product model (SOPM). In the second stage, we estimate the NLoS channel component by utilizing the sensing matrix refinement-based orthogonal matching pursuit (SMR-OMP) algorithm. This approach helps reduce the high computational complexity associated with large-dimensional joint sensing matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed low-complexity method, showcasing its significant superiority over existing near-field XL-MIMO channel estimation techniques, particularly in intermediate and high SNR regimes, and in practical scenarios involving arbitrary array placements.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Localization with Physics-Compliant Electromagnetic Model: Algorithms and Model Mismatch Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate signal localization is critical for Internet of Things applications, but precise propagation models are often unavailable due to uncontrollable factors. Simplified models such as planar and spherical wavefront approximations are widely used but can cause model mismatches that reduce accuracy. To address this, we propose an expected likelihood ratio framework for model mismatch analysis and online model selection without requiring knowledge of the true propagation model. The framework leverages the scenario independent distribution of the likelihood ratio of the actual covariance matrix, enabling the detection of mismatches and outliers by comparing given models to a predefined distribution. When an accurate electromagnetic model is unavailable, the robustness of the framework is analyzed using data generated from a precise electromagnetic model and simplified models within positioning algorithms. Validation in direct localization and reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted scenarios demonstrates the ability to improve localization accuracy and reliably detect model mismatches in diverse Internet of Things environments.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Generative Modeling of Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the distribution of the wireless channel within a specific environment of interest is essential to exploit the full potential of machine learning (ML) for wireless communications and radar applications. Generative modeling offers a promising framework to address this problem. However, existing approaches pose unresolved challenges, including the need for high-quality training data, limited generalizability, and a lack of physical interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a model that combines the physics-related compressibility of wireless channels with sparse Bayesian generative modeling (SBGM) to learn the distribution of the underlying physical channel parameters. By leveraging the sparsity-inducing characteristics of SBGM, our method can learn from compressed observations received by an access point (AP) during default online operation. Moreover, it is physically interpretable and generalizes to arbitrary system configurations without requiring retraining.</description>

      <title>CISSIR: Beam Codebooks with Self-Interference Reduction Guarantees for Integrated Sensing and Communication Beyond 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a beam codebook design to reduce self-interference (SI) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our optimization methods, which can be applied to both tapered beamforming and phased arrays, adapt the codebooks to the SI channel such that a certain SI level is achieved. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound on the quantization noise in terms of the achieved SI level, which provides guidelines to pose the optimization problem in order to obtain performance guarantees for sensing. By selecting standard reference codebooks in our simulations, we show substantially improved sensing quality with little impact on 5G-NR communication. Our proposed method is not only less dependent on hyperparameters than other approaches in the literature, but it can also reduce SI further, and thus deliver better sensing and communication performance.</description>

      <title>Microphone Array Geometry Independent Multi-Talker Distant ASR: NTT System for the DASR Task of the CHiME-8 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi-talker distant automatic speech recognition (DASR) system we designed for the DASR task 1 of the CHiME-8 challenge. Our system performs speaker counting, diarization, and ASR. It handles various recording conditions, from diner parties to professional meetings and from two to eight speakers. We perform diarization first, followed by speech enhancement, and then ASR as the challenge baseline. However, we introduced several key refinements. First, we derived a powerful speaker diarization relying on end-to-end speaker diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC), multi-channel speaker counting using enhanced embeddings from EEND-VC, and target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD). For speech enhancement, we introduced a novel microphone selection rule to better select the most relevant microphones among the distributed microphones and investigated improvements to beamforming. Finally, for ASR, we developed several models exploiting Whisper and WavLM speech foundation models. We present the results we submitted to the challenge and updated results we obtained afterward. Our strongest system achieves a 63% relative macro tcpWER improvement over the baseline and outperforms the challenge best results on the NOTSOFAR-1 meeting evaluation data among geometry-independent systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Phase Estimation in Satellite-to-Earth Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A global continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) network can be established using a series of satellite-to-Earth channels. Increased performance in such a network is provided by performing coherent measurement of the optical quantum signals using a real local oscillator, calibrated locally by encoding known information on transmitted reference pulses and using signal phase error estimation algorithms. The speed and accuracy of the signal phase error estimation algorithm are vital to practical CV-QKD implementation. Our work provides a framework to analyze long short-term memory neural network (NN) architecture parameterization, with respect to the quantum Cram\'er-Rao uncertainty bound of the signal phase error estimation, with a focus on reducing the model complexity. More specifically, we demonstrate that signal phase error estimation can be achieved using a low-complexity NN architecture, without significantly sacrificing accuracy. Our results significantly improve the real-time performance of practical CV-QKD systems deployed over satellite-to-Earth channels, thereby contributing to the ongoing development of the Quantum Internet.</description>

      <title>ELAA-ISAC: Environmental Mapping Utilizing the LoS State of Communication Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel environmental mapping method is proposed to outline the indoor layout utilizing the line-of-sight (LoS) state information of extremely large aperture array (ELAA) channels. It leverages the spatial resolution provided by ELAA and the mobile terminal (MT)'s mobility to infer the presence and location of obstacles in the environment. The LoS state estimation is formulated as a binary hypothesis testing problem, and the optimal decision rule is derived based on the likelihood ratio test. Subsequently, the theoretical error probability of LoS estimation is derived, showing close alignment with simulation results. Then, an environmental mapping method is proposed, which progressively outlines the layout by combining LoS state information from multiple MT locations. It is demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately outline the environment layout, with the mapping accuracy improving as the number of service-antennas and MT locations increases. This paper also investigates the impact of channel estimation error and non-LoS (NLoS) components on the quality of environmental mapping. The proposed method exhibits particularly promising performance in LoS dominated wireless environments characterized by high Rician K-factor. Specifically, it achieves an average intersection over union (IoU) exceeding 80% when utilizing 256 service antennas and 18 MT locations.</description>

      <title>SNR/CRB-Constrained Joint Beamforming and Reflection Designs for RIS-ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for providing wide-coverage and ultra-reliable communication and high-accuracy sensing functions. In particular, we consider an RIS-assisted ISAC system in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) simultaneously performs multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) communications and radar sensing with the assistance of an RIS. We focus on both target detection and parameter estimation performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), respectively. Two optimization problems are formulated for maximizing the achievable sum-rate of the multi-user communications under an SNR constraint for target detection or a CRB constraint for parameter estimation, the transmit power budget, and the unit-modulus constraint of the RIS reflection coefficients. Efficient algorithms are developed to solve these two complicated non-convex problems. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed joint beamforming and reflection designs compared with other schemes. In addition, it is shown that more RIS reflection elements bring larger performance gains for direct-of-arrival (DoA) estimation than for target detection.</description>

      <title>DOA Estimation-Oriented Joint Array Partitioning and Beamforming Designs for ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication has been identified as an enabling technology for forthcoming wireless networks. In an effort to achieve an improved performance trade-off between multiuser communications and radar sensing, this paper considers a dynamically-partitioned antenna array architecture for monostatic ISAC systems, in which each element of the array at the base station can function as either a transmit or receive antenna. To fully exploit the available spatial degrees of freedom for both communication and sensing functions, we jointly design the partitioning of the array between transmit and receive antennas together with the transmit beamforming in order to minimize the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation error, while satisfying constraints on the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the transmit power budget. An alternating algorithm based on Dinkelbach's transform, the alternative direction method of multipliers, and majorization-minimization is developed to solve the resulting complicated optimization problem. To reduce the computational complexity, we also present a heuristic three-step strategy that optimizes the transmit beamforming after determining the antenna partitioning. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in significantly reducing the DOA estimation error.</description>

      <title>Joint Space-Time Adaptive Processing and Beamforming Design for Cell-Free ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore cooperative sensing and communication within cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Specifically, multiple transmit access points (APs) collaboratively serve multiple communication users while simultaneously illuminating a potential target, with a separate sensing AP dedicated to collecting echo signals for target detection. To improve the performance of identifying a moving target in the presence of strong interference originating from transmit APs, we employ the space-time adaptive processing (STAP) technique and jointly optimize the transmit/receive beamforming. Our goal is to maximize the radar output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), subject to the communication SINR requirements and the power budget. An efficient alternating algorithm is developed to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Simulations demonstrate significant performance improvements in target detection and validate the advantages of the proposed joint STAP and beamforming design for cell-free ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Signal Processing and Learning: Recent Advances and Future Challenges</title>

Abstract: Developing methods to process irregularly structured data is crucial in applications like gene-regulatory, brain, power, and socioeconomic networks. Graphs have been the go-to algebraic tool for modeling the structure via nodes and edges capturing their interactions, leading to the establishment of the fields of graph signal processing (GSP) and graph machine learning (GML). Key graph-aware methods include Fourier transform, filtering, sampling, as well as topology identification and spatiotemporal processing. Although versatile, graphs can model only pairwise dependencies in the data. To this end, topological structures such as simplicial and cell complexes have emerged as algebraic representations for more intricate structure modeling in data-driven systems, fueling the rapid development of novel topological-based processing and learning methods. This paper first presents the core principles of topological signal processing through the Hodge theory, a framework instrumental in propelling the field forward thanks to principled connections with GSP-GML. It then outlines advances in topological signal representation, filtering, and sampling, as well as inferring topological structures from data, processing spatiotemporal topological signals, and connections with topological machine learning. The impact of topological signal processing and learning is finally highlighted in applications dealing with flow data over networks, geometric processing, statistical ranking, biology, and semantic communication.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Channel Access and Transmission for NR Sidelink and Wi-Fi Coexistence over Unlicensed Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of various internet of things (IoT) applications, including industrial IoT (IIoT) and visual IoT (VIoT), the demand for direct device-to-device communication to support high data rates continues to grow. To address this demand, 5G-Advanced has introduced sidelink communication over the unlicensed spectrum (SL-U) to increase data rates. However, the primary challenge of SL-U in the unlicensed spectrum is ensuring fair coexistence with other incumbent systems, such as Wi-Fi. In this paper, we address the challenge by designing channel access mechanisms and power control strategies to mitigate interference and ensure fair coexistence. First, we propose a novel collaborative channel access (CCHA) mechanism that integrates channel access with resource allocation through collaborative interactions between base stations (BS) and SL-U users. This mechanism ensures fair coexistence with incumbent systems while improving resource utilization. Second, to further enhance the performance of the coexistence system, we develop a cooperative subgoal-based hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (C-GHDRL) algorithm framework. The framework enables SL-U users to make globally optimal decisions by leveraging cooperative operations between the BS and SL-U users, effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional optimization methods in solving joint optimization problems with nonlinear constraints. Finally, we mathematically model the joint channel access and power control problem and balance the trade-off between fairness and transmission rate in the coexistence system by defining a suitable reward function in the C-GHDRL algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the performance of the coexistence system while ensuring fair coexistence between SL-U and Wi-Fi users.</description>

      <title>Pre-Equalization Aided Grant-Free Massive Access in Massive MIMO System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial diversity and multiplexing advantages of massive multi-input-multi-output (mMIMO) can significantly improve the capacity of massive non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in machine type communications. However, state-of-the-art grant-free massive NOMA schemes for mMIMO systems require accurate estimation of random access channels to perform activity detection and the following coherent data demodulation, which suffers from excessive pilot overhead and access latency. To address this, we propose a pre-equalization aided grant-free massive access scheme for mMIMO systems, where an iterative detection scheme is conceived. Specifically, the base station (BS) firstly activates one of its antennas (i.e., beacon antenna) to broadcast a beacon signal, which facilitates the user equipment (UEs) to perform downlink channel estimation and pre-equalize the uplink random access signal with respect to the channels associated with the beacon antenna. During the uplink transmission stage, the BS detects UEs' activity and data by using the proposed iterative detection algorithm, which consists of three modules: coarse data detection (DD), data-aided channel estimation (CE), and fine DD. In the proposed algorithm, the joint activity and DD is firstly performed based on the signals received by the beacon antenna. Subsequently, the DD is further refined by iteratively performing data-aided CE module and fine DD module using signals received by all BS antennas. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art mMIMO-based grant-free massive NOMA schemes with the same access latency. Simulation codes are provided to reproduce the results in this article: https://github.com/owenwang517/tvt-2025.</description>

      <title>Virtual VNA: Minimal-Ambiguity Scattering Matrix Estimation with a Fixed Set of "Virtual" Load-Tunable Ports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the scattering matrix of an arbitrarily complex linear, passive, time-invariant system with $N$ monomodal lumped ports by inputting and outputting waves only via a fixed set of $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports while terminating the remaining $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ "not-directly-accessible" (NDA) ports with tunable individual loads. First, we present a closed-form approach requiring at least three arbitrary, distinct, and known loads at each NDA port; sign ambiguities on off-diagonal scattering coefficients associated with NDA ports are inevitable. Being matrix-valued, our approach is ideally suited to mitigate noise sensitivity using more accessible ports. It also yields $1+2N_\mathrm{S}+N_S(N_S-1)/2$ as upper bound on the number of required measurements $N_\mathrm{cal}$ for $N_\mathrm{A}&gt;1$ in the low-noise regime. Second, we present a gradient-descent approach using random load configurations, enabling flexible adjustments of $N_\mathrm{cal}$ to further mitigate noise. Third, we present an intensity-only gradient-descent approach, dispensing with phase-sensitive detectors at the expense of an additional blockwise phase ambiguity. Then, we discuss in what applications the inevitable remaining ambiguities are problematic and how to lift them. Finally, we experimentally validate all three approaches with an eight-port reverberation chamber and $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$, systematically assessing the sensitivity to noise and $N_\mathrm{cal}$. We coin our technique "virtual vector network analyzer (VNA)" because it implies that suitably tunable and characterized individual loads can essentially be interpreted as additional "virtual" VNA ports. Our method can characterize static large antenna systems with many and/or embedded ports, but also reconfigurable wave systems; it may further enable wireless sensing in indoor surveillance, non-destructive testing, and bioelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a large-scale dataset for radar adaptive signal processing (RASP) applications to support the development of data-driven models within the adaptive radar community. The dataset, RASPNet, exceeds 16 TB in size and comprises 100 realistic scenarios compiled over a variety of topographies and land types from across the contiguous United States. For each scenario, RASPNet consists of 10,000 clutter realizations from an airborne radar setting, which can be used to benchmark radar and complex-valued learning algorithms. RASPNet intends to fill a prominent gap in the availability of a large-scale, realistic dataset that standardizes the evaluation of adaptive radar processing techniques and complex-valued neural networks. We outline its construction, organization, and several applications, including a transfer learning example to demonstrate how RASPNet can be used for realistic adaptive radar processing scenarios.</description>

      <title>CrossFi: A Cross Domain Wi-Fi Sensing Framework Based on Siamese Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Wi-Fi sensing has garnered significant attention due to its numerous benefits, such as privacy protection, low cost, and penetration ability. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, focusing on areas such as gesture recognition, people identification, and fall detection. However, many data-driven methods encounter challenges related to domain shift, where the model fails to perform well in environments different from the training data. One major factor contributing to this issue is the limited availability of Wi-Fi sensing datasets, which makes models learn excessive irrelevant information and over-fit to the training set. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale Wi-Fi sensing datasets across diverse scenarios is a challenging task. To address this problem, we propose CrossFi, a siamese network-based approach that excels in both in-domain scenario and cross-domain scenario, including few-shot, zero-shot scenarios, and even works in few-shot new-class scenario where testing set contains new categories. The core component of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net, which improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention mechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the distance or cosine similarity. Based on it, we develop an extra Weight-Net that can generate a template for each class, so that our CrossFi can work in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our CrossFi achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. In gesture recognition task, our CrossFi achieves an accuracy of 98.17% in in-domain scenario, 91.72% in one-shot cross-domain scenario, 64.81% in zero-shot cross-domain scenario, and 84.75% in one-shot new-class scenario. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/CrossFi.</description>

      <title>UAV Communications: Impact of Obstacles on Channel Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as effective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with high Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications will rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by obstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is positioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To ensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS, and establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be integrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a simulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG) channel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel perspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput, packet delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed positioning approach.</description>

      <title>Learning to Predict Global Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics from Sparse Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Catheter ablation of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) consists of a one-size-fits-all treatment with limited success in persistent AF. This may be due to our inability to map the dynamics of AF with the limited resolution and coverage provided by sequential contact mapping catheters, preventing effective patient phenotyping for personalised, targeted ablation. Here we introduce FibMap, a graph recurrent neural network model that reconstructs global AF dynamics from sparse measurements. Trained and validated on 51 non-contact whole atria recordings, FibMap reconstructs whole atria dynamics from 10% surface coverage, achieving a 210% lower mean absolute error and an order of magnitude higher performance in tracking phase singularities compared to baseline methods. Clinical utility of FibMap is demonstrated on real-world contact mapping recordings, achieving reconstruction fidelity comparable to non-contact mapping. FibMap's state-spaces and patient-specific parameters offer insights for electrophenotyping AF. Integrating FibMap into clinical practice could enable personalised AF care and improve outcomes.</description>
