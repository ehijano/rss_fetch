      <title>Anomalies in Muon-Induced Neutron Emissions from Pb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses neutron multiplicity spectra from massive targets at depths of 3, 40, 210, 583, 1166, and 4000 m.w.e. The measurements, conducted between 2001 and 2024, utilised three experimental setups with either 14 or 60 He-3 neutron detectors and lead (Pb) targets weighing 306, 565, or 1134 kg. The total acquisition time exceeded six years. When available, the acquired spectra were compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Our data challenges the practice of approximating the muon-induced neutron multiplicity spectra with one power-law function $k \times m^{-p}$, where m is the multiplicity, k is the depth-related parameter decreasing with overburden, and p is the slope parameter that remains unchanged with depth. Instead, we see the emergence of a second component. It is evident already in the muon-suppressed spectrum collected on the surface and dominates the spectra at 1166 and 4000 m.w.e. In addition, we see indications of a possible structure in the second component that resembles emissions of approximately 74, 106, 143, and 214 neutrons from the target. Since the anomaly varies only slightly with depth, it is not directly correlated with the muon flux. We propose new underground measurements employing low-cost, large-area, position-sensitive neutron counters to verify and investigate the observed anomalies and ascertain their origin.</description>

      <title>MOSAIC: Magnonic Observations of Spin-dependent Axion-like InteraCtions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an array-scalable, magnon-based detector (MOSAIC) to search for the spin-dependent interactions of electron-coupled axion dark matter. These axions can excite single magnons in magnetic targets, such as the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres used here, which are subsequently sensed by the detector. For MOSAIC, this sensing is implemented by coupling the magnons in the YIG spheres to magnetic-field-resilient single-electron charge-qubits, whose state is then interrogated with a quantum non-demolition measurement. Using standard superconducting fabrication techniques, MOSAIC can integrate many YIG sphere-qubit sensors, forming a large detector array. We outline the detector design and operation, and determine its sensitivity to axion dark matter. We find that a detector built with available technology will exceed the sensitivity of previous ferromagnetic haloscopes, and provides a platform where further improvements in performance would search for electron-coupled axion dark matter in unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Tensor hybrid mesons $\overline{b}gc$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters and widths of the tensor hybrid mesons $H_{\mathrm{ bc}}$ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{bc}}$ with the structure $\overline{b}gc$ and spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{P}}=2^{-}$ and $J^{\mathrm{P}}=2^{+}$ are calculated with high accuracy in the QCD sum rule framework. Information on their masses $m=(7.214\pm 0.075)~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\widetilde{m} =(7.685\pm 0.040)~\mathrm{GeV}$ enable us to determine decay channels of $H_{\mathrm{bc} }$ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{bc}}$. The full width of the meson $H_{ \mathrm{bc}}$ is estimated by considering the decays $H_{\mathrm{bc}} \to D^{+}\overline{B}^{\ast 0}$ and $D^{0}B^{\ast +}$. The channels $\widetilde{H }_{\mathrm{bc}}\to B^{+}D^{0}$, $B^{0}D^{+}$, $B^{\ast +}D^{\ast 0}$, $ B^{\ast 0}D^{\ast +} $, $B_{s}^{0}D_{s}^{+}$, and $B_{s}^{\ast 0}D_{s}^{\ast +}$ are studied to find the width of the $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{bc}}$ state. The widths of these processes are calculated using QCD three-point sum rule approach, which require estimation of the strong couplings at hybrid-meson-meson vertices. The results $(50.8 \pm 9.8)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $ (184.3\pm 22.8)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the full widths of the hybrid mesons $H_{ \mathrm{bc}}$ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{bc}}$ characterize them as relatively narrow and broad structures, respectively.</description>

      <title>Brazilian Report on Dark Matter 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key scientific objectives for the next decade is to uncover the nature of dark matter (DM). We should continue prioritizing targets such as weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), Axions, and other low-mass dark matter candidates to improve our chances of achieving it. A varied and ongoing portfolio of experiments spanning different scales and detection methods is essential to maximize our chances of discovering its composition. This report paper provides an updated overview of the Brazilian community's activities in dark matter and dark sector physics over the past years with a view for the future. It underscores the ongoing need for financial support for Brazilian groups actively engaged in experimental research to sustain the Brazilian involvement in the global search for dark matter particles</description>

      <title>Development of the Beam Monitor Detectors for the Low-E Beamline at the CERN SPS H2 Line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of beam tests were conducted at the KEK AR test beamline in ordet to investigate the performance of a prototype detector for instrumentation in the low-E beamline at the CERN H2 line. For the silicon strip detector, the simultaneous readout of all strips of the X-Y detector was evaluated, in addition to the detection efficiency being assessed through coincidences with the trigger scintillators. The results demonstrated the successful acquisition of data with full strip readout and the reconstruction of the two-dimensional beam profile. Furthermore, we are contemplating the incorporation of GAGG crystals, an inorganic scintillator characterized by a high light yield ($\sim$$5 \times 10^{4}$ photons/MeV) and a brief time constant ($\sim$60 ns), within the newly developed time-of-flight detector. We assessed the resolution of time-of-flight based on the data, with the objective of achieving the required performance benchmarks through future improvements to the time-of-tlight detector.</description>

      <title>A novel method for measuring the attenuation length and the group velocity of transparent liquids in a variable length cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transparency of liquid scintillators or water is an important parameter for many detectors in particle and astroparticle physics. In this work, the Cavity Enhanced Long Light Path Attenuation Length Screening (CELLPALS) method for the determination of the attenuation length is presented for the first time. The method is based on an experimental setup similar to a Fabry-P\'erot interferometer but adding up multiple-reflected intensities of a modulated light source. CELLPALS was developed to measure the attenuation length of highly transparent liquids (&gt; 10 m) with significantly lower uncertainties than with UV-Vis spectroscopy, which is a standard method for determining the attenuation length. In addition to the attenuation length, the group velocity of light in the sample can also be derived from the free spectral range of the cavity, which is not provided by any conventional method for determining the attenuation length. In this work, the CELLPALS method, its achievable precision and an experimental setup to demonstrate its feasibility are discussed. The attenuation lengths and group velocities of several transparent liquids were measured at wavelengths between 420 nm and 435 nm. In addition, the attenuation length and group velocity of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) samples after different purification stages and a purified LAB-based liquid scintillator were measured at a wavelength of 425 nm. The results confirmed the potential of CELLPALS to determine the attenuation length with an uncertainty of ~ 2 %. The group velocity of light in the sample can be determined with an uncertainty of ~ 0.03 %.</description>

      <title>A LOFAR-style reconstruction of cosmic-ray air showers with SKA-Low</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray air shower detection with the low-frequency part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope is envisioned to yield very high precision measurements of the particle composition of cosmic rays between $10^{16}$ and $10^{18}$ eV. This is made possible by the extreme antenna density of the core of SKA-Low, surpassing the current most dense radio air shower observatory LOFAR by over an order of magnitude. In order to make these measurements, the technical implementation of this observation mode and the development of reconstruction methods have to happen hand-in-hand. As a first lower limit of what is obtainable, we apply the current most precise reconstruction methods as used at LOFAR to a first complete simulation of air shower signals for the SKA-Low array. We describe this simulation setup and discuss the obtainable accuracy and resolution. A special focus is put on effects of the dynamic range of the system, beamforming methods to lower the energy threshold, as well as the limits to the mass composition accuracy given by statistical and systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of $cc\bar u\bar s$ tetraquark channel in $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}_s$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of coupled $DD_s^*$ and $D^*D_s$ scattering amplitudes in the $J^{P}=1^{+}$ channel and elastic $DD_s$ scattering amplitude in the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ channel.The aim is to investigate whether tetraquarks with flavor $cc\bar u\bar s$ exist in the region near threshold. Lattice QCD ensembles from the CLS consortium with $m_{\pi} \sim 280$ MeV, $a\sim0.09$ fm and $L/a = 24, 32$ are utilized. Finite-volume spectra are determined via variational analysis of two-point correlation matrices, computed using large bases of operators resembling bilocal two-meson structures within the distillation framework. The scattering matrix for partial wave $l=0$ is determined using lattice eigenenergies from multiple inertial frames following L\"uscher's formalism as well as following the solutions of Lippmann-Schwinger Equation in the finite-volume on a plane-wave basis. We observe small nonzero energy shifts in the simulated spectra from the noninteracting scenario in both the channels studied, which points to rather weak nontrivial interactions between the mesons involved. Despite the nonzero energy shifts, the lattice-extracted $S$-wave amplitudes do not carry signatures of any hadron pole features in the physical amplitudes in the energy region near the threshold.</description>

      <title>Search for heavy scalar or pseudoscalar states in $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ events at CMS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for scalar or pseudoscalar states decaying to a top quark-antiquark pair ($\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$), using $138\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of pp collision data taken at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ using the CMS detector, is presented. Events with one or two leptons are analyzed using the invariant $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ mass ($m_{\mathrm{t \bar{t}}}$) as well as angular and spin correlation observables. An excess in the data is observed for low values of $m_{\mathrm{t \bar{t}}}$, preferring a pseudoscalar over a scalar hypothesis. It is interpreted in terms of a generic model of (pseudo)scalar boson production, as well as a simplified model of a $\mathrm{t \bar{t}}$ bound state ($\eta_{\mathrm{t}}$), yielding good agreement with the data. Moreover, limits on the couplings of additional (pseudo)scalar bosons to top quarks are set.</description>

      <title>Simulation Tool Development and Sensitivity Analysis of 160Gd Double Beta Decay Search by the PIKACHU Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay (0v2b) has been investigated as a physical process that can provide evidence for the Majorana nature of neutrinos. The theoretical predictions of the 0v2b rate are subject to significant uncertainty, primarily due to nuclear matrix elements (NME). To reduce this uncertainty, experimental measurements of the half-lives of two-neutrino double beta decay (2v2b) in various nuclei are essential as a benchmark for NME calculations. The PIKACHU (Pure Inorganic scintillator experiment in KAmioka for CHallenging Underground sciences) project searches for the previously unobserved 2v2b decay of 160Gd, employing Ce-doped Gd3Ga3Al2O12 (GAGG) single crystals. In the Phase 1 experiment, we aim to improve the current lower limit on the 2v2b half-life of 160Gd by a prior study using a Ce-doped Gd2SiO5 (GSO) crystal. Ultimately, in Phase 2, the project seeks to achieve a sensitivity surpassing the theoretical prediction of 7.4 x 10^20 years, enabling the potential discovery of the 160Gd 2v2b decay. In this paper, we describe the development of background models based on GEANT4 simulations. The modeled backgrounds are contributions from uranium and thorium decay chains, 40K present in GAGG, and 40K gamma-rays from outside of GAGG. Additionally, we developed models for both 2v2b and 0v2b decay by implementing the theoretical kinematics of two-electron emission in double beta decay in the GEANT4 simulation. As a result, our background models successfully reproduced the measured background spectrum through fitting. By generating pseudo background spectra expected in Phase 1 and analyzing them with the combined background and 2v2b models, we evaluated the 2v2b sensitivity of Phase 1 to be 2.78 x 10^19 years (90% C.L.). This paper presents the development of these simulation models and the expected sensitivities for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 based on the pseudo data analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With no direct evidence for new physics at the TeV scale, deviations from the Standard Model (SM) can be explored systematically through Effective Field Theories (EFTs) such as the Standard Model EFT (SMEFT). SMEFT extends the SM by introducing higher-dimensional operators parametrized by Wilson coefficients, offering a framework to probe beyond the SM (BSM) effects. This contribution highlights three recent analyses using the ATLAS Run-2 dataset at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 140 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. Combined measurements improve the sensitivity to Wilson coefficients by reducing degeneracies and tightening constraints, exploring the potential of SMEFT in the top quark sector.</description>

      <title>Status of the Proton EDM Experiment (pEDM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Proton EDM Experiment (pEDM) is the first direct search for the proton electric dipole moment (EDM) with the aim of being the first experiment to probe the Standard Model (SM) prediction of any particle EDM. Phase-I of pEDM will achieve $10^{-29} e\cdot$cm, improving current indirect limits by four orders of magnitude. This will establish a new standard of precision in nucleon EDM searches and offer a unique sensitivity to better understand the Strong CP problem. The experiment is ideally positioned to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), with sensitivity to axionic dark matter via the signal of an oscillating proton EDM and across a wide mass range of BSM models from $\mathcal{O}(1\text{GeV})$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^3\text{TeV})$. Utilizing the frozen-spin technique in a highly symmetric storage ring that leverages existing infrastructure at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), pEDM builds upon the technological foundation and experimental expertise of the highly successful Muon $g$$-$$2$ Experiments. With significant R\&amp;D and prototyping already underway, pEDM is preparing a conceptual design report (CDR) to offer a cost-effective, high-impact path to discovering new sources of CP violation and advancing our understanding of fundamental physics. It will play a vital role in complementing the physics goals of the next-generation collider while simultaneously contributing to sustaining particle physics research and training early-career researchers during gaps between major collider operations.</description>

      <title>Hidden charm ${\cal P}_{cs}(4338)^0$ production in baryonic $B^-\to J/\psi \Lambda\bar p$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resonant baryonic $B$ decay $B^-\to {\cal P}_{cs}^0\bar p,{\cal P}_{cs}^0\to J/\psi \Lambda$, where ${\cal P}_{cs}^0\equiv {\cal P}_{cs}(4338)^0$ is identified as a hidden charm pentaquark candidate with strangeness. By interpreting ${\cal P}_{cs}^0$ as the $\Xi_c\bar D$ molecule that strongly decays into $J/\psi\Lambda$ and $\eta_c\Lambda$, we discover a dominant triangle rescattering effect for $B^-\to {\cal P}_{cs}^0\bar p$, initiated by $B^-\to J/\psi K^-$. Through the exchange of a $\bar \Lambda$ anti-baryon, $J/\psi$ and $K^-$ undergo rescattering, transforming into ${\cal P}_{cs}^0$ and $\bar p$, respectively. Based on this rescattering mechanism, we calculate ${\cal B}(B^-\to {\cal P}_{cs}^0\bar p,{\cal P}_{cs}^0\to J/\psi \Lambda) =(1.4^{+2.1}_{-1.1})\times10^{-6}$, which is consistent with the measured data.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant differences are around $30 \ \%$ for Ar and $80 \ \%$ for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The transition is dominated from the $3p$ shell electrons for Ar. For Xe, $5p$ states dominate the contribution, but, $4d$ states give $\sim 40\ \%$ contribution at 1 keV.</description>

      <title>Prospects for quantum process tomography at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information theory, the evolution of an open quantum system -- a unitary evolution followed by a measurement -- is described by a quantum channel or, more generally, a quantum instrument. In this work, we formulate spin and flavour measurements in collider experiments as quantum instruments. We demonstrate that the Choi matrix, which completely determines input-output transitions, can be both theoretically computed from a given model and experimentally reconstructed from a set of final state measurements (quantum state tomography) using varied input states. The experimental reconstruction of the Choi matrix, known as quantum process tomography, offers a powerful new approach for probing potential extensions of the Standard Model within the quantum field theory framework and, at the same time, constitutes a new foundational test of quantum mechanics itself. As an example, we outline the quantum process tomography approach applied to the $e^+ e^- \to t \bar{t}$ process at a polarized lepton collider.</description>

      <title>Blazar Boosted ALP and vector portal Dark matter confronting light mediator searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trouble in detecting low mass dark matter due to its low kinetic energy can be ameliorated in the boosted dark matter framework, where a sub-population of galactic dark matter attains very high energy after being up-scattered by energetic standard model particles. However, in such a scenario the upper limits on the cross-section obtained hitherto are typically large. Hence in the minimal extension of standard model where new mediators act as a portal between the dark and visible sectors, the direct detection limits for sub-GeV dark matter might lie within the exclusion region of other ground based searches of the mediator. To evade this deadlock, we allude to blazar boosted dark matter electron scattering in multi-ton neutrino detector Super kamiokande. We consider minimal models such as axion like particle (ALP) and vector portal dark matter being upscattered by high energy blazar jet and analyse the interesting parameter reaches from Super kamiokande in the parameter space of the mediator, surpassing the existing constraints. Besides, this scenario exhibits stronger limits for previously unexplored ALP mediated sub-MeV dark matter search which is difficult due to associated momentum suppression.</description>
