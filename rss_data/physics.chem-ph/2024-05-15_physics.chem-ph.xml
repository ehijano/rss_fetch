      <title>Four-component relativistic third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction theory for electron detachment, attachment, electronic excitation problem and calculation of first order transition properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) theory has been implemented to calculate ionisation potential, electron attachment and excitation energy (IP/EA/EE-ADC(3)) in a four-component relativistic framework. We have used polarisation propagator formulation for third-order perturbation theory to access the excitation energies (EE), and for IP/EA, a single-particle propagator has been used based on a non-Dyson formulation. The benchmarking calculations have been performed on various types of systems to test the accuracy of the four component ADC(3) scheme for the computation of IP, EA and EE. We have applied our IP-ADC(3) to demonstrate the computation of splitting in the IP states for halogen monoxides (XO, X = Cl, Br, I ) due to spin-orbital coupling in the 2^{\Pi} ground state and compared it with experimental results. Next, we have studied the effect of relativity and the size of the basis set on the electron attachment calculations of halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br, I and At) using EA-ADC(3). As our next step, we have shown the efficiency of four component ADC(3) in computing excitation energies of triiodide ion and compared with relativistic equation of motion coupled cluster with singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD), intermediate Hamiltonian Fock space coupled cluster (IHFS-CC) and other EOM-CCSD schemes in which spin-orbit coupling is incorporated with different degrees of approximation. Finally, we have also investigated the excitation energies and transition dipole moments for the four excited states of Xe atom and compared them with our recent four-component EOM-CCSD implementation and relativistic finite field Fock space coupled cluster results, along with the experimental estimates.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spin-Adapted Implementation of Multireference Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory. I. Core-Ionized States and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of multireference algebraic diagrammatic construction theory (MR-ADC) for simulating core-ionized states and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Taking advantage of spin adaptation, automatic code generation, and density fitting, our implementation can perform calculations for molecules with more than 1500 molecular orbitals, incorporating static and dynamic correlation in the ground and excited electronic states. We demonstrate the capabilities of MR-ADC methods by simulating the XPS spectra of substituted ferrocene complexes and azobenzene isomers. For the ground electronic states of these molecules, the XPS spectra computed using the extended second-order MR-ADC method (MR-ADC(2)-X) are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. We further show that MR-ADC can be used as a tool for interpreting or predicting the results of time-resolved XPS measurements by simulating the core ionization spectra of azobenzene along its photoisomerization, including the XPS signatures of excited states and the minimum energy conical intersection. This work is the first in a series of publications reporting the efficient implementations of MR-ADC methods.</description>

      <title>Line intensities of CO near 1560 nm measured with absorption and dispersion spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision line intensities are of great value in various applications, such as greenhouse gas metrology, planetary atmospheric analysis, and trace gas detection. Here we report simultaneous measurements of cavity-enhanced absorption and dispersion spectroscopy of the prototype molecule $^{12}$C$^{16}$O using the same optical resonant cavity. Nine lines were measured in the R branch of the $v=3-0$ band. The absorption and dispersion spectra were fitted separately with speed-dependent Voigt profiles, and the line intensities obtained by the two methods agree within the experimental uncertainty of about 1\textperthousand. The results demonstrate the feasibility of SI-traceable molecular density measurements based on laser spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Multi-center decomposition of molecular densities: A numerical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze various Iterative Stockholder Analysis (ISA) methods for molecular density partitioning, focusing on the numerical performance of the recently proposed Linear approximation of Iterative Stockholder Analysis model (LISA) [J. Chem. Phys. 156, 164107 (2022)]. We first provide a systematic derivation of various iterative solvers to find the unique LISA solution. In a subsequent systematic numerical study, we evaluate their performance on 48 organic and inorganic, neutral and charged molecules and also compare LISA to two other well-known ISA variants: the Gaussian Iterative Stockholder Analysis (GISA) and Minimum Basis Iterative Stockholder analysis (MBIS). The study reveals that LISA-family methods can offer a numerically more efficient approach with better accuracy compared to the two comparative methods. Moreover, the well-known issue with the MBIS method, where atomic charges obtained for negatively charged molecules are anomalously negative, is not observed in LISA-family methods. Despite the fact that LISA occasionally exhibits elevated entropy as a consequence of the absence of more diffuse basis functions, this issue can be readily mitigated by incorporating additional or integrating supplementary basis functions within the LISA framework. This research provides the foundation for future studies on the efficiency and chemical accuracy of molecular density partitioning schemes.</description>

      <title>Extending Non-Perturbative Simulation Techniques for Open-Quantum Systems to Excited-State Proton Transfer and Ultrafast Non-Adiabatic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited state proton transfer is an ubiquitous phenomenon in biology and chemistry, spanning from the ultrafast reactions of photo-bases and acids to light-driven, enzymatic catalysis and photosynthesis. However, the simulation of such dynamics involves multiple challenges, since high-dimensional, out-of-equilibrium vibronic states play a crucial role, while a fully quantum description of the proton's dissipative, real-space dynamics is also required. In this work, we extend the powerful Matrix Product State approach to open quantum systems (TEDOPA) to study these demanding dynamics, and also more general non-adiabatic processes that can appear in complex photochemistry subject to strong laser driving. As an illustration, we initially consider an open model of a four-level electronic system interacting with hundreds of intramolecular vibrations that drive ultrafast excited state proton transfer, as well as an explicit photonic environment that allows us to directly monitor the resulting dual fluorescence in this system. We then demonstrate how to include a continuous 'reaction coordinate' of the proton transfer that allows numerically exact simulations that can be understood, visualized and interpreted in the familiar language of diabatic and adiabatic dynamics on potential surfaces, while also retaining an exact quantum treatment of dissipation and driving effects that could be used to study diverse problems in ultrafast photochemistry.</description>

      <title>LATTE: an atomic environment descriptor based on Cartesian tensor contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new descriptor for local atomic environments, to be used in combination with machine learning models for the construction of interatomic potentials. The Local Atomic Tensors Trainable Expansion (LATTE) allows for the efficient construction of a variable number of many-body terms with learnable parameters, resulting in a descriptor that is efficient, expressive, and can be scaled to suit different accuracy and computational cost requirements. We compare this new descriptor to existing ones on several systems, showing it to be competitive with very fast potentials at one end of the spectrum, and extensible to an accuracy close to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Dynamic exchange-correlation effects in the strongly coupled electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first quasi-exact \textit{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the dynamic local field correction $\widetilde{G}(\mathbf{q},z_l;r_s,\Theta)$ in the imaginary Matsubara frequency domain, focusing on the strongly coupled finite temperature uniform electron gas. These allow us to investigate the impact of dynamic exchange--correlation effects onto the static structure factor. Our results provide a straightforward explanation for previously reported spurious effects in the so-called \textit{static approximation} [Dornheim \textit{et al.}, \textit{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{125}, 235001 (2020)], where the frequency-dependence of the local field correction is neglected. Our findings hint at the intriguing possibility of constructing an analytical four-parameter representation of $\widetilde{G}(\mathbf{q},z_l;r_s,\Theta)$ valid for a substantial part of the phase diagram, which would constitute key input for thermal density functional theory simulations.</description>

      <title>The Flux Hypothesis for Odd Transport Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Onsager's regression hypothesis makes a fundamental connection between macroscopic transport phenomena and the average relaxation of spontaneous microscopic fluctuations. This relaxation, however, is agnostic to odd transport phenomena, in which fluxes run orthogonal to the gradients driving them. To account for odd transport, we generalize the regression hypothesis, postulating that macroscopic linear constitutive laws are, on average, obeyed by microscopic fluctuations, whether they contribute to relaxation or not. From this "flux hypothesis," Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations follow, elucidating the separate roles of broken time-reversal and parity symmetries underlying various odd transport coefficients. As an application, we derive and verify the Green-Kubo relation for odd collective diffusion in chiral active matter, first in an analytically-tractable model and subsequently through molecular dynamics simulations of concentrated active spinners.</description>

      <title>Lambda-ABF: Simplified, Portable, Accurate and Cost-effective Alchemical Free Energy Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient and robust method to compute alchemical free energy differences, resulting from the application of multiple walker Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) in conjunction with strongly damped Langevin $\lambda$-dynamics. Unbiased alchemical free energy surfaces are naturally recovered by Thermodynamic Integration (TI). No manual optimization of the $\lambda$ schedule is required as the sampling of the $\lambda$ variable is continuous and converges towards a uniform distribution. Free diffusion of $\lambda$ improves orthogonal relaxation compared to fixed $\lambda$ methods such as standard TI or Free Energy Perturbation (FEP). Furthermore, the multiple walker strategy provides coverage of orthogonal space in a generic way with minimal user input and negligible computational overhead. Of practical importance, no adiabatic decoupling between the alchemical and Cartesian degrees of freedom is assumed, ensuring unbiased estimates for a wide envelope of numerical parameters. We present two high-performance implementations of the method in production molecular dynamics engines, namely NAMD and Tinker-HP, through coupling with the Colvars open source library. These interfaces enable the combination of the rich feature sets of those packages. We demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the approach on several real-world cases: from solvation free energies up to ligand-receptor binding (using a recently proposed binding restraint scheme) with both fixed-charge and polarizable models. We find that, for a chosen accuracy, the computational cost is strongly reduced compared to state-of-the-art fixed-lambda methods and that results within 1~kcal/mol of experimental value are recovered for the most complex system. The implementation is publicly available and readily usable by practitioners of current alchemical methods.</description>

      <title>Analytic Calculation of Transition dipole moment using four-component relativistic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster expectation value approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an efficient scheme for the calculation of transition properties within the four-component relativistic equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) method using the expectation value approach. The calculation of transition properties within the relativistic EOM-CC framework requires the solution of both right and left eigenvectors using Davidson's iterative diagonalization scheme. The accuracy of the approach has been investigated by calculating low-lying transitions of Xe atom, HI molecule and spin forbidden 1S0 to 3P1 and spin allowed 1S0 to 1P1 transitions in a few closed shell cations. Additionally, applications aimed at evaluating the L-edge X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS) of Ar atom is studied. The calculated results show good agreement with the earlier theoretical studies and experimental values.</description>

      <title>Calculation of electron-impact and photo-ionization cross sections of methane using analytical Gaussian integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ionization by photon or electron impact of the inner (2a1) and outer (1t2) valence orbitals of the CH4 molecule is investigated theoretically. In spite of a number of approximations, including a monocentric approach and a rather simple distorting molecular potential, the calculated cross sections are overall similar to those of other theoretical methods, and in reasonable agreement with experimental data. The originality of the present approach stands in the way we evaluate the transition matrix elements. The key ingredient of the calculation scheme is that the continuum radial wave function of the ejected electron is represented by a finite sum of complex Gaussian type orbitals. This numerically expensive optimization task is then largely compensated by rather simple and rapid analytical calculations of the necessary integrals, and thus all ionization observables, including cross section angular distributions. The proposed and implemented Gaussian approach is proved to be numerically very reliable in all considered kinematical situations with ejected electrons up to 2.7 a.u.. The analytical formulation of the scheme is provided here for bound molecular states described by monocentric Slater type orbitals; however, Gaussian type orbitals may be equally be employed. In combination with complex Gaussian functions for the continuum states, an all Gaussian approach with multicentric bound states can be envisaged.</description>

Abstract: Direct laser-coolability and a comparatively simple electronic structure render alkaline-earth metal monofluoride molecules versatile laboratories for precision tests of fundamental physics. In this theoretical work, a route for efficient stopping and cooling of high-energy hot beams of mass-selected alkaline-earth metal monofluorides via their anions is explored to facilitate subsequent precision experiments with trapped molecules. It is shown that these molecular anions possess an unusually strong chemical bond and that RaF$^-$ features properties favourable for efficient pre-cooling, indicating the applicability of direct laser-cooling of the anion.</description>

      <title>Consistent Second-Order Treatment of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Dynamic Correlation in Quasidegenerate N-Electron Valence Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formulation and implementation of second-order quasidegenerate N-electron valence perturbation theory (QDNEVPT2) that provides a balanced and accurate description of spin-orbit coupling and dynamic correlation effects in multiconfigurational electronic states. In our approach, the energies and wavefunctions of electronic states are computed by treating electron repulsion and spin-orbit coupling operators as equal perturbations to the non-relativistic complete active-space wavefunctions and their contributions are incorporated fully up to the second order. The spin-orbit effects are described using the Breit-Pauli (BP) or exact two-component Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) Hamiltonians within spin-orbit mean-field approximation. The resulting second-order methods (BP2- and DKH2-QDNEVPT2) are capable of treating spin-orbit coupling effects in nearly degenerate electronic states by diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian expanded in a compact non-relativistic basis. For a variety of atoms and small molecules across the entire periodic table, we demonstrate that DKH2-QDNEVPT2 is competitive in accuracy with variational two-component relativistic theories. BP2-QDNEVPT2 shows high accuracy for the second- and third-period elements, but its performance deteriorates for heavier atoms and molecules. We also consider the first-order spin-orbit QDNEVPT2 approximations (BP1- and DKH1-QDNEVPT2), among which DKH1-QDNEVPT2 is reliable but less accurate than DKH2-QDNEVPT2. Both DKH1- and DKH2-QDNEVPT2 hold promise as efficient and accurate electronic structure methods for treating electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling in a variety of applications.</description>

Abstract: The observation of oxygen (O)- and nitrogen (N)-bearing molecules gives an idea about the complex prebiotic chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this article, we present the identification of the rotational emission lines of N-bearing molecules ethyl cyanide (C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN), cyanoacetylene (HC$_{3}$N), and O-bearing molecules methyl formate (CH$_{3}$OCHO) towards high-mass protostar IRAS 18089$-$1732 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We also detected the emission lines of both N- and O-bearing molecule formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO) in the envelope of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We have detected the $v$ = 0 and 1 states rotational emission lines of CH$_{3}$OCHO. We also detected the two vibrationally excited states of HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1 and $v$7 = 2). The estimated fractional abundances of C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN, HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1), HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 2), and NH$_{2}$CHO towards the IRAS 18089$-$1732 are (1.40$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-10}$, (7.5$\pm$0.7)$\times$10$^{-11}$, (3.1$\pm$0.4)$\times$10$^{-11}$, and (6.25$\pm$0.82)$\times$10$^{-11}$. Similarly, the estimated fractional abundances of CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 0) and CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 1) are (1.90$\pm$0.9)$\times$10$^{-9}$ and (8.90$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{-10}$, respectively. We also created the integrated emission maps of the detected molecules, and the observed molecules may have originated from the extended envelope of the protostar. We show that C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN and HC$_{3}$N are most probably formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of the CH$_{2}$CHCN and the reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and CN on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We found that NH$_{2}$CHO is probably produced due to the reaction between NH$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$CO in the gas phase. Similarly, CH$_{3}$OCHO is possibly created via the reaction between radical CH$_{3}$O and radical HCO on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732.</description>

Abstract: Evaluating multi-center molecular integrals with Cartesian Gaussian-type basis sets has been a long-standing bottleneck in electronic structure theory calculation for solids and molecules. We have developed a vector-coupling and vector-uncoupling scheme to solve molecular Coulomb integrals with solid harmonics basis functions(SHGO). Solid harmonics are eigenstates of angular momentum, making it possible to factorize molecular integrals. By combining solid harmonic addition, differential and product rules, the computationally costly multi-center four-center integrals can be factored into an angular part and a radial component dependent on the atomic positions. The potential speed-up ratio in evaluating molecular nuclear Coulomb integrals in our method can reach up to four orders of magnitude for atomic orbitals with high angular momentum quantum numbers. The foundation underpinning the mathematical efficiency is the quantum angular momentum theory, where both vector-coupling and vector-uncoupling schemes correspond to unitary Clebsch-Gordan transformations that act on quantum angular momentum states, influencing their degree of entanglement. By incorporating quantum angular momentum through these transformations, the entanglement of the states can be reduced, and the less entanglement there is for a quantum system, the easier it is to simulate. The highly efficient method unveiled here opens new avenues for accelerated material and molecule design and discovery.</description>
