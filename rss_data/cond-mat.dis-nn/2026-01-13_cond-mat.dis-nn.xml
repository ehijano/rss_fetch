      <title>In-context learning emerges in chemical reaction networks without attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether chemical processes can perform in-context learning (ICL), a mode of computation typically associated with transformer architectures. ICL allows a system to infer task-specific rules from a sequence of examples without relying solely on fixed parameters. Traditional ICL relies on a pairwise attention mechanism which is not obviously implementable in chemical systems. However, we show theoretically and numerically that chemical processes can achieve ICL through a mechanism we call subspace projection, in which the entire input vector is mapped onto comparison subspaces, with the dominant projection determining the computational output. We illustrate this mechanism analytically in small chemical systems and show numerically that performance is robust to input encoding and dynamical choices, with the number of tunable degrees of freedom in the input encoding as a key limitation. Our results provide a blueprint for realizing ICL in chemical or other physical media and suggest new directions for designing adaptive synthetic chemical systems and understanding possible biological computation in cells.</description>

      <title>Essentially No Energy Barrier Between Independent Fermionic Neural Quantum State Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have proven highly effective in representing quantum many-body wavefunctions, but their loss landscape remains poorly understood and debated. Here, we demonstrate that the NQS loss landscape is more benign and similar to conventional deep learning than previously thought, exhibiting mode connectivity: independently trained NQS are connected by paths in parameter space with essentially no energy barrier. To construct these paths, we develop GeoNEB, a path optimizer integrating efficient stochastic reconfiguration with the nudged elastic band method for constructing minimum energy paths. For the strongly interacting six-electron quantum dot modeled by a $1.6$M-parameter Psiformer, we find two independent minima with expected energy barrier $\sim10^{-5}$ times smaller than the system's overall energy scale and $\sim10^{-3}$ times smaller than the linear path's barrier. The path respects physical symmetry in addition to achieving low energy, with the angular momentum remaining well quantized throughout. Our work is the first to construct optimized paths between independently trained NQS, and it suggests that the NQS loss landscape may not be as pathological as once feared.</description>

      <title>Spectral Topology and Delocalization in Disordered Hatano-Nelson Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unidirectional Hatano-Nelson chain serves as the fundamental non-Hermitian building block of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We investigate its Anderson localization properties under diagonal binary disorder. For weak disorder, the complex eigenvalue spectrum forms a single closed loop, which bifurcates into two distinct loops at a critical disorder threshold. Correspondingly, the spectral winding number {\nu} undergoes a transition from {\nu} = 1 in the weak-disorder regime, through {\nu} = 1/2 at the critical point, to {\nu} = 0 in the strong-disorder limit. We show that the eigenstates are exponentially localized, with a localization length that varies analytically as a function of the loop parameter. Notably, at weak and critical disorder, the spectrum hosts two completely delocalized states with diverging localization lengths. This divergence is directly correlated with the non-trivial spectral winding number. These findings remain robust under various boundary conditions, with the exception of strictly open boundaries.</description>

      <title>Learning About Learning: A Physics Path from Spin Glasses to Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hopfield model, originally inspired by spin-glass physics, occupies a central place at the intersection of statistical mechanics, neural networks, and modern artificial intelligence. Despite its conceptual simplicity and broad applicability -- from associative memory to near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems -- it is rarely integrated into standard undergraduate physics curricula. In this paper, we present the Hopfield model as a pedagogically rich framework that naturally unifies core topics from undergraduate statistical physics, dynamical systems, linear algebra, and computational methods. We provide a concise and illustrated theoretical introduction grounded in familiar physics concepts, analyze the model's energy function, dynamics, and pattern stability, and discuss practical aspects of simulation, including a freely available simulation code. To support instruction, we conclude with classroom-ready example problems designed to mirror research practice. By explicitly connecting fundamental physics to contemporary AI applications, this work aims to help prepare physics students to understand, apply, and critically engage with the computational tools increasingly central to research, industry, and society.</description>

      <title>Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivities in random site energy and associated random barrier model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07731v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal time-temperature scaling of conductivity spectra in disordered solids has been explained by thermally activated hopping of noninteracting particles over random energy barriers. An open problem is whether the random barrier model accounts for site energy disorder in real materials. Through mapping many-particle hopping in a disordered site energy landscape to that of independent particles in a barrier landscape, we show that time-temperature scaling is correctly described by the associated barrier model in the low temperature limit. However, the site energy model displays good scaling behavior at substantially higher temperatures than the barrier model, in agreement with experimental observations. Extending the mapping to different types of mobile charge carriers allows us to understand why time-temperature superposition can be absent in mixed alkali glasses.</description>

      <title>Serial vs parallel recall in the Blume-Every-Griffiths neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully connected Blume-Emery-Griffiths neural networks performing pattern recognition and associative memory have been heuristically studied in the past (mainly via the replica trick and under the replica symmetric assumption) as generalization of the standard Hopfield reference. In these notes, at first, by relying upon Guerra interpolation, we re-obtain the existing picture rigorously. Next we show that, due to dilution in the patterns, these networks are able to switch from serial recall (where one pattern is retrieved per time) to parallel recall (where several patterns are retrieved at once) and the larger the dilution, the stronger this emerging multi-tasking capability. In particular, we inspect the regimes of mild dilution (where solely a low storage of pattern can be enabled) and extreme dilution (where a medium storage of patterns can be sustained) separately as they give rise to different outcomes: the former displays hierarchical recall (distributing the amplitudes of the retrieved signals with different amplitudes), the latter -- instead -- performs a equal-strength recall (where a O(1) fraction of all the patterns is simultaneously retrieved with the same amplitude per pattern). Finally, in order to implement graded responses in the neurons, variations on theme obtained by enlarging the possible values of neural activity these neurons may sustain are also discussed generalizing the Ghatak-Sherrington model for inverse freezing in Hebbian terms.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Gauge-steerable Edge Modes In Non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper lattice exhibiting quasiperiodicity, featuring an imaginary gauge field that varies spatially but averages to zero. In the presence of open boundary conditions, this system is precisely mapped, through a nonunitary gauge transformation, to the Hermitian AAH model with balanced hopping terms. The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function. These findings offer pathways for both static and dynamic manipulation of spatially adjustable in-gap states in quasiperiodic non-Hermitian lattices.</description>

      <title>Computing quantum magic of state vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07824v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of quantum many-body states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods compute SRE and mana at cost $O(N d^{2N})$, providing an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, with substantial parallelism and straightforward GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG ( https://github.com/bsc-quantic/HadaMAG.jl/ ), which provides a high-performance toolbox for computing SRE and mana with built-in support for multithreading, MPI-based distributed parallelism, and GPU acceleration. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Potts spin glass with additional ferromagnetic interaction parametrized by $t$. It has long been observed that the Potts color symmetry breaking for the spin glass order parameter is closely related to the ferromagnetic phase transition. To clarify this, we identify a single critical value $t_\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of both color symmetry breaking and the transition to ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Universal activated aging and weak ergodicity breaking in spin and structural glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00338v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glasses possess complex energy landscapes and exhibit non-equilibrium aging dynamics. Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems.</description>

      <title>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep thermalisation -- where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles -- represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</description>

      <title>Complexity in multi-qubit and many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We apply a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order Renyi entropy. This quantity has already been used earlier termed as structural entropy and it is particularly powerful as the Renyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other Renyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.</description>

      <title>Chirality reversal at finite magnetic impurity strength and local signatures of a topological phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</description>
