      <title>Breakdown of Magic Numbers in Spherical Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic numbers in finite particle systems correspond to specific system sizes that allow configurations with low free energy, often exhibiting closed surface shells to maximize the number of nearest neighbors. Since their discovery in atomic nuclei, magic numbers have been essential for understanding the number-structure-property relationship in finite clusters across different scales. However, as system size increases, the significance of magic numbers diminishes, and the precise system size at which magic number phenomena disappear remains uncertain. In this study, we investigate colloidal clusters formed through confined self-assembly. Small magic number clusters display icosahedral symmetry with closed surface shells, corresponding to pronounced free energy minima. Our findings reveal that beyond a critical system size, closed surface shells disappear, and free energy minima become less pronounced. Instead, we observe a distinct type of colloidal cluster, termed football cluster, which retains icosahedral symmetry but features lower-coordinated facets disconnected by terraces. A sphere packing model demonstrates that forming closed surface shells becomes impossible beyond a critical system size, explaining the breakdown of magic numbers in large confined systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent dimer-model topological order and quasi-particle excitations in liquid crystals: combinatorial vortex lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystals have proven to provide a versatile experimental and theoretical platform for studying topological objects such as vortices, skyrmions, and hopfions. In parallel, in hard condensed matter physics, the concept of topological phases and topological order has been introduced in the context of spin liquids to investigate emergent phenomena like quantum Hall effects and high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we bridge these two seemingly disparate perspectives on topology in physics. Combining experiments and simulations, we show how topological defects in liquid crystals can be used as versatile building blocks to create complex, highly degenerate topological phases, which we refer to as 'Combinatorial Vortex Lattices' (CVLs). CVLs exhibit extensive residual entropy and support locally stable quasi-particle excitations in the form of charge-conserving topological monopoles, which can act as mobile information carriers and be linked via Dirac strings. CLVs can be rewritten and reconfigured on demand, endowed with various symmetries, and modified through laser-induced topological surgery - an essential capability for information storage and retrieval. We demonstrate experimentally the realization, stability, and precise optical manipulation of CVLs, thus opening new avenues for understanding and technologically exploiting higher-hierarchy topology in liquid crystals and other ordered media.</description>

      <title>Amoeboid propulsion of active solid bodies, vesicles and droplets: a comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified discussion of three types of near-spherical amoeboid microswimmers, driven by periodic, axially symmetric, achiral deformations (swim strokes): a solid deformable body, a vesicle with incompressible fluid membrane, and a droplet. Minimal models are used, which characterize the swimmer type only by boundary conditions. We calculate the swimming velocities, the dissipated power and the Lighthill efficiencies within a second order perturbation expansion in the small deformation amplitudes. %Our approach uses spherical harmonics to represent surface deformations and a system of general solutions of the Stokes equation based on vector spherical harmonics. For solid bodies, we reproduce older results by Lighthill and Blake, for vesicles and for droplets we add new results. The unified approach allows for a detailed comparison between the three types of microswimmers. We present such comparisons for swim strokes made up of spherical harmonics of adjacent orders $l$ and $l+1$, as well as for a manifold of swim strokes, made up of spherical harmonics up to order $l=4$, which respect volume- and surface-incompressibility. This manifold is two-dimensional, which allows to present swimming velocities and efficiencies in a compact graphical form. In a race in which each swimmer can choose the stroke that maximizes its speed, the droplet always comes in first, the vesicle comes in second, while the particle finishes third. However, if the three swimmers perform the same stroke, other order of rankings become possible. The maximum of the total efficiency of a droplet is greater than that of a vesicle if the internal dissipation is small. The efficiency of the solid body turns out to be typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that of vesicles and droplets. Optimizing the Lighthill efficiency and optimizing the swimming velocity result in different optimal swim strokes</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to incorporating intermolecular dispersion into the openCOSMO-RS model. Part 2: Atomic polarizabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: openCOSMO-RS is an open-source predictive thermodynamic model that can be applied to a broad range of systems in various chemical and biochemical engineering domains. This study focuses on improving openCOSMO-RS by introducing a new dispersion term based on atomic polarizabilities. We evaluate different methods for processing polarizability data, including scaling and combining it to compute segment-segment dispersion interaction energies, with a focus on halocarbon systems. The results demonstrate that the modified model outperforms our previous method developed in the first part of this work (Grigorash et al., 2024) , while at the same time requiring fewer adjustable parameters. The approach was applied to a broad dataset of over 50,000 data points, consistently increasing the accuracy across a variety of data types. These findings suggest that atomic polarizability is a valuable descriptor for refining dispersion interactions in predictive thermodynamic models.</description>

      <title>Ferri- and Ferro-Electric Switching in Spontaneously Chiral Polar Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking has demonstrated the possibility of discovering the exotic textures of ferromagnetic systems in liquid crystalline fluid ferro-electrics. We show that the polar smectic mesophase exhibited by the first molecule discovered to exhibit a spontaneously chiral ferroelectric nematic phase is also helical has a strongly varied textural morphology depending in its thermal history and phase ordering. Electro-optic studies demonstrate that the two spontaneously chiral phases exhibit field induced phase transitions. For the nematic variant, this process is threshold-less and has no hysteresis while for the smectic it has a clear threshold and shows hysteresis meaning this phase exhibits pseudo-ferrielectric switching, the first of its kind for ferroelectric nematic like phases. We show that helix formation can be both 1st and 2nd order but when it is 1st it is accompanied by pre-transitional helix formation in the preceding ferroelectric nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Stretching Response of a Polymer Chain with Deformable Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stretching response of polymer chains fundamentally determines the mechanical properties of polymer networks. In this work, we develop a statistical mechanics model that incorporates both bond stretching and bond angle deformation, enabling accurate predictions of chain behavior up to large forces. This model achieves excellent agreement with experimental data for carbon chains across all force regimes using physical parameters only. We further propose a semi-analytical deformable Freely Rotating Chain (dFRC) model, which represents the chain as a freely rotating chain with effective bond stretch and bond angle that depend on the chain stretch. We show that the dFRC model is accurate over the entire force range using the same physical parameters as the statistical model without fitting. Additionally, the dFRC model provides a direct estimate of the bond force, which is crucial to predict chain scission. By capturing key bond deformations while remaining computationally efficient, our work lays the foundation for future modeling of polymer network elasticity and failure.</description>

      <title>Automated Microsolvation for Minimum Energy Path Construction in Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing chemical reactions in solution on a molecular level is a challenging task due to the high mobility of weakly interacting solvent molecules which requires configurational sampling. For instance, polar and protic solvents can interact strongly with solutes and may interfere in reactions. However, to define and identify representative arrangements of solvent molecules modulating a transition state is a non-trivial task. Here, we propose to monitor their active participation in the decaying normal mode at a transition state, which defines active solvent molecules. Moreover, it is desirable to prepare a low-dimensional microsolvation model in a well-defined, fully automated, high-throughput, and easy-to-deploy fashion, which we propose to derive in a stepwise protocol. First, transition state structures are optimized in a sufficiently solvated quantum-classical hybrid model, which are then subjected to a re-definition of a then reduced quantum region. From the reduced model, minimally microsolvated structures are extracted that contain only active solvent molecules. Modeling the remaining solvation effects is deferred to a continuum model. To establish an easy-to-use free-energy model, we combine the standard thermochemical gas-phase model with a correction for the cavity entropy in solution. We assess our microsolvation and free-energy models for methanediol formation from formaldehyde, for the hydration of carbon dioxide (which we consider in a solvent mixture to demonstrate the versatility of our approach), and, finally, for the chlorination of phenol with hypochlorous acid.</description>

      <title>Intercellular Friction and Motility Drive Orientational Order in Cell Monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal patterns in multicellular systems are important to understanding tissue dynamics, for instance, during embryonic development and disease. Here, we use a multiphase field model to study numerically the behavior of a near-confluent monolayer of deformable cells with intercellular friction. Varying friction and cell motility drives a solid-liquid transition, and near the transition boundary, we find the emergence of local nematic order of cell deformation driven by shear-aligning cellular flows. Intercellular friction contributes to the monolayer's viscosity, which significantly increases the spatial correlation in the flow and, concomitantly, the extent of nematic order. We also show that local hexatic and nematic order are tightly coupled and propose a mechanical-geometric model for the colocalization of +1/2 nematic defects and 5-7 disclination pairs, which are the structural defects in the hexatic phase. Such topological defects coincide with regions of high cell-cell overlap, suggesting that they may mediate cellular extrusion from the monolayer, as found experimentally. Our results delineate a mechanical basis for the recent observation of nematic and hexatic order in multicellular collectives in experiments and simulations and pinpoint a generic pathway to couple topological and physical effects in these systems.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous polar and chiral symmetry breaking in ordered fluids -- heliconical ferroelectric nematic phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the chiral interaction described by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) term lead to the plethora of topological structures of magnetic spins, such as helical or skyrmion phases. Here we present the that analogues electrical DMI can lead to similar structural complexity of electric dipoles in soft matter. We report on a new polar liquid phase in which achiral molecules spontaneously form a heliconical structure. The helical pitch is comparable to the wavelength of visible light and unwinds critically at the transition to a uniformly polar, ferroelectric nematic phase. Although this new liquid crystalline phase resembles the twist-bend nematic phase, the mechanism of its formation is different and is attributed to electrical interactions that cause non-collinear arrangement of electric dipoles, similarly as observed for spins in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of inflating balloons and interacting hysterons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many materials exhibit a complex, hysteretic response to external driving, there has been a surge of interest in how the complex dynamics of internal materials states can be understood and designed to process and store information. We consider a system of connected rubber balloons that can be described by a Preisach model of non-interacting hysterons under pressure control, but for which the hysterons become coupled under volume control. We study this system by exploring the possible transition graphs, as well as by introducing a configuration space approach which tracks the volumes of each balloon. Changes in the transition graphs turn out to be related to changes in the topology of the configuration space of the balloons, providing a particularly geometric view of how transition graphs can be designed, as well as additional information on the existence of hidden metastable states. This class of systems is more general than just balloons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective chasing dynamics of non-reciprocally coupled densities leads to stable travelling waves which can be mapped to a model for emergent flocking. In this work, we couple the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model (NRCH) to a fluid to minimally describe scalar active mixtures in a suspension, with the aim to explore the stability of the waves, i.e. the emergent flock in the presence of self-generated fluid flows. We show that the emergent polarity is linearly unstable to perturbations for a specific sign of the active stress recalling instabilities of orientational order in a fluid. Using numerical simulations, we find however that non-reciprocity stabilizes the waves against the linear instability in a large region of the phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions quantitatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Relevant systems include polyelectrolyte double layers, Nafion exclusion zone, endothelial surface layer of cells, microemulsion interfaces and hexagonal phases, salt fingers in Gibbs Marangoni effects, myosin fibres in muscle, multiple nanotubes in the interior of neuronal axons, and carbon fibre materials.</description>
