      <title>Solar Wind Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun continuously expels a fraction of its own mass in the form of a steadily accelerating outflow of ionized gas called the "solar wind." The solar wind is the extension of the Sun's hot (million-degree Kelvin) outer atmosphere that is visible during solar eclipses as the bright and wispy corona. In 1958, Eugene Parker theorized that a hot corona could not exist for very long without beginning to accelerate some of its gas into interplanetary space. After more than half a century, Parker's idea of a gas-pressure-driven solar wind still is largely accepted, although many questions remain unanswered. Specifically, the physical processes that heat the corona have not yet been identified conclusively, and the importance of additional wind acceleration mechanisms continue to be investigated. Variability in the solar wind also gives rise to a number of practical "space weather" effects on human life and technology, and there is still a need for more accurate forecasting. Fortunately, recent improvements in both observations (with telescopes and via direct sampling by space probes) and theory (with the help of ever more sophisticated computers) are leading to new generations of predictive and self-consistent simulations. Attempts to model the origin of the solar wind are also leading to new insights into long-standing mysteries about turbulent flows, magnetic reconnection, and kinetic wave-particle resonances.</description>

      <title>The variable stars in the compact halo globular cluster NGC 5634 visited again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new time-series CCD \emph{VR} photometry of the globular cluster NGC 5634. We aim to use the known RR Lyrae stars, members of the cluster, as indicators of mean metallicity and distance. Accurate coordinates, periods and an identification chart of the variables in the field of our images are provided. A membership analysis was performed, based on $Gaia$-DR3 proper motions, for 3525 point sources within 15 arcmin from the cluster center. The membership status for each known variable was established and it was found that V10, V11 and V16 are most likely field stars. The variability of the RRab star V7, considered non-variable for a number of years, is demonstrated. Via the Fourier decomposition of the light curves of cluster member RR Lyrae, the mean metallicity and distance were calculated independently from RRab and RRc stars to find [Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}= -1.67 \pm 0.11$ y $D=23.9 \pm 0.8$ kpc, and [Fe/H]$_{\rm ZW}= -1.69 \pm 0.22$ y $D=22.9 \pm 1.0$ kpc respectively.</description>

      <title>First detection of acoustic-like flux in the middle solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waves are thought to play a significant role in the heating of the solar atmosphere and the acceleration of the wind. Among the many types of waves observed in the Sun, the so-called p-modes with a 3 mHz frequency peak dominate the lower atmosphere. In the presence of magnetic fields, these waves can be converted into magnetohydrodynamic modes, which then leak into the corona through magnetic conduits. High-resolution off-limb observations have indeed revealed signatures of ubiquitous and global 3 mHz oscillations in the corona, although limited to low heights and to incompressible modes. We present high-cadence, high-resolution observations of the corona in the range 1.7 - 3.6 solar radii taken in broad-band 580-640 nm visible light by the Metis coronagraph aboard Solar Orbiter. These observations were designed to investigate density fluctuations in the middle corona. The data were acquired over several days in March 2022, October 2022, and for two days in April 2023. We selected representative regions of the corona on three sample dates. Analysis of the data in those regions revealed the presence of periodic density fluctuations. By examining several time-distance diagrams, we determined the main properties (apparent propagation speed, amplitude) of those fluctuations. We also show power spectra in selected locations in order to determine the dominant frequencies. We found wave-like, compressible fluctuations of low amplitude - of the order of 0.1 % of the background - in several large-scale regions in the corona at least up to 2.5 solar radii. We also found that the apparent propagation speeds of these perturbations typically fall in the range 150 - 450 km/s. A power spectrum analysis of time series revealed an excess power in the range 2-7 mHz, often with peaks at 3 or 5 mHz, i.e. in a range consistent with p-mode frequencies of the lower solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Period Changes for 25 X-ray Binaries and the Measurement of an Empirical Universal Law for Angular Momentum Loss in Accreting Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I measure and collect timings of phase markers (like eclipse times) for the orbits of 25 X-ray binaries (XRBs) so as to calculate the steady evolutionary period change ($\dot{P}$). I combine these with my observed $\dot{P}$ measures from 52 cataclysmic variables (CVs). Further, I subtract out the contributions from gravitational radiation ($\dot{P}_{\rm GR}$) and mass transfer ($\dot{P}_{\rm mt}$), deriving the period change from the residual unknown angular momentum loss ($\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$=$\dot{P}$-$\dot{P}_{\rm GR}$-$\dot{P}_{\rm mt}$). I have $\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$ measures for 77 XRBs and CVs, with these being direct measures of the driver of binary evolution. The venerable Magnetic Braking Model (MBM) of binary evolution has its most fundamental predictions tested, with most systems having predictions wrong by over one order-of-magnitude. Other proposed mechanisms to explain the AML also fail, so we are left with no known mechanism that dominates the AML. An alternative path to the AML law is empirical, where my $\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$ measures are fitted to a power-law involving the fundamental binary properties. With this, the dominant AML law for systems with orbital periods ($P$) from 0.13--1.0 days is $\dot{P}_{\rm AML} = -1500\times10^{-12} P^{1.29} M_{\rm prim}^{2.75} M_{\rm comp}^{-1.00}\dot{M}^{0.43}_{-8}$, in appropriate units. Similar AML laws for binaries below the Period Gap and for binaries with $P$$&gt;$1.0 day are derived. These three AML laws are of good accuracy and are the best representations of the actual evolution for all 77 XRBs and CVs of all classes, so the three taken together can be called `universal'.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- VI. The Lowest-Mass Objects in M 4 and the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present `James Webb Space Telescope' observations of M4 -- the closest globular cluster -- that probe the lower Main Sequence down to the hydrogen-burning limit. The unveiled stellar sequence reaches much fainter luminosities than previously possible, revealing a few extremely red objects that are consistent with brown dwarfs as cool as T_eff~1000K. However, the lack of a second JWST epoch presently prevents us from verifying the cluster membership of these objects. By cross-matching our data with archival `Hubble Space Telescope' images, we are able to verify cluster membership for a subset of objects down to T_eff~3000K. The observed color distribution indicate that the lower Main Sequence of M4 is likely deficient in oxygen compared to its higher-mass post-Main Sequence members by ~0.5dex. This feature has now been observed in three different globular clusters (M4, NGC6397 and 47Tuc), suggesting a general trend. Finally, we derive the mass function of the Galactic bulge in the background of M4. The mass function was found to have the bottom-heavy slope of alpha=0.88+/-0.36 and appears to terminate at ~0.15 M_Sun, although the latter value may be overestimated due to the limited sample size.</description>

      <title>VLT/ERIS observations of the V960 Mon system: a dust-embedded substellar object formed by gravitational instability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V960~Mon is an FU Orionis object that shows strong evidence of a gravitationally unstable spiral arm that is fragmenting into several dust clumps. We report the discovery of a new substellar companion candidate around this young star, identified in high-contrast $L'$-band imaging with VLT/ERIS. The object is detected at a projected separation of $0.898 \pm 0.01$ arcseconds with a contrast of $(8.39 \pm 0.07) \times 10^{-3}$. The candidate lies close to the clumps previously detected in the sub-mm (at 1.3 mm) and is co-located with extended polarized IR signal from scattered stellar irradiation, suggesting it is deeply embedded. The object is undetected in the SPHERE $H$-band total intensity, placing an upper mass limit of $\sim38~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the contrast curve. Using evolutionary models at an assumed age of 1~Myr, we estimate a mass of $\sim660~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the L' brightness; however, this value likely includes a significant contribution from a disk around the companion. The discrepancy between near- and mid-infrared results again suggests the source is deeply embedded in dust. This candidate may represent an actively accreting, disk-bearing substellar object in a young, gravitationally unstable environment.</description>

      <title>Modeling HMI observables for the study of solar oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Helioseismology aims to infer the properties of the solar interior by analyzing observations of acoustic oscillations. The interpretation of the helioseismic data is however complicated by the non-trivial relationship between helioseismic observables and the physical perturbations associated with acoustic modes, as well as by various instrumental effects. Aims: We aim to improve our understanding of the signature of acoustic modes measured in the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) continuum intensity and Doppler velocity observables by accounting for radiative transfer, solar background rotation, and spacecraft velocity. Methods: We start with a background model atmosphere that accurately reproduces solar limb darkening and the Fe I 6173{\AA} spectral line profile. We employ first-order perturbation theory to model the effect of acoustic oscillations on inferred intensity and velocity. By solving the radiative transfer equation in the atmosphere, we synthesize the spectral line, convolve it with the six HMI spectral windows, and deduce continuum intensity (hmi.Ic_45s) and Doppler velocity (hmi.V_45s) according to the HMI algorithm. Results: We analytically derive the relationship between mode displacement in the atmosphere and the HMI observables, and show that both intensity and velocity deviate significantly from simple approximations. Specifically, the continuum intensity does not simply reflect the true continuum value, while the line-of-sight velocity does not correspond to a straightforward projection of the velocity at a fixed height in the atmosphere. Our results indicate that these deviations are substantial, with amplitudes of approximately 10% and phase shifts of around 10 degrees across the detector for both observables. Moreover, these effects are highly dependent on the acoustic mode under consideration and the position on the solar disk.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en wave propagation, reflection and trapping in the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves are known to be important carriers of magnetic energy that could play a role in coronal heating and/or solar wind acceleration. As these waves are efficient energy carriers, how they are dissipated still remains one of the key challenges. Using a series of 1.5-D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we explore wave energy trapping associated with field-aligned density enhancements. We examine the parameters which govern the wave reflection and trapping. The goal of our simulations is to find optimal conditions for wave trapping, which would ultimately promote the energisation of the solar atmosphere. In agreement with previous studies, we find that maximum wave reflections happen only for a narrow range of density enhancement widths, namely when it is comparable to the Alfv\'en wave wavelength. In our paper, we explain this scale-selectivity using a semi-analytical model that demonstrates the importance of wave interference effects. As expected, we find that spatially extended regions of density inhomogeneities favour enhanced wave reflection and trapping. However, wave interference causes saturation of the reflected energy for very extended regions of varying density.</description>

      <title>A half-ring of ionized circumstellar material trapped in the magnetosphere of a white dwarf merger remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many white dwarfs are observed in compact double white dwarf binaries and, through the emission of gravitational waves, a large fraction are destined to merge. The merger remnants that do not explode in a Type Ia supernova are expected to initially be rapidly rotating and highly magnetized. We here present our discovery of the variable white dwarf ZTF J200832.79+444939.67, hereafter ZTF J2008+4449, as a likely merger remnant showing signs of circumstellar material without a stellar or substellar companion. The nature of ZTF J2008+4449 as a merger remnant is supported by its physical properties: hot ($35,500\pm300$ K) and massive ($1.12\pm0.03$ M$_\odot$), the white dwarf is rapidly rotating with a period of $\approx$ 6.6 minutes and likely possesses exceptionally strong magnetic fields ($\sim$ 400-600 MG) at its surface. Remarkably, we detect a significant period derivative of $(1.80\pm0.09)\times10^{-12}$ s/s, indicating that the white dwarf is spinning down, and a soft X-ray emission that is inconsistent with photospheric emission. As the presence of a mass-transferring stellar or brown dwarf companion is excluded by infrared photometry, the detected spin down and X-ray emission could be tell-tale signs of a magnetically driven wind or of interaction with circumstellar material, possibly originating from the fallback of gravitationally bound merger ejecta or from the tidal disruption of a planetary object. We also detect Balmer emission, which requires the presence of ionized hydrogen in the vicinity of the white dwarf, showing Doppler shifts as high as $\approx$ 2000 km s$^{-1}$. The unusual variability of the Balmer emission on the spin period of the white dwarf is consistent with the trapping of a half ring of ionised gas in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf.</description>

      <title>The DBL Survey II: towards a mass-period distribution of double white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double white dwarf binaries are an important remnant of binary evolution as they are possible type Ia supernova progenitors and strong sources of gravitational waves in the low-frequency regime. The double-lined double white dwarf (DBL) survey searches for compact double white dwarfs where both stars are spectrally disentangleable. Candidates are identified by being overluminous compared to the cooling sequence of a typical mass, single white dwarf. In this second DBL survey instalment, we present full orbital solutions of 15 double white dwarf binaries from our ongoing campaign to accurately measure a magnitude-limited mass-period distribution. 12 of these systems are fully solved for the first time. A long-standing bias in the full population has been evident, favouring systems with orbital periods up to a few hours, with little exploration of the majority of the compact double white dwarf population, whose orbital period distribution centres at approximately 20hr. The 15 systems in this study span the orbital period range 5-75hr, significantly augmenting the number of well-characterised systems over these periods, and in general have two similar mass stars combining to approximately 1.0 solar masses. We witness that the orbitally derived mass ratios generally show an excellent agreement with those deduced from atmospheric fits to double-lined spectra in previous work, emphasising the power of wide-scale spectroscopic surveys to efficiently locate the highest mass, double-lined double white dwarfs in the local Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: Massive young clusters with rich populations of high-mass stars are ideal laboratories to explore their evolutionary paths. Despite being the most prominent cluster in the Perseus-arm Cas OB8 association, NGC 663 remains comparatively little studied. We present a comprehensive investigation of its properties, integrating astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data for the cluster and its surroundings, including accurate spectral classification for over 150 members. Gaia astrometry indicates over 300 B-type members, possibly rendering NGC 663 the most massive cluster in the Perseus arm, with initial mass likely exceeding 10000 M_\sun . This large population makes NGC 663 an excellent laboratory for studying massive star evolution. Spectral analysis of the earliest members reveals approximately solar metallicity and a turn-off mass of approximate 8.5 M_\sun, consistent with the photometric age of 23 Ma. We identify five spectroscopic blue stragglers, including the Be/X-ray binary RX J0146.9$+$6121. We outline its evolutionary history and compare its properties with other Be stars. Although the cluster contains many Be stars, their relative fraction is not particularly high. Intriguingly, four of the six blue supergiant members appear to have significantly higher masses than the brightest giants near the Hertzsprung gap. These observations suggest that most mid-B supergiants may form via mergers, unless stars of 10-12 M_\sun born as primaries in binaries rarely undergo supernova explosions. Similarly, if Be stars form through the binary channel, then either most are produced through case A evolution or supernovae are uncommon among primaries in this mass range.</description>

      <title>The Extended Atlas of Low-resolution Spectra from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated atlas of spectra from the Low-Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) on the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), which took spectra from 7.67 to 22.73 um with a spectral resolving power (lambda / Delta lambda) of 20-60. The updated atlas includes 11,238 spectra, including 5425 spectra published in the original LRS Atlas, 5796 spectra published in three later papers, and 17 spectra previously available online but not published. The updated atlas has significantly more sources close to the Galactic plane than the original atlas. We have applied an improved spectral correction to remove an artifact at 8 um in the original database. While the IRAS mission flew over 40 yr ago, the extended LRS atlas remains the single most complete database of mid-infrared spectra of nearby and bright objects in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Feedback-Regulated Star Formation Activities around the Expanding Galactic MIR Bubble [HKS2019] E71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the physical environment of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble [HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multi-wavelength approach. E71 is located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images (250-500 $\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the velocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc, distance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR images and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust condensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of 12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO) located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the center of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the velocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the "collect and collapse" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of LOFAR Radio-emitting M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) have revealed 19 nearby M dwarfs showing bright circularly polarised radio emission. One of the possible sources of such emission is through magnetic star-planet interactions (MSPI) with unseen close-in planets. We present initial results from a spectroscopic survey with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID spectrographs designed to characterize this sample and further investigate the origin of the radio emission. We provide four new insights into the sample. I) We uniformly characterize the stellar properties, constraining their effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities, rotation periods, stellar radii, and stellar inclinations where possible. Further, from a homogenous analysis of the HPF spectra, we infer their chromospheric activity and spectroscopic multiplicity states. From this, we identify GJ 625, GJ 1151, and LHS 2395 as single, quiescent stars amenable to precise RV follow-up, making them strong MSPI candidates. II) We show that the distribution of stellar inclinations are compatible with an isotropic distribution, providing no evidence for a preference to pole-on configurations. III) We refine the radial velocity solution for GJ 625 b, the only currently known close-in planet in the sample, reducing the uncertainty in its orbital period by a factor of three, to facilitate future phase-dependent radio analysis. IV) Finally, we identify GJ 3861 as a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of $P=14.841181_{-0.00010}^{+0.00011}$ d, making it the only confirmed binary with a relatively short orbit in the sample, where we surmise the radio emission is likely related to magnetospheric interactions between the two stars. These results advance our understanding of radio-emitting M dwarfs and establish an observational foundation for identifying MSPI.</description>

      <title>Inflated hot Jupiters: inferring average atmospheric velocity via Ohmic models coupled with internal dynamo evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inflated radii observed in hundreds of hot Jupiters (HJ) represent a long-standing open issue. In this study, we quantitatively investigate this phenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic induction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for explaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant planets with {\tt MESA}, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium temperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that extends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind intensities, averaged in the region $p\lesssim 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1 km/s in order to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly linearly with planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium temperature. This is consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from the induced field, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via conductivity, and for larger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to the evolution of the dynamo field and the proportionality of the induced currents on it, the Ohmic efficiency typically decreases by at least one order of magnitude from 0.1 to 10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a constant-in-time value. Notably, the extent of the main convective region, and the associated heat flux supporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of strong Ohmic dissipation, which in turn depends on the dynamo field strength, generating a non-trivial coupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction, potentially leading to an oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These findings remain generally valid even when accounting for a long-term increase in the main-sequence host star luminosity, although this case can more readily lead to HJ re-inflation, consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>A long-lasting eruption heralds SN 2023ldh, a clone of SN 2009ip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the results of the spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the type IIn supernova (SN) 2023ldh. Survey archive data show that the SN progenitor experienced some erratic outbursts in the years before exploding. From May 2023, the source shows a general slow luminosity rise lasting over four months with some superposed luminosity fluctuations. In analogy to SN 2009ip, we label this brightening as Event A. During Event A, SN 2023ldh reaches a maximum absolute magnitude of Mr = -15.52 +- 0.24 mag. Then the light curves show a luminosity decline of about 1 mag in all filters lasting about two weeks, followed by a steep brightening (Event B) to an absolute peak magnitude of Mr = -18.53 +- 0.23 mag, replicating the evolution of SN 2009ip and similar SNe IIn. Three spectra of SN 2023ldh are obtained during Event A, showing multi-component P Cygni profiles of H I and Fe II lines. During the rise to the Event B peak, the spectrum shows a blue continuum dominated by Balmer lines in emission with Lorentzian profiles, with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) velocity of about 650 km/s. Later, in the post-peak phase, the spectrum reddens, and broader wings appear in the Halpha line profile. Metal lines are well visible with P Cygni profiles and velocities of about 2000 km/s. Beginning around three months past maximum and until very late phases, the Ca II lines become among the most prominent features, while Halpha is dominated by an intermediate-width component with a boxy profile. Although SN 2023ldh mimics the evolution of other SN 2009ip-like transients, it is slightly more luminous and has a slower photometric evolution. The surprisingly homogeneous observational properties of SN 2009ip-like events may indicate similar explosion scenarios and similar progenitor parameters.</description>

      <title>LightCurve MoE: A Dynamic Sparse Routing Mixture-of-Experts Architecture for Efficient Stellar Light Curve Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classification of stellar light curves has become a key task in modern time-domain astronomy, fueled by the rapid growth of data from large-scale surveys such as Kepler and TESS. Although deep learning models have achieved high accuracy in this area, their computational costs can limit scalability. To tackle this issue, we propose LightCurve MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that combines dynamic sparse routing with a dual-gating mechanism to balance accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Our model includes five specialized experts, each using a different feature extraction method-such as wavelet transforms, Gramian angular fields, and recurrence plots-to capture unique patterns in the light curves. A dual-gating mechanism evaluates these expert outputs by analyzing both frequency and time-domain features, allowing the model to adaptively weigh each expert's contribution. During inference, only the top 3 out of 5 experts are activated per sample using a Top-k routing strategy, reducing computational cost by 40% compared to dense models while preserving strong accuracy (96%). The model also includes entropy regularization and a technique to retain inactive experts during training, ensuring stable and effective learning. By combining sparse computation with multi-modal feature fusion, LightCurve MoE offers a scalable solution for future large-scale photometric surveys like LSST and Global Open Transient Telescope Array (GOTTA), where processing efficiency is crucial due to the massive volume of daily data.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from the Sun can discover dark matter-electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We probe dark matter-electron scattering using high-energy neutrino observations from the Sun. Dark matter (DM) interacting with electrons can get captured inside the Sun. These captured DM may annihilate to produce different Standard Model (SM) particles. Neutrinos produced from these SM states can be observed in IceCube and DeepCore. Although there is no excess of neutrinos in the solar direction, we find that the current datasets of IceCube and DeepCore set the strongest constraint on the DM-electron scattering cross section in the DM mass range $10$\,GeV to $10^5$\,GeV. Therefore our work implies that future observations of the Sun by neutrino telescopes have the potential to discover the DM-electron interaction.</description>

      <title>An outer-disk SX Phe variable star in Rubin Data Preview 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an SX Phoenicis-type pulsating variable star via 217 epochs of time-series photometry from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1. The star, designated LSST-DP1-O- 614435753623041404 (or LSST-C25_var1 for short), has mean magnitudes of $(\langle g\rangle, \langle r\rangle) = (18.65, 18.63)$, with pulsation amplitudes of (0.60, 0.38)~mag in these bands. Its period is 0.0767 days (1.841 hours), typical of SX Phe pulsators. We derive a distance to the star of 16.6 kpc based on an SX Phe period-luminosity relation. Its position $\sim5$ kpc from the Galactic plane, in the outer Milky Way disk at a Galactocentric distance of $\sim22$ kpc, and its proper motion suggest that LSST-C25_var1 is part of the Monoceros Ring structure. This star is presented as a small taste of the many thousands of variable stars expected in Rubin/LSST data.</description>
