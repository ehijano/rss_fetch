      <title>Ecosystem Evolution and Drivers across the Tibetan Plateau and Surrounding Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tibetan Plateau (TP) and surrounding regions, vital to global energy and water cycles, are profoundly influenced by climate change and anthropogenic activities. Despite widespread attention to vegetation greening across the region since the 1980s, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study employs the eigen microstates method to quantify vegetation greening dynamics using long-term remote sensing and reanalysis data. We identify two dominant modes that collectively explain more than 61% of the vegetation dynamics. The strong seasonal heterogeneity in the southern TP, primarily driven by radiation and agricultural activities, is reflected in the first mode, which accounts for 46.34% of the variance. The second mode, which explains 15% of the variance, is closely linked to deep soil moisture (SM3, 28 cm to 1 m). Compared to precipitation and surface soil moisture (SM1 and SM2, 0 to 28 cm), our results show that deep soil moisture exerts a stronger and more immediate influence on vegetation growth, with a one-month response time. This study provides a complexity theory-based framework to quantify vegetation dynamics and underscores the critical influence of deep soil moisture on greening patterns in the TP.</description>

      <title>WOMBAT v2.S: A Bayesian inversion framework for attributing global CO$_2$ flux components from multiprocess data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contributions from photosynthesis and other natural components of the carbon cycle present the largest uncertainties in our understanding of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) sources and sinks. While the global spatiotemporal distribution of the net flux (the sum of all contributions) can be inferred from atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations through flux inversion, attributing the net flux to its individual components remains challenging. The advent of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) satellite observations provides an opportunity to isolate natural components by anchoring gross primary productivity (GPP), the photosynthetic component of the net flux. Here, we introduce a novel statistical flux-inversion framework that simultaneously assimilates observations of SIF and CO$_2$ concentration, extending WOMBAT v2.0 (WOllongong Methodology for Bayesian Assimilation of Trace-gases, version 2.0) with a hierarchical model of spatiotemporal dependence between GPP and SIF processes. We call the new framework WOMBAT v2.S, and we apply it to SIF and CO$_2$ data from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite and other instruments to estimate natural fluxes over the globe during a recent six-year period. In a simulation experiment that matches OCO-2's retrieval characteristics, the inclusion of SIF improves accuracy and uncertainty quantification of component flux estimates. Comparing estimates from WOMBAT v2.S, v2.0, and the independent FLUXCOM initiative, we observe that linking GPP to SIF has little effect on net flux, as expected, but leads to spatial redistribution and more realistic seasonal structure in natural flux components.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Framework and Optimal Projection of Weather Fields for Prediction of Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme events are the major weather-related hazard for humanity. It is then of crucial importance to have a good understanding of their statistics and to be able to forecast them. However, lack of sufficient data makes their study particularly challenging. In this work, we provide a simple framework for studying extreme events that tackles the lack of data issue by using the entire available dataset, rather than focusing on the extremes of the dataset. To do so, we make the assumption that the set of predictors and the observable used to define the extreme event follow a jointly Gaussian distribution. This naturally gives the notion of an optimal projection of the predictors for forecasting the event. We take as a case study extreme heatwaves over France, and we test our method on an 8000-year-long intermediate complexity climate model time series and on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. For a-posteriori statistics, we observe and motivate the fact that composite maps of very extreme events look similar to less extreme ones. For prediction, we show that our method is competitive with off-the-shelf neural networks on the long dataset and outperforms them on reanalysis. The optimal projection pattern, which makes our forecast intrinsically interpretable, highlights the importance of soil moisture deficit and quasi-stationary Rossby waves as precursors to extreme heatwaves.</description>

      <title>Forecast error growth: A dynamic-stochastic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a history of simple forecast error growth models designed to capture the key properties of error growth in operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. We propose here such a scalar model that relies on the previous ones and incorporates multiplicative noise in a nonlinear stochastic differential equation (SDE). We analyze the properties of this SDE, including the shape of the error growth curve for small times and its stationary distribution, and prove well-posedness and positivity of solutions. Next, we fit this model to operational NWP error growth curves, and show good agreement with both the mean and probabilistic features of the error growth. These results suggest that the dynamic-stochastic error growth model proposed herein and similar ones could play a role in many other areas of the sciences that involve prediction.</description>
