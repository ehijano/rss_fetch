      <title>New matrices for spectral hypergraph theory, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of a hypergraph explored through the spectrum of its unified matrix was made by the authors in [26]. In this paper, we introduce three different hypergraph matrices: unified Laplacian matrix, unified signless Laplacian matrix, and unified normalized Laplacian matrix, all defined using the unified matrix. We show that these three matrices of a hypergraph are respectively identical to the Laplacian matrix, signless Laplacian matrix, and normalized Laplacian matrix of the associated graph. This allows us to use the spectra of these hypergraph matrices as a means to connect the structural properties of the hypergraph with those of the associated graph. Additionally, we introduce certain hypergraph structures and invariants during this process, and relate them to the eigenvalues of these three matrices.</description>

      <title>Conic programming to understand sums of squares of eigenvalues of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a conjecture by Wocjan, Elphick and Anekstein (2018) which upper bounds the sum of the squares of the positive (or negative) eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of a graph by an expression that behaves monotonically in terms of the vector chromatic number. One of our lemmas is a strengthening of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for Hermitian matrices when one of the matrices is positive semidefinite.
  A related conjecture due to Bollob\'as and Nikiforov (2007) replaces the vector chromatic number by the clique number and sums over the first two eigenvalues only. We prove a version of this conjecture with weaker constants. An important consequence of our work is a proof that for any fixed $r$, computing a rank $r$ optimum solution to the vector chromatic number semidefinite programming is NP-hard.
  We also present a vertex weighted version of some of our results, and we show how it leads quite naturally to the known vertex-weighted version of the Motzkin-Straus quadratic optimization formulation for the clique number.</description>

      <title>Vertex orders in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit interval and interval complexes are higher-dimensional generalizations of unit interval and interval graphs, respectively. We show that strongly connected unit interval complexes are shellable with shellings induced by their unit interval orders. We also show that these complexes are vertex decomposable and hence shelling completable. On the other hand, we give simple examples of strongly connected interval complexes that are not shellable in dimensions two and higher.</description>

      <title>On the Nature and Complexity of an Impartial Two-Player Variant of the Game Lights-Out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a variant of the solitaire game Lights-Out, where the player's goal is to turn off a grid of lights. This variant is a two-player impartial game where the goal is to make the final valid move. This version is playable on any simple graph where each node is given an assignment of either a 0 (representing a light that is off) or 1 (representing a light that is on). We focus on finding the Nimbers of this game on grid graphs and generalized Petersen graphs. We utilize a recursive algorithm to compute the Nimbers for 2 x n grid graphs and for some generalized Petersen graphs.</description>

      <title>Stabilities of Kleitman diameter theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of subsets of $[n]$. The diameter of $\mathcal{F}$ is the maximum size of symmetric differences among pairs of its members. Solving a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, in 1966, Kleitman determined the maximum size of a family with fixed diameter, which states that a family with diameter $s$ has cardinality at most that of a Hamming ball of radius $s/2$. More precisely, suppose that $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is a family with diameter $s$, if $s=2d$ for an integer $d\ge 1$, then $|\mathcal{F}|\le \sum_{i=0}^d {n \choose i}$; if $s=2d+1$ for an integer $d\ge 1$, then $|\mathcal{F}|\le \sum_{i=0}^d {n \choose i} + {n-1 \choose d}$. This result extends the well-known Katona intersection theorem and the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem, and it is now known as the Kleitman diameter theorem. In 2017, Frankl characterized the extremal families of Kleitman's theorem and presented a stability result. In this paper, we solve a recent problem due to Li and Wu by determining the extremal families of Frankl's theorem, and establishing a further stability result. These theorems can be viewed as the first and second stability results for the Kleitman diameter theorem. Combining our framework with some appropriate structural analysis, it is feasible to further extend our method to establish higher-layer stability results of the Kleitman diameter theorem.</description>

      <title>Expected degrees in random plane graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, for every set of $n$ points $\mathcal{P}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, a random plane graph drawn on $\mathcal{P}$ is expected to contain less than $n/10.18$ isolated vertices. In the other direction, we construct a point set where the expected number of isolated vertices in a random plane graph is about $n/23.32$. For $i\ge 1$, we prove that the expected number of vertices of degree $i$ is always less than $n/\sqrt{\pi i}$
  Our analysis is based on cross-graph charging schemes. That is, we move charge between vertices from different plane graphs of the same point set. This leads to information about the expected behavior of a random plane graph.</description>

      <title>Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'{a}n problem of the gem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be $F$-free if it does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'{a}n problem seeks to determine the maximum spectral radius of an $F$-free graph with given size. The gem consists of a path on $4$ vertices, along with an additional vertex that is adjacent to every vertex of the path. Concerning Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'{a}n problem of the gem, when the size is odd, Zhang and Wang [Discrete Math. 347 (2024) 114171] and Yu, Li and Peng [arXiv:2404. 03423] solved it. In this paper, we completely solve the Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'{a}n problem type problem of the gem.</description>

      <title>Alphabet-affine 2-neighbour-transitive codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A code ${\mathcal C}$ is a subset of the vertex set of a Hamming graph $H(n,q)$, and ${\mathcal C}$ is $2$-neighbour-transitive if the automorphism group $G={\rm Aut}({\mathcal C})$ acts transitively on each of the sets ${\mathcal C}$, ${\mathcal C}_1$ and ${\mathcal C}_2$, where ${\mathcal C}_1$ and ${\mathcal C}_2$ are the (non-empty) sets of vertices that are distances $1$ and $2$, respectively, (but no closer) to some element of ${\mathcal C}$.
  Suppose that ${\mathcal C}$ is a $2$-neighbour-transitive code with minimum distance at least $5$. For $q=2$, all `minimal' such ${\mathcal C}$ have been classified. Moreover, it has previously been shown that a subgroup of the automorphism group of the code induces an affine $2$-transitive group action on the alphabet of the Hamming graph. The main results of this paper are to show that this affine $2$-transitive group must be a subgroup of ${\rm A}\Gamma{\rm L}_1(q)$ and to provide a number of infinite families of examples of such codes. These examples are described via polynomial algebras related to representations of certain classical groups.</description>

      <title>Equitable list coloring of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper vertex coloring of a graph is equitable if the sizes of all color classes differ by at most $1$. For a list assignment $L$ of $k$ colors to each vertex of an $n$-vertex graph $G$, an equitable $L$-coloring of $G$ is a proper coloring of vertices of $G$ from their lists such that no color is used more than $\lceil n/k\rceil$ times. Call a graph equitably $k$-choosable if it has an equitable $L$-coloring for every $k$-list assignment $L$. A graph $G$ is $(a,b)$-sparse if for every $A\subseteq V(G)$, the number of edges in the subgraph $G[A]$ of $G$ induced by $A$ is at most $a|A|+b$.
  Our first main result is that every $(\frac{7}{6},\frac{1}{3})$-sparse graph with minimum degree at least $2$ is equitably $3$-colorable and equitably $3$-choosable. This is sharp. Our second main result is that every $(\frac{5}{4},\frac{1}{2})$-sparse graph with minimum degree at least $2$ is equitably $4$-colorable and equitably $4$-choosable. This is also sharp.
  One of the tools in the proof is the new notion of strongly equitable (SE) list coloring. This notion is both stronger and more natural than equitable list coloring; and our upper bounds are for SE list coloring.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of crossings in two-step puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a formula which gives the number of occurrences of certain labels and local configurations inside two-step puzzles introduced by Buch, Kresch, Purbhoo and Tamvakis from the work of Knutson. Puzzles are tilings of the triangular lattice by edge labeled tiles and are known to compute the Schubert structure constants of the cohomology of two-step flag varieties. The formula that we obtain depends only on the boundary conditions of the puzzle. The proof is based on the study of color maps which are tilings of the triangular lattice by edge labeled tiles obtained from puzzles.</description>

Abstract: Eulerian polynomials record the distribution of descents over permutations. Caylerian polynomials likewise record the distribution of descents over Cayley permutations. Using combinatorial species and sign-reversing involutions we derive counting formulas and generating functions for the Caylerian polynomials as well as for related refined polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Sylvester question in $\mathbb{R}^d$: convex sets with a flat floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pick $n$ independent and uniform random points $U_1,\ldots,U_n$ in a compact convex set $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with volume 1, and let $P^{(d)}_K(n)$ be the probability that these points are in convex position. The Sylvester conjecture in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is that $\min_K P^{(d)}_K(d+2)$ is achieved by the $d$-dimensional simplices $K$ (only).
  In this paper, we focus on a companion model, already studied in the $2d$ case, which we define in any dimension $d$: we say that $K$ has $F$ as a flat floor, if $F$ is a subset of $K$, contained in a hyperplan $P$, such that $K$ lies in one of the half-spaces defined by $P$.
  We define $Q_K^F(n)$ as the probability that $U_1,\cdots,U_n$ together with $F$ are in convex position (i.e., the $U_i$ are on the boundary of the convex hull ${\sf CH}(\{U_1,\cdots,U_n\}\cup F\})$). We prove that, for all fixed $F$,
  $K\mapsto Q_K^F(2)$ reaches its minimum on the "mountains" with floor $F$ (mountains are convex hull of $F$ union an additional vertex), while the maximum is not reached, but $K\mapsto Q_K^F(2)$ has values arbitrary close to 1. If the optimisation is done on the set of $K$ contained in $F\times[0,d]$ (the "subprism case"), then the minimum is also reached by the mountains, and the maximum by the "prism" $F\times[0,1]$. Since again, $Q_K^F{(2)}$ relies on the expected volume (of ${\sf CH}(\{V_1,V_2\}\cup F\})$), this result can be seen as a proof of the Sylvester problem in the floor case.
  In $2d$, where $F$ can essentially be the segment $[0,1],$ we give a general decomposition formula for $Q_K^F(n)$ so to compute several formulas and bounds for different $K$. In 3D, we give some bounds for $Q_K^F(n)$ for various floors $F$ and special cases of $K$.</description>

      <title>Generating Series of Key Polynomials and Bounded Ascending Sequences of Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fact that Schubert polynomials are the weighted counting functions for reduced RC-graphs, also known as reduced pipe dreams, was established using their generating functions inside an appropriate Demazure algebra. Here we investigate the generating functions of another family of polynomials, the key polynomials, also known as Demazure characters. Each component in that function is a rational function, whose denominator is an explicit product whose definition is based on bounded ascending sequences of integers. We determine the first terms of the polynomial numerator, and pose conjectures about these terms in general as well as some of the next ones. The form of our generating functions suggests relations between the coefficients in key polynomials and signed sums of numbers of integral points on polytopes.</description>

      <title>Anti-Ramsey Number of Friendship Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph is called \textit{rainbow graph} if all the colors on its edges are distinct. For a given positive integer $n$ and a family of graphs $\mathcal{G}$, the anti-Ramsey number $ar(n, \mathcal{G})$ is the smallest number of colors $r$ required to ensure that, no matter how the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ are colored using exactly $r$ colors, there will always be a rainbow copy of some graph $G$ from the family $\mathcal{G}$. A friendship graph $F_k$ is the graph obtained by combining $k$ triangles that share a common vertex. In this paper, we determine the anti-Ramsey number $ar(n, \{F_k\})$ for large values of $n$. Additionally, we also determine the $ar(n, \{K_{1,k}, M_k\}$, where $K_{1,k}$ is a star graph with $ k+1$ vertices and $M_k$ is a matching of size $k$.</description>

      <title>A result for hemi-bundled cross-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are called cross-intersecting if for every $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$, the intersection $F\cap G$ is non-empty. It is significant to determine the maximum sum of sizes of cross-intersecting families under the additional assumption that one of the two families is intersecting. Such a pair of families is said to be hemi-bundled. In particular, Frankl (2016) proved that for $k \geq 1, t\ge 0$ and $n \geq 2 k+t$, if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k+t}$ and $\mathcal{G} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ are cross-intersecting families, in which $\mathcal{F}$ is non-empty and $(t+1)$-intersecting, then $|\mathcal{F}|+|\mathcal{G}| \leq\binom{n}{k}-\binom{n-k-t}{k}+1$. This bound can be attained when $\mathcal{F}$ consists of a single set. In this paper, we generalize this result under the constraint $|\mathcal{F}| \geq r$ for every $r\leq n-k-t+1$. Moreover, we investigate the stability results of Katona's theorem for non-uniform families with the $s$-union property. Our result extends the stabilities established by Frankl (2017) and Li and Wu (2024). As applications, we revisit a recent result of Frankl and Wang (2024) as well as a result of Kupavskii (2018). Furthermore, we determine the extremal families in these two results.</description>

      <title>The Game Value of Sequential Compounds of Integers and Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combinatorial game is a two-player game without hidden information or chance elements. One of the major approaches to analyzing games in combinatorial game theory is to break down a given game position into a disjunctive sum of multiple sub-positions, then evaluate the game value of each component of the sum, and finally integrate these game values to find which player has a winning strategy in the whole position. Accordingly, finding the game value of a given position is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. The sequential compound proposed by Stromquist and Ullman is a combinatorial game consisting of two combinatorial games. In the sequential compound of games $G$ and $H$, the players make moves on $G$ until $G$ is over, and then they play on $H$. In this paper, we investigate the general properties of sequential compounds. As the main result, we give the game values of sequential compounds of a finite number of integers and stars, which are basic and typical games in combinatorial game theory.</description>

      <title>Long induced paths in sparse graphs and graphs with forbidden patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a graph $G$ with a path $P$ of order $n$. What conditions force $G$ to also have a long induced path? As complete bipartite graphs have long paths but no long induced paths, a natural restriction is to forbid some fixed complete bipartite graph $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph. In this case we show that $G$ has an induced path of order $(\log \log n)^{1/5-o(1)}$. This is an exponential improvement over a result of Galvin, Rival, and Sands (1982) and comes close to a recent upper bound of order $O((\log \log n)^2)$.
  Another way to approach this problem is by viewing $G$ as an ordered graph (where the vertices are ordered according to their position on the path $P$). From this point of view it is most natural to consider which ordered subgraphs need to be forbidden in order to force the existence of a long induced path. Focusing on the exclusion of ordered matchings, we improve or recover a number of existing results with much simpler proofs, in a unified way. We also show that if some forbidden ordered subgraph forces the existence of a long induced path in $G$, then this induced path has size at least $\Omega((\log \log \log n)^{1/3})$, and can be chosen to be increasing with respect to $P$.</description>

      <title>On the Terwilliger algebra of the group association scheme of the symmetric group $\operatorname {sym}(7)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terwilliger algebras are finite-dimensional semisimple algebras that were first introduced by Paul Terwilliger in 1992 in studies of association schemes and distance-regular graphs. The Terwilliger algebras of the conjugacy class association schemes of the symmetric groups $\operatorname {sym}(n)$, for $3\leq n \leq 6$, have been studied and completely determined. The case for $\operatorname {sym}(7)$ is computationally much more difficult and has a potential application to find the size of the largest permutation codes of $\operatorname {sym}(7)$ with a minimal distance of at least $4$. In this paper, the dimension, the Wedderburn decomposition, and the block dimension decomposition of the Terwilliger algebra of the conjugacy class scheme of the group $\operatorname {sym}(7)$ are determined.</description>

      <title>Sparser Abelian High Dimensional Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new explicit constructions of Cayley high dimensional expanders (HDXs) over the abelian group $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. Our expansion proofs use only linear algebra and combinatorial arguments.
  The first construction gives local spectral HDXs of any constant dimension and subpolynomial degree $\exp(n^\epsilon)$ for every $\epsilon &gt;0$, improving on a construction by Golowich [Gol23] which achieves $\epsilon =1/2$. [Gol23] derives these HDXs by sparsifying the complete Grassmann poset of subspaces. The novelty in our construction is the ability to sparsify any expanding Grassmannian posets, leading to iterated sparsification and much smaller degrees. The sparse Grassmannian (which is of independent interest in the theory of HDXs) serves as the generating set of the Cayley graph.
  Our second construction gives a 2-dimensional HDXs of any polynomial degree $\exp(\epsilon n$) for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, which is simultaneously a spectral expander and a coboundary expander. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such non-trivial construction. We name it the Johnson complex, as it is derived from the classical Johnson scheme, whose vertices serve as the generating set of this Cayley graph. This construction may be viewed as a derandomization of the recent random geometric complexes of [LMSY23]. Establishing coboundary expansion through Gromov's "cone method" and the associated isoperimetric inequalities is the most intricate aspect of this construction.
  While these two constructions are quite different, we show that they both share a common structure, resembling the intersection patterns of vectors in the Hadamard code. We propose a general framework of such "Hadamard-like" constructions in the hope that it will yield new HDXs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $SPP(n)$ be the set $\{\big(|A+A|,|A\cdot A|\big) : A\subseteq {\mathbb N}, |A|=n \}$, where $A+A$ is the sumset $\{a+b : a,b\in A\}$ and $AA$ is the product set $\{ab : a,b\in A\}$. We prove the value of $SPP(n)$ exactly for $n\le 6$, and compute a large subset of $SPP(n)$ for $n\le 32$. This is a dataset of 1,158,717 sets of positive integers that are addtiively and multiplicatively diverse. We do {\bf not} see evidence in favor of Erd\H{o}s's Sum-Product Conjecture in our dataset. We include a number of conjectures, open problems, and observations motivated by this dataset, and a large number of color visualizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study skew-tolerant Gray codes, which are Gray codes in which changes in consecutive codewords occur in adjacent positions. We present the first construction of asymptotically non-vanishing skew-tolerant Gray codes, offering an exponential improvement over the known construction. We also provide linear-time encoding and decoding algorithms for our codes. Finally, we extend the definition to non-binary alphabets, and provide constructions of complete $m$-ary skew-tolerant Gray codes for every base $m\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Efficient encoding and decoding algorithm for a class of perfect single-deletion-correcting permutation codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A permutation code is a nonlinear code whose codewords are permutation of a set of symbols. We consider the use of permutation code in the deletion channel, and consider the symbol-invariant error model, meaning that the values of the symbols that are not removed are not affected by the deletion. In 1992, Levenshtein gave a construction of perfect single-deletion-correcting permutation codes that attain the maximum code size. Furthermore, he showed in the same paper that the set of all permutations of a given length can be partitioned into permutation codes so constructed. This construction relies on the binary Varshamov-Tenengolts codes. In this paper we give an independent and more direct proof of Levenshtein's result that does not depend on the Varshamov-Tenengolts code. Using the new approach, we devise efficient encoding and decoding algorithms that correct one deletion.</description>

Abstract: We show that the set of locally finite Borel graphs with finite Borel asymptotic dimension is $\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2$-complete. The result is based on a combinatorial characterization of finite Borel asymptotic dimension for graphs generated by a single Borel function. As an application of this characterization, we classify the complexities of digraph homomorphism problems for this class of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to study the restriction conjecture using decoupling theorems and two-ends Furstenberg inequalities. Specifically, we pose a two-ends Furstenberg conjecture, which implies the restriction conjecture. As evidence, we prove this conjecture in the plane by using the Furstenberg set estimate. Moreover, we use this planar result to prove a restriction estimate for $p&gt;22/7$ in three dimensions, which implies Wolff's $5/2$-hairbrush bound for Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Our approach also makes improvements for the restriction conjecture in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the maximum degree of induced subgraphs of the Kneser graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06370v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integers $n \geq k \geq 1$, the {\em Kneser graph} $K(n, k)$ is the graph with vertex-set consisting of all the $k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, where two $k$-element sets are adjacent in $K(n,k)$ if they are disjoint. We show that if $(n,k,s) \in \mathbb{N}^3$ with $n &gt; 10000 k s^5$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is set of vertices of $K(n,k)$ of size larger than $\{A \subset \{1,2,\ldots,n\}:\ |A|=k,\ A \cap \{1,2,\ldots,s\} \neq \varnothing\}$, then the subgraph of $K(n,k)$ induced by $\mathcal{F}$ has maximum degree at least \[ \left(1 - O\left(\sqrt{s^3 k/n}\right)\right)\frac{s}{s+1} \cdot {n-k \choose k} \cdot \frac{|\mathcal{F}|}{\binom{n}{k}}.\] This is sharp up to the behaviour of the error term $O(\sqrt{s^3 k/n})$. In particular, if the triple of integers $(n, k, s)$ satisfies the condition above, then the minimum maximum degree does not increase `continuously' with $|\mathcal{F}|$. Instead, it has $s$ jumps, one at each time when $|\mathcal{F}|$ becomes just larger than the union of $i$ stars, for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, s$. An appealing special case of the above result is that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of $k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with $|\mathcal{F}| = {n-1 \choose k-1}+1$, then there exists $A \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $\mathcal{F}$ is disjoint from at least $$\left(1/2-O\left(\sqrt{k/n}\right)\right){n-k-1 \choose k-1}$$ of the other sets in $\mathcal{F}$; this is asymptotically sharp if $k=o(n)$. Frankl and Kupavskii, using different methods, have recently proven closely related results under the hypothesis that $n$ is at least quadratic in $k$.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees for many different numbers of leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and $L(G)$ the set of all integers $k$ such that $G$ contains a spanning tree with exactly $k$ leaves. We show that for a connected graph $G$, the set $L(G)$ is contiguous. It follows from work of Chen, Ren, and Shan that every connected and locally connected $n$-vertex graph -- this includes triangulations -- has a spanning tree with at least $n/2 + 1$ leaves, so by a classic theorem of Whitney and our result, in any plane $4$-connected $n$-vertex triangulation one can find for any integer $k$ which is at least $2$ and at most $n/2 + 1$ a spanning tree with exactly $k$ leaves (and each of these trees can be constructed in polynomial time). We also prove that there exist infinitely many $n$ such that there is a plane $4$-connected $n$-vertex triangulation containing a spanning tree with $2n/3$ leaves, but no spanning tree with more than $2n/3$ leaves.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues and graph minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $spex(n,H_{minor})$ denote the maximum spectral radius of $n$-vertex $H$-minor free graphs. The problem on determining this extremal value can be dated back to the early 1990s. Up to now, it has been solved for $n$ sufficiently large and some special minors, such as $\{K_{2,3},K_4\}$, $\{K_{3,3},K_5\}$, $K_r$ and $K_{s,t}$. In this paper, we find some unified phenomena on general minors. Every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with spectral radius $\rho\geq spex(n,H_{minor})$ contains either an $H$ minor or a spanning book $K_{\gamma_H}\nabla(n-\gamma_H)K_1$, where $\gamma_H=|H|-\alpha(H)-1$. Furthermore, assume that $G$ is $H$-minor free and $\Gamma^*_s(H)$ is the family of $s$-vertex irreducible induced subgraphs of $H$, then $G$ minus its $\gamma_H$ dominating vertices is $\Gamma^*_{\alpha(H)+1}(H)$-minor saturate, and it is further edge-maximal if $\Gamma^*_{\alpha(H)+1}(H)$ is a connected family. As applications, we obtain some known results on minors mentioned above. We also determine the extremal values for some other minors, such as flowers, wheels, generalized books and complete multi-partite graphs. Our results extend some conjectures on planar graphs, outer-planar graphs and $K_{s,t}$-minor free graphs. To obtain the results, we combine stability method, spectral techniques and structural analyses. Especially, we give an exploration of using absorbing method in spectral extremal problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of ordinal concavity of utility functions has recently been considered by Hafalir, Kojima, Yenmez, and Yokote in economics while there exist earlier related works in discrete optimization and operations research. In the present note we consider functions satisfying ordinal concavity and introduce a weaker notion of ordinal weak-concavity as well. We also investigate useful behaviors of ordinally (weak-)concave functions and related choice correspondences, show a characterization of ordinally weak-concave functions, and give an efficient algorithm for maximizing ordinally concave functions. We further examine a duality in ordinally (weak-)concave functions and introduce the lexicographic composition of ordinally weak-concave functions.</description>

      <title>A conjectural basis for the $(1,2)$-bosonic-fermionic coinvariant ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the first conjectural construction of a monomial basis for the coinvariant ring $R_n^{(1,2)}$, for the symmetric group $S_n$ acting on one set of bosonic (commuting) and two sets of fermionic (anticommuting) variables. Our construction interpolates between the modified Motzkin path basis for $R_n^{(0,2)}$ of Kim-Rhoades (2022) and the super-Artin basis for $R_n^{(1,1)}$ conjectured by Sagan-Swanson (2024) and proven by Angarone et al. (2024). We prove that our proposed basis has cardinality $2^{n-1}n!$, aligning with a conjecture of Zabrocki (2020) on the dimension of $R_n^{(1,2)}$, and show how it gives a combinatorial expression for the Hilbert series. We also conjecture a Frobenius series for $R_n^{(1,2)}$. We show that these proposed Hilbert and Frobenius series are equivalent to conjectures of Iraci, Nadeau, and Vanden Wyngaerd (2024) on $R_n^{(1,2)}$ in terms of segmented Smirnov words, by exhibiting a weight-preserving bijection between our proposed basis and their segmented permutations. We extend some of their results on the sign character to hook characters, and give a formula for the $m_\mu$ coefficients of the conjectural Frobenius series. Finally, we conjecture a monomial basis for the analogous ring in type $B_n$, and show that it has cardinality $4^nn!$.</description>

Abstract: A family of lines passing through the origin in an inner product space is said to be equiangular if every pair of lines defines the same angle. In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel raised what has since become a central question in the study of equiangular lines in Euclidean spaces. They asked for the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$ with a common angle of $\arccos{\frac{1}{2k-1}}$ for any integer $k \geq 2$. We show that the answer equals $r-1+\left\lfloor\frac{r-1}{k-1}\right\rfloor,$ provided that $r$ is at least exponential in a polynomial in $k$. This improves upon a recent breakthrough of Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang, and Zhao [Ann. of Math. (2) 194 (2021), no. 3, 729-743], who showed that this holds for $r$ at least doubly exponential in a polynomial in $k$. We also show that for any common angle $\arccos{\alpha}$, the answer equals $r+o(r)$ already when $r$ is superpolynomial in $1/\alpha \to \infty$.
  The key new ingredient underlying our results is an improved upper bound on the multiplicity of the second-largest eigenvalue of a graph. In one of the regimes, this improves and significantly extends a result of McKenzie, Rasmussen, and Srivastava [STOC 2021, pp. 396-407].</description>

      <title>The 2-burning number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time model for the spread of information in a graph, motivated by the idea that people believe a story when they learn of it from two different origins. Similar to the burning number, in this problem, information spreads in rounds and a new source can appear in each round. For a graph $G$, we are interested in $b_2(G)$, the minimum number of rounds until the information has spread to all vertices of graph $G$. We are also interested in finding $t_2(G)$, the minimum number of sources necessary so that the information spreads to all vertices of $G$ in $b_2(G)$ rounds. In addition to general results, we find $b_2(G)$ and $t_2(G)$ for the classes of spiders and wheels and show that their behavior differs with respect to these two parameters. We also provide examples and prove upper bounds for these parameters for Cartesian products of graphs.</description>

      <title>Some Results on Digital Segments and Balanced Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit combinatorial results on Christoffel words and binary balanced words that are motivated by their geometric interpretation as approximations of digital segments. We give a closed formula for counting the exact number of balanced words with $a$ zeroes and $b$ ones. We also study minimal non-balanced words.</description>

      <title>Tiling, spectrality and aperiodicity of connected sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14028v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a set of finite measure. The periodic tiling conjecture suggests that if $\Omega$ tiles $\mathbb{R}^d$ by translations then it admits at least one periodic tiling. Fuglede's conjecture suggests that $\Omega$ admits an orthogonal basis of exponential functions if and only if it tiles $\mathbb{R}^d$ by translations. Both conjectures are known to be false in sufficiently high dimensions, with all the so-far-known counterexamples being highly disconnected. On the other hand, both conjectures are known to be true for convex sets. In this work we study these conjectures for connected sets. We show that the periodic tiling conjecture, as well as both directions of Fuglede's conjecture are false for connected sets in sufficiently high dimensions.</description>
