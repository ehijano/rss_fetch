      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of the Non-resonance Eigenvalues of the Fractional Schr\"odinger Operator with Neumann Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical investigation of the asymptotic behavior of non-resonance eigenvalues for the fractional Schr\"odinger operator under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Our findings reveal an intriguing convergence: as the system evolves, the eigenvalues of the fractional Schr\"odinger operator increasingly resemble those of the fractional Laplace operator. By deriving a precise asymptotic formula, we provide new insights into the spectral properties of these operators, highlighting their deeper connections and potential applications in mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>The Critical Point Degree of a Periodic Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical point degree of a periodic graph operator is the number of critical points of its complex Bloch variety. Determining it is a step towards the spectral edges conjecture and more generally understanding Bloch varieties. Previous work showed that it is bounded above by the volume of the Newton polytope of the graph, and that the inequality is strict when there are asymptotic critical points. We identify contributions from asymptotic critical points that arise from the structure of the graph, and show that the critical point degree is bounded above by the difference of the volume of the Newton polytope and these contributions. These results have implications for nonlinear optimization.</description>

      <title>Weak coupling for Schr\"odinger operators with complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrete eigenvalues emerging from the threshold of the essential spectrum of one or two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with complex-valued $ L^p $-potentials in a weak coupling regime. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the potential for the existence or absence of discrete eigenvalues in this regime and also analyze their uniqueness and algebraic multiplicity. Our results can be viewed as natural non-self-adjoint extensions of the well-known classical weak coupling phenomenon for self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators with real-valued potentials going back half a century to Simon's famous paper [Simon 1976].</description>

      <title>On the nullspace of split graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nullspace of the adjacency matrix of split graphs, whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. We introduce the clique-kernel, a subspace that determines when vertices of the clique appear in the support of a kernel eigenvector. We prove that this subspace is at most one-dimensional, leading to the formula $null(Sp) = null(R) + \dim(\mathrm{Cker}(Sp))$, which fully describes the nullity of a split graph in terms of the bipartite adjacency submatrix $R$. We also analyze unbalanced split graphs through the concept of swing vertices and characterize the structure of their kernel supports. Furthermore, we study the behavior of the nullspace under Tyshkevich composition and derive a closed formula for the determinant using the Schur complement. These results provide a unified algebraic framework for understanding when a split graph is singular and how its combinatorial structure determines its nullspace.</description>

      <title>The fibered rotation number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an explicit formula for an increment of the fibered rotation number of a one-parameter family of circle cocycles over any ergodic transformation in terms of invariant measures. As an application, for a family of random dynamical systems on the circle, this gives a formula for an increment of the rotation number in terms of the stationary measures. In the case of projective Schr\"odinger cocycles associated with the Anderson Model, that provides a relation between the properties of the stationary measures on the projective space and the integrated density of states (IDS) of the corresponding family of operators. In particular, it gives a dynamical proof of H\"older regularity of the IDS in Anderson Model. Finally, we prove that the IDS for the Anderson Model with an ergodic background must be H\"older continuous.</description>

      <title>Basis Choices for Frequency Domain Statistical Independence Tests and Algorithms for Algebraic Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how different selections of basis functions impact the efficacy of frequency domain techniques in statistical independence tests, and study different algorithms for extracting low-dimensional algebraic relations from dependent data. We examine a range of complete orthonormal bases functions including the Legendre polynomials, Fourier series, Walsh functions, and standard and nonstandard Haar wavelet bases. We utilize fast transformation algorithms to efficiently transform physical domain data to frequency domain coefficients. The main focuses of this paper are the effectiveness of different basis selections in detecting data dependency using frequency domain data, e.g., whether varying basis choices significantly influence statistical power loss for small data with large noise; and on the stability of different optimization formulations for finding proper algebraic relations when data are dependent. We present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency domain-based statistical analysis methods and provide guidance for selecting the proper basis and algorithm to detect a particular type of relations.</description>

      <title>On the Krein-Rutman theorem and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the Krein-Rutman theory for semigroups of positive operators in a Banach lattice framework and we provide some very general, efficient and handy results with constructive estimates about: the existence of a solution to the first eigentriplet problem; the geometry of the principal eigenvalue problem; the asymptotic stability of the first eigenvector with possible constructive rate of convergence. This abstract theory is motivated and illustrated by several examples of differential, integro-differential and integral operators. In particular, we revisit the first eigenvalue problem and the asymptotic stability of the first eigenvector for: some parabolic equations in a bounded domain and in the whole space; some transport equations in a bounded or unbounded domain, including some growth-fragmentation models and some kinetic models; the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation in the torus and in the whole space; some mutation-selection models.</description>

      <title>Koopman operators with intrinsic observables in rigged reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetEDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetEDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also investigate the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of an extended Koopman operator within a framework of a rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the H\'enon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetEDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Decomposing tensors via rank-one approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrices can be decomposed via rank-one approximations: the best rank-one approximation is a singular vector pair, and the singular value decomposition writes a matrix as a sum of singular vector pairs. The singular vector tuples of a tensor are the critical points of its best rank-one approximation problem. In this paper, we study tensors that can be decomposed via successive rank-one approximations: compute a singular vector tuple, subtract it off, compute a singular vector tuple of the new deflated tensor, and repeat. The number of terms in such a decomposition may exceed the tensor rank. Moreover, the decomposition may depend on the order in which terms are subtracted. We show that the decomposition is valid independent of order if and only if all singular vectors in the process are orthogonal in at least two factors. We study the variety of such tensors. We lower bound its dimension, showing that it is significantly larger than the variety of odeco tensors.</description>

      <title>Improvement of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for balls and cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: P\'{o}lya's conjecture on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian has been one of the core problems in spectral geometry. Building upon the recent breakthrough works on P\'{o}lya's conjecture for balls and annuli by Filonov, Levitin, Polterovich and Sher, we study several aspects of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for balls and cylinders: by refining the purely analytical portion of the proof in [2] for the Neumann P\'{o}lya's conjecture for the disk, we extend the regime of the spectral parameter that can be established without computer assistance; we obtain improvement of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for disks and balls; we obtain improvement of P\'{o}lya's conjecture for cylinders and confirm the Neumann P\'{o}lya's conjecture for cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^3$. As a supplementary effort, we study Weyl's law for cylinders.</description>
