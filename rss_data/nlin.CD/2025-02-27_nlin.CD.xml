      <title>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19063v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</description>

      <title>Shell Models on Recurrent Sequences: Fibonacci, Padovan and Other Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new class of shell models is proposed, where the shell variables are defined on a recurrent sequence of integer wave-numbers such as the Fibonacci or the Padovan series, or their variations including a sequence made of square roots of Fibonacci numbers rounded to the nearest integer. Considering the simplest model, which involves only local interactions, the interaction coefficients can be generalized in such a way that the inviscid invariants, such as energy and helicity, can be conserved even though there is no exact self-similarity. It is shown that these models basically have identical features with standard shell models, and produce the same power law spectra, similar spectral fluxes and analogous deviation from self-similar scaling of the structure functions implying comparable levels of turbulent intermittency. Such a formulation potentially opens up the possibility of using shell models, or their generalizations along with discretized regular grids, such as those found in direct numerical simulations, either as diagnostic tools, or subgrid models. It also allows to develop models where the wave-number shells can be interpreted as sparsely decimated sets of wave-numbers over an initially regular grid. In addition to conventional shell models with local interactions that result in forward cascade, a particular helical shell model with long range interactions is considered on a similarly recurrent sequence of wave numbers, corresponding to the Fibonacci series, and found to result in the usual inverse cascade.</description>

      <title>Unorientable topological gravity and orthogonal random matrix universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The duality of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and a double scaled matrix integral has led to studies of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in the so called $\tau-$scaled limit of large times, $t \to \infty$, and fixed temperature in order to demonstrate agreement with universal random matrix theory (RMT). Though this has been established for the unitary case, extensions to other symmetry classes requires the inclusion of unorientable manifolds in the sum over geometries, necessary to address time reversal invariance, and regularization of the corresponding prime geometrical objects, the Weil-Petersson (WP) volumes. We report here how universal signatures of quantum chaos, witnessed by the fidelity to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, emerge for the low-energy limit of unorientable JT gravity, i.e. the Airy model/topological gravity. To this end, we implement the loop equations for the corresponding dual (double-scaled) matrix model and find the generic form of the Airy WP volumes, supported by calculations using unorientable Kontsevich graphs. In an apparent violation of the gravity/chaos duality, the $\tau-$scaled SFF on the gravity side acquires both logarithmic and power law contributions in $t$, not manifestly present on the RMT side. We show the expressions can be made to agree by means of bootstrapping-like relations hidden in the asymptotic expansions of generalized hypergeometric functions. Thus, we are able to establish strong evidence of the quantum chaotic nature of unorientable topological gravity.</description>
