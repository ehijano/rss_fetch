      <title>Interactive Hypergraph Visual Analytics for Exploring Large and Complex Image Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing large complex image collections in domains like forensics, accident investigation, or social media analysis involves interpreting intricate, overlapping relationships among images. Traditional clustering and classification methods fail to adequately represent these complex relationships, particularly when labeled data or suitable pre-trained models are unavailable. Hypergraphs effectively capture overlapping relationships, but to translate their complexity into information and insights for domain expert users visualization is essential. We propose an interactive visual analytics approach specifically designed for the construction, exploration, and analysis of hypergraphs on large-scale complex image collections. Our core contributions include: (1) a scalable pipeline for constructing hypergraphs directly from raw image data, including a similarity measure to evaluate constructed hypergraphs against a ground truth, (2) interactive visualization techniques that integrate spatial hypergraph representations, interactive grids, and matrix visualizations, enabling users to dynamically explore and interpret relationships without becoming overwhelmed and disoriented, and (3) practical insights on how domain experts can effectively use the application, based on evaluation with real-life image collections. Our results demonstrate that our visual analytics approach facilitates iterative exploration, enabling domain experts to efficiently derive insights from image collections containing tens of thousands of images.</description>

      <title>Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time, unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

      <title>From Far and Near: Perceptual Evaluation of Crowd Representations Across Levels of Detail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how users perceive the visual quality of crowd character representations at different levels of detail (LoD) and viewing distances. Each representation: geometric meshes, image-based impostors, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and 3D Gaussians, exhibits distinct trade-offs between visual fidelity and computational performance. Our qualitative and quantitative results provide insights to guide the design of perceptually optimized LoD strategies for crowd rendering.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Feature Ordering in Radar Charts for Multi-Profile Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radar charts are widely used to visualize multivariate data and compare multiple profiles across features. However, the visual clarity of radar charts can be severely compromised when feature values alternate drastically in magnitude around the circle, causing areas to collapse, which misrepresents relative differences. In the present work we introduce a permutation optimization strategy that reorders features to minimize polygon ``spikiness'' across multiple profiles simultaneously. The method is combinatorial (exhaustive search) for moderate numbers of features and uses a lexicographic minimax criterion that first considers overall smoothness (mean jump) and then the largest single jump as a tie-breaker. This preserves more global information and produces visually balanced arrangements. We discuss complexity, practical bounds, and relations to existing approaches that either change the visualization (e.g., OrigamiPlot) or learn orderings (e.g., Versatile Ordering Network). An example with two profiles and $p=6$ features (before/after ordering) illustrates the qualitative improvement.

      <title>GenLit: Reformulating Single-Image Relighting as Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11224v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the implicit scene understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows and inter-reflections. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape, and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or ray-tracing. .
