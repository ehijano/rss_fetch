      <title>Barium Titanate and Lithium Niobate Permittivity and Pockels Coefficients from MHz to Sub-THz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pockels effect is essential for controlling optical signals at the highest speeds. We present the first measurements of the Pockels coefficients and permittivity in lithium niobate (LN) and barium titanate (BTO) over a continuous frequency range from 100 MHz to 330 GHz. These properties are constant across this frequency range in LN but have a significant frequency dependence in BTO. Still, our measurements show that BTO ($\varepsilon$ = 1136, $r_{42}$ = 481 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 125 pm/V at 100 MHz, $\varepsilon$ = 453, $r_{42}$ = 191 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 60 pm/V at 330 GHz) has remarkably large electro-optic properties compared to LN ($\varepsilon$ = 27, $r_{42}$ = 15 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 27 pm/V). Furthermore, we show how BTO devices can be designed with a flat electro-optic frequency response despite the Pockels coefficient dispersion. Finally, we expound our method for broadband characterization of these vital electro-optic properties, utilizing specialized integrated electro-optic phase shifters. Altogether, this work is foundational to designing high-speed BTO devices and to developing new electro-optic materials.</description>

      <title>Parallel fast random bit generation based on spectrotemporally uncorrelated Brillouin random fiber lasing oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations existing between spectral components in multi-wavelength lasers have been the key challenge that hinders these laser sources from being developed to chaotic comb entropy sources for parallel random bit generation. Herein, spectrotemporally uncorrelated multi-order Stokes/anti-Stokes emissions are achieved by cooperatively exploiting nonlinear optical processes including cascaded stimulated Brillouin scattering and quasi-phase-matched four-wave mixing in a Brillouin random fiber laser. Chaotic instabilities induced by random mode resonance are enhanced and disorderly redistributed among different lasing lines through complex nonlinear optical interactions, which comprehensively releases the inherent correlation among multiple Stokes/anti-Stokes emission lines, realizing a chaotic frequency comb with multiple spectrotemporally uncorrelated channels. Parallel fast random bit generation is fulfilled with 31 channels, single-channel bit rate of 35-Gbps and total bit rate of 1.085-Tbps. National Institute of Standards and Technology statistic tests verify the randomness of generated bit streams. This work, in a simple and efficient way, breaks the correlation barrier for utilizing multi-wavelength laser to achieve high-quality spectrotemporally uncorrelated chaotic laser source, opening new avenues for achieving greatly accelerated random bit generation through parallelization and potentially revolutionizing the current architecture of secure communication and high-performance computation.</description>

      <title>Controlling quasi-parametric amplifications: From multiple PT-symmetry phase transitions to non-Hermitian sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-parametric amplification (QPA) is a nonlinear interaction in which the idler wave is depleted through some loss mechanism. QPA plays an important role in signal amplification in ultrafast photonics and quantum light generation. The QPA process has a number of features characterized by the non-Hermitian parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. In this report, we explore new interaction regimes and uncover multiple $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transitions in such QPA process where transitions are particularly sensitive to external parameters. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of detection of $10^{-11}$ inhomogeneities of the doped absorber, which is order of magnitude more sensitive than similar measurements performed in a linear absorption regime. In doing so, we reveal a family of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transitions appearing in the QPA process and provide a novel nonlinear optical sensing mechanism for precise optical measurements.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inverse Design of Plasmonic Patch Nanoantennas using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoantennas with suitable far-field characteristics are of huge interest for utilization in optical wireless links, inter-/intra-chip communications, LiDARs, and photonic integrated circuits due to their exceptional modal confinement. Despite its success in shaping robust antenna design theories in radio frequency and millimeter-wave regimes, conventional transmission line theory finds its validity diminished in the optical frequencies, leading to a noticeable void in a generalized theory for antenna design in the optical domain. By utilizing neural networks and through a one-time training of the network, one can transform the plasmonic nanoantennas design into an automated, data-driven task. In this work, we have developed a multi-head deep convolutional neural network serving as an efficient inverse-design framework for plasmonic patch nanoantennas. Our framework is designed with the main goal of determining the optimal geometries of nanoantennas to achieve the desired (inquired by the designer) S 11 and radiation pattern simultaneously. The proposed approach preserves the one-to-many mappings, enabling us to generate diverse designs. In addition, apart from the primary fabrication limitations that were considered while generating the dataset, further design and fabrication constraints can also be applied after the training process. In addition to possessing an exceptionally rapid surrogate solver capable of predicting S 11 and radiation patterns throughout the entire design frequency spectrum, we are introducing what we believe to be the pioneering inverse design network.</description>

      <title>Adaptive sampling strategy for tolerance analysis of freeform optical surfaces based on critical ray aiming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tolerance analysis of freeform surfaces plays a crucial role in the development of advanced imaging systems. However, the intricate relationship between surface error and imaging quality poses significant challenges, necessitating dense sampling of featured rays during the computation process to ensure an accurate tolerance for different fields of view (FOVs). Here, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy called "Critical Ray Aiming" for surface tolerance analysis. By identifying the most sensitive ray to wave aberration at each surface point, our methodology facilitates flexible sampling of the FOVs and entrance pupil (EP), achieving computational efficiency without compromising accuracy in determining tolerable surface error. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through tolerance analysis of two different freeform imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions via attosecond x-ray absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical experiment that demonstrates the possibility to capture topological phase transitions via an x-ray absorption spectroscopy scheme. We consider a Chern insulator whose topological phase is tuned via a second-order hopping. We perform time-dynamics simulations of the out-of-equilibrium laser-driven electron motion that enables us to model a realistic attosecond spectroscopy scheme. In particular, we use an ultrafast scheme with a circularly polarized IR pump pulse and an attosecond x-ray probe pulse. A laser-induced dichroism-type spectrum shows a clear signature of the topological phase transition. We are able to connect these signatures with the Berry structure of the system. This work extend the applications of attosecond absorption spectroscopy to systems presenting a non-trivial topological phase.</description>

      <title>Mode visualisation and control of complex lasers using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behaviour of complex laser systems is an outstanding challenge, especially in the presence of nonlinear interactions between modes. Hidden features, such as the gain distributions and spatial localisation of lasing modes, often cannot be revealed experimentally, yet they are crucial to determining the laser action. Here, we introduce a lasing spectroscopy method that can visualise the gain profiles of the modes in complex lasers using an artificial neural network. The spatial gain distributions of different lasing modes in a disorderly coupled microring array are reconstructed without prior knowledge of the laser topology. We further extend the neural network to a tandem neural network that can control the laser emission by matching the modal gain/loss profile to selectively enhance the targeted modes. This mode visualisation method offers a new approach to extracting hidden spatial mode features from photonic structures, which could improve our understanding and control of complex photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Compact ultra-broadband light coupling on chip via nonadiabatic pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enlarging bandwidth capacity of the integrated photonic systems demands efficient and broadband light coupling among optical elements, which has been a vital issue in integrated photonics. Here, we have developed a compact ultra-broadband light coupling strategy based on nonadiabatic pumping in coupled optical waveguides, and experimentally demonstrated the designs in thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform. We found that nonadiabatic transition would produce a decreased dispersion of the phases related to eigenstates in the waveguides. As a consequence, we realized high-efficiency directional transfer between edgestates for various wavelengths covering a 1-dB bandwidth of ~320 nm in experiment (&gt;400 nm in simulation), with a coupling length (~50 {\mu}m) approximately 1/10 of that required in the adiabatic regime. Furthermore, we have constructed complex functional devices including beamsplitter and multiple-level cascaded networks for broadband light routing and splitting. Our work preserves significant advantages simultaneously in extending the operation bandwidth and minimizing the footprint, which demonstrates great potential for large-scale and compact photonic integration on chip.</description>

      <title>Engineering Nonreciprocal Responses in Travelling-Wave Spacetime Crystals via Clausius-Mossotti Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the effective response of three-dimensional spacetime crystals formed by spherical scatterers under a travelling-wave modulation. We develop an analytical formalism to homogenize the spacetime crystals that extends the renowned Clausius-Mossotti formula to time-varying platforms. Our formalism shows that travelling-wave spacetime crystals can be used to engineer a wide range of classes of nonreciprocal bianisotropic couplings in the long wavelength limit. In particular, our theory reveals the possibility of realizing a purely isotropic Tellegen response in crystals formed by interlaced sub-lattices of scatterers subjected to different modulation velocities. Furthermore, we introduce a class of generalized Minkowskian crystals that displays invariance under arbitrary Lorentz boosts aligned with a fixed spatial direction. We prove that such systems are formed by pseudo-uniaxial materials with the principal axis aligned parallel to the modulation velocity. The electromagnetic response of such generalized Minkowskian crystals is indistinguishable from that of moving photonic crystals.</description>

      <title>Single-mode emission by phase-delayed coupling between nano-lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field coupling between nanolasers enables collective high-power lasing but leads to complex spectral reshaping and multimode operation, limiting the emission brightness, spatial coherence and temporal stability. Many lasing architectures have been proposed to circumvent this limitation, based on symmetries, topology, or interference. We show that a much simpler and robust method exploiting phase-delayed coupling, where light exchanged by the lasers carries a phase, can enable stable single-mode operation. Phase-delayed coupling changes the modal amplification: for pump powers close to the anyonic parity-time (PT) symmetric exceptional point, a high phase delay completely separates the mode thresholds, leading to single mode operation. This is shown by stability analysis with nonlinear coupled mode theory and stochastic differential equations for two coupled nanolasers and confirmed by realistic semi-analytical treatment of a dimer of lasing nanospheres. Finally, we extend the mode control to large arrays of nanolasers, featuring lowered thresholds and higher power. Our work promises a novel solution to engineer bright and stable single-mode lasing from nanolaser arrays with important applications in photonic chips for communication and lidars.</description>

      <title>Uncovering low-frequency vibrations in surface-enhanced Raman of organic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing the terahertz (THz) spectral domain through surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is challenging and opens up the study of low-frequency molecular and electronic excitations. Compared to direct THz probing of heterogenous ensembles, the extreme plasmonic confinement of visible light to deep sub-wavelength scales allows the study of hundreds or even single molecules. We show that self-assembled molecular monolayers of a set of simple aromatic thiols confined inside single-particle plasmonic nanocavities can be distinguished by their low-wavenumber spectral peaks below 200 cm-1, after removal of a bosonic inelastic contribution and an exponential background from the spectrum Developing environment-dependent density-functional-theory simulations of the metal-molecule configuration enables the assignment and classification of their THz vibrations as well as the identification of intermolecular coupling effects and of the influence of the gold surface configuration Furthermore, we show dramatically narrower THz SERS spectra from individual molecules at picocavities, which indicates the possibility to study intrinsic vibrational properties beyond inhomogeneous broadening further supporting the key role of local environment.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile reconfigurable polarization rotator at datacom wavelengths based on a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonics has become a key platform for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its high refractive index and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing. However, the inherent birefringence in silicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report a reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide operating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching with zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the interference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured by changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our experimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a polarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as -0.08 dB and 17.65 dB, respectively, in a compact footprint of just 21$\mu$m length. Therefore, the proposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for polarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in data communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from polarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal optical phonons in photonic time crystals containing a stationary charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentzian-type media support optical phonons that oscillate with longitudinal polarization parallel to the wave direction, at a wave vector-independent frequency at which the permittivity becomes zero. Here, we study the interactions between the longitudinal optical phonons and Lorentzian medium-based dispersive photonic time crystals (PTCs). We demonstrate that a stationary charge embedded in the PTCs can excite these longitudinal modes through the conversion of the static polarization field induced by the charge. Furthermore, the PTCs can develop a momentum bandgap across the entire wave vector space to amplify the longitudinal modes. Remarkably, this infinite momentum bandgap can be established with minimal temporal modulation of the refractive index when creating the PTCs. Our approach expands the range of waves that can be manipulated in PTCs and shows potential for observing momentum bandgap phenomenon in realistic optical experiments, where the modulation depth of the refractive index is severely constrained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optically high-quality single crystal of sodium mesitylene sulfonate crystal was successfully grown by a slow evaporation method using methanol as solvent at room temperature. Single-crystal XRD has characterized the material and belongs to a monoclinic structure with a C2 space group. Functional groups were determined using Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. The optical quality of the generated crystal was evaluated using UV-Vis NIR spectral analysis, which is transparent in the range of 300-1500 nm. We report the optical properties using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and THz generation using crystal.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution imaging of nanoscale inhomogeneities in hBN-covered and encapsulated few-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encapsulating few-layer graphene (FLG) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can cause nanoscale inhomogeneities in the FLG, including changes in stacking domains and topographic defects. Due to the diffraction limit, characterizing these inhomogeneities is challenging. Recently, the visualization of stacking domains in encapsulated four-layer graphene (4LG) has been demonstrated with phonon polariton (PhP)-assisted near-field imaging. However, the underlying coupling mechanism and ability to image subdiffractional-sized inhomogeneities remain unknown. Here, we retrieve direct replicas and magnified images of subdiffractional-sized inhomogeneities in hBN-covered trilayer graphene (TLG) and encapsulated 4LG, enabled by the hyperlensing effect. This hyperlensing effect is mediated by hBN's hyperbolic PhP that couple to the FLG's plasmon polaritons. Using near-field microscopy, we identify the coupling by determining the polariton dispersion in hBN-covered TLG to be stacking-dependent. Our work demonstrates super-resolution and magnified imaging of inhomogeneities, paving the way for the realization of homogeneous encapsulated FLG transport samples to study correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Tunable kHz distributed feedback fiber laser enabled by glass additive-manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For short sections of fibers tailored to a specific application, fast laser-based manufacturing techniques can be an attractive alternative to the often-cumbersome traditional manufacturing routes. Short, high gain fibers can be used in e.g., distributed feedback fiber lasers (DFFL) that offer sought after performance suitable for a broad range of applications in modern photonics. DFFLs offer superior stability and narrower linewidth compared to conventional fiber lasers. Tunable, narrow laser sources with output in eye-safe spectrum are desired for sensing, signal multiplexing, LIDAR systems etc. In this work we present DFFL obtained using Laser-Powder-Deposition made Er-doped silica fiber. Milliwatt level, ultra-narrow laser line (less than 4 kHz) was obtained using phase-shifted grating in 16 mm long fiber. The backward slope efficiency was as high as 24% when pumping at 976 nm. The results presented in this work showcase new possibilities in fiber fabrication that were unlocked through laser-assisted AM. This fiber laser sets the stage for the future of rapid fabrication of advanced fiber devices through unconventional manufacturing routes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, optical wavefront shaping has been developed to focus light through highly opaque scattering layers, opening new possibilities for biomedical applications. To probe light intensity deep inside soft scattering media such as biological tissues, internal guide-stars are required. Here, we give an overview of the main principles and describe in depth the use of a photoacoustic feedback signal for this purpose. We further present first principles calculations and simulations to estimate important experimental parameters, and detailed instructions on designing and conducting these experiments. Finally, we provide guidance towards selecting suitable equipment for building a typical experimental setup, paving the way for further innovative biomedical imaging and therapy applications.</description>

      <title>AI Driven Laser Parameter Search: Inverse Design of Photonic Surfaces using Greedy Surrogate-based Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic surfaces designed with specific optical characteristics are becoming increasingly important for use in in various energy harvesting and storage systems. , In this study, we develop a surrogate-based optimization approach for designing such surfaces. The surrogate-based optimization framework employs the Random Forest algorithm and uses a greedy, prediction-based exploration strategy to identify the laser fabrication parameters that minimize the discrepancy relative to a user-defined target optical characteristics. We demonstrate the approach on two synthetic benchmarks and two specific cases of photonic surface inverse design targets. It exhibits superior performance when compared to other optimization algorithms across all benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate a technique of inverse design warm starting for changed target optical characteristics which enhances the performance of the introduced approach.</description>

      <title>Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E&gt;E_0, while for E&lt;E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.</description>

      <title>Observation of Co-propagating Chiral Zero Modes in Magnetic Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological singularities, such as Weyl points and Dirac points, can give rise to unidirectional propagation channels known as chiral zero modes (CZMs) when subject to a magnetic field. These CZMs are responsible for intriguing phenomena like the chiral anomaly in quantum systems. The propagation direction of each CZM is determined by both the applied magnetic field and the topological charge of the singularity point. While counter-propagating CZMs have been observed in 2D and 3D systems, the realization of co-propagating CZMs has remained elusive. Here we present the first experimental observation of co-propagating CZMs in magnetic photonic crystals hosting a single pair of ideal Weyl points WPs. By manipulating the crystal's structural configuration, we spatially alter the locations of the WPs, creating pseudo-magnetic fields in opposite directions between them. This arrangement results in a pair of CZMs that possess the same group velocity and co-propagate. Our work opens up new possibilities for topological manipulation of wave propagation and may lead to advancements in optical waveguides, switches, and various other applications.</description>

      <title>Application of Magnus expansion for the quantum dynamics of $\Lambda$-systems under periodic driving and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing a sixth order expression for the differential time evolution operator based on the Magnus expansion (ME), we conducted quantum dynamics calculations of a $\Lambda$-system driven by two sinusoidal time dependent fields. For a closed system dynamics, we confirmed the equivalence of the dynamics in the Hilbert space and the Liouville space numerically. We also conducted open system quantum dynamics calculation by generalizing the ME to the non-Hermitian dynamics in the Liouville space for the case where the effects of photonic bath are represented by Lindblad operators. In both cases, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) was assessed. We found significant errors of RWA during initial stages of the dynamics for representative cases where electromagnetically induced transparency or coherent population trapping can be observed. The presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics reduces the errors of RWA, but significant errors for off-diagonal elements of the density operator can still be seen. We also found that approaches to steady state limits of exact dynamics are slower than those for RWA. These results demonstrate the utility of the ME as a general and reliable tool for closed and open system quantum dynamics for time dependent Hamiltonians, and expose potential issues of drawing conclusions based solely on RWA.</description>

Abstract: Entangled photon sources (EPSs) are pivotal in advancing quantum communication, computing and sensing. The demand for deploying efficient, robust EPSs in the field, characterized by exceptional (phase) stability, has become increasingly apparent. This work introduces a polarization-entangled photon source, leveraging type-0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and constructed using commercial bulk optomechanical components. Our system is versatile, enabling the generation of N00N states for sensing applications or Bell states for quantum key distribution protocols. We attained a maximal Bell inequality violation, with the average entanglement visibility exceeding 99% . The potential for further performance enhancements is also explored.</description>

      <title>Noise analysis of a quasi-phase-matched quantum frequency converter and higher-order counter-propagating SPDC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) will be an indispensable ingredient in future quantum technologies. For example, large-scale fibre-based quantum networks will require QFC to interconnect heterogeneous building blocks like emitters, channels, memories and detectors. The performance of existing QFC devices - typically realised in periodically-poled nonlinear crystals - is often severely limited by parasitic noise that arises when the pump wavelength lies between the wavelengths which are inter-converted. Here we investigate the noise spectrum of a frequency converter pumped by a CW 1064 nm laser. The converter was realised as a monolithic bulk pump enhancement cavity made from a periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (ppKTP) crystal - quasi-phase-matched for the conversion of 637 nm to 1587 nm. In the range from 1140 nm to 1330 nm (up to 60 THz from the pump) Stokes-Raman resonances can be identified as the dominant noise source while the noise in the range from 1330 nm to 1650 nm can be attributed mainly to parasitic spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Further, a succession of narrow-band peaks is observed in the spectrum originating from higher-order counter-propagating SPDC. Both types of counter-propagation, where either the lower-energy idler photon or the higher-energy signal photon counter-propagate relative to the pump beam, are observed, with narrow-band peaks corresponding to 10th to 44th order quasi-phase-matching.</description>

Abstract: Over the past two decades, photonics have been developed as technological solutions for astronomical instrumentation for, e.g., near-infrared spectroscopy and long baseline interferometry. With increasing instrument capabilities, large quantities of high precision optical components are required to guide, manipulate, and analyze the light from astronomical sources. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and fiber-based devices offer enormous potential for astronomical instrumentation, as they can reduce the amount of bulky free-space optics and pave the way for innovative solutions. Astrophotonic devices are particularly interesting for interferometry due to their compact design on the centimeter scale, even for a large number of telescope inputs. Already, astrophotonic components are integrated in high-end instruments at the VLTI and at the CHARA Array. Photonic beam combiners at wavelengths from visible to mid-infrared have been fabricated using lithographic techniques or ultrafast-laser inscription, with several components tested on-sky. This paper will provide a glimpse into the growing field of astrophotonics, its current status and potential for new technologies.</description>

      <title>Time-bin entangled Bell state generation and tomography on thin-film lithium niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical quantum communication technologies are making the prospect of unconditionally secure and efficient information transfer a reality. The possibility of generating and reliably detecting quantum states of light, with the further need of increasing the private data-rate is where most research efforts are focusing. The physical concept of entanglement is a solution guaranteeing the highest degree of security in device-independent schemes, yet its implementation and preservation over long communication links is hard to achieve. Lithium niobate-on-insulator has emerged as a revolutionising platform for high-speed classical telecommunication and is equally suited for quantum information applications owing to the large second-order nonlinearities that can efficiently produce entangled photon pairs. In this work, we generate maximally entangled quantum states in the time-bin basis using lithium niobate-on-insulator photonics at the fibre optics telecommunication wavelength, and reconstruct the density matrix by quantum tomography on a single photonic integrated circuit. We use on-chip periodically-poled lithium niobate as source of entangled qubits with a brightness of 242 MHz/mW and perform quantum tomography with a fidelity of 91.9+-1.0 %. Our results, combined with the established large electro-optic bandwidth of lithium niobate, showcase the platform as perfect candidate to realise fibre-coupled, high-speed time-bin quantum communication modules that exploit entanglement to achieve information security.</description>

      <title>Collective transition quenching in the presence of multiple competing decay channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for 'collective transition quenching', a quantum many-body dissipative phenomenon that occurs in systems with multiple collective decay channels. Despite the competition, interactions suppress all but the dominant decay transition, leading to a 'winner takes all' dynamic where the system primarily settles into the dominant ground state. We prove that, in the presence of permutation symmetry, this problem is exactly solvable for any number of competing channels. Additionally, we develop an approximate model for the dynamics by mapping the evolution into a continuity equation for a fluid, and show analytically that the dominant transition ratio converges to unity with increasing system size as a power-law, for any branching ratio. This near-deterministic preparation of the dominant ground state has broad applicability. As an example we discuss a protocol for molecular photoassociation where collective dynamics effectively acts as a catalyst, amplifying the yield in a particular final state. Our results open new avenues for many-body strategies in the preparation and control of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Transmission spectroscopy of CF$_4$ molecules in intense x-ray fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear interaction of x-rays with matter is at the heart of understanding and controlling ultrafast molecular dynamics from an atom-specific viewpoint, providing new scientific and analytical opportunities to explore the structure and dynamics of small quantum systems. At increasingly high x-ray intensity, the sensitivity of ultrashort x-ray pulses to specific electronic states and emerging short-lived transient intermediates is of particular relevance for our understanding of fundamental multi-photon absorption processes. In this work, intense x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses at the European XFEL (EuXFEL) are combined with a gas cell and grating spectrometer for a high-intensity transmission spectroscopy study of multiphoton-induced ultrafast molecular fragmentation dynamics in CF$_4$. This approach unlocks the direct intra-pulse observation of transient fragments, including neutral atoms, by their characteristic absorption lines in the transmitted broad-band x-ray spectrum. The dynamics with and without initially producing fluorine K-shell holes are studied by tuning the central photon energy. The absorption spectra are measured at different FEL intensities to observe nonlinear effects. Transient isolated fluorine atoms and ions are spectroscopically recorded within the ultrashort pulse duration of few tens of femtoseconds. An isosbestic point that signifies the correlated transition between intact neutral CF$_4$ molecules and charged atomic fragments is observed near the fluorine K-edge. The dissociation dynamics and the multiphoton absorption-induced dynamics encoded in the spectra are theoretically interpreted. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of high-intensity x-ray transmission spectroscopy to study ultrafast molecular dynamics with sensitivity to specific intermediate species and their electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Entropy Computing: A Paradigm for Optimization in an Open Quantum System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern quantum technologies using matter are designed as closed quantum systems to isolate them from interactions with the environment. This design paradigm greatly constrains the scalability and limits practical implementation of such systems. Here, we introduce a novel computing paradigm, entropy computing, that works by conditioning a quantum reservoir thereby enabling the stabilization of a ground state. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses measurement-based feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.</description>

      <title>On the mathematical description of combined PMD PDL effects in optical communications and how their induced impairments can be minimized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07855v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper it is shown that the correct mathematical framework of combined polarization mode dispersion and polarization dependent losses (combined PMD-PDL effects or impairments) in optical fibers is the irreducible spinor representation of the extended Lorentz Group. Combined PMD-PDL effects are shown to be formally identical to Lorentz Transformations acting on spin 1/2 zero mass particles. Since there are two different irreducible spinor representations of the restricted Lorentz Group, there must also exist two kinds of states of polarizations (SOPs) that are relevant in the description of PMD-PDL effects. The optical process that allows to convert one kind into the other is identified as optical phase conjugation. Optical phase conjugation plays the same role as the time inversion operator in the Lorentz Group representation theory. A practical and extremely important example of utility of these ideas, a technique that significantly reduces the PMD-PDL induced impairments, is presented. This technique allows to cancel the PDL part of the combined PMD-PDL impairments in a very simple and straightforward way.</description>

Abstract: This letter establishes a Floquet engineering framework in which coherent high frequency light with a time dependent amplitude can be used to parametrically excite and amplify THz plasmons, mirror plasmonic wave packets in time, generate momemtum-gapped plasmonic band structures, entangled plasmon pairs, and THz radiation in two dimensional Dirac systems. Our results show how low frequency plasmons can be coherently excited and manipulated without the need for THz light.</description>

      <title>Comparison between InAs-based and GaSb-based Interband cascade lasers with hybrid superlattice plasmon-enhanced claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06525</link>

Abstract: We compare InAs-based and GaSb-based interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with the same 12 stages active region designed to emit at a wavelength of 4.6 {\mu}m. They employ a hybrid cladding architecture with the same geometry and inner claddings consisting of InAs/AlSb superlattices but different outer claddings: The InAs-based ICL employs plasmon enhanced n-type doped InAs layers while the GaSb-based ICL employs plasmon-enhanced n-type doped InAs_0.915 Sb_0.085 claddings lattice matched to GaSb. Due to the lower refractive index of n+-InAsSb (n=2.88) compared to n+-InAs (n=3.10) and higher refractive index of separate confinement layers, the GaSb-based ICL shows a 3.8 % higher optical mode confinement in the active region compared to the InAs-based ICL. Experimentally, the GaSb-based ICL shows a 17.3 % lower threshold current density in pulsed operation at room temperature. Also presented is the influence of geometry and doping variation on confinement factors and calculated free carrier absorption losses in the GaSb-based ICL.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Controlled Chiral Transport</title>

Abstract: Handedness-selective chiral transport is an intriguing phenomenon that not only holds significant importance for fundamental research, but it also carries application prospects in fields such as optical communications and sensing. Currently, on-chip chiral transport devices are static, unable to modulate the output modes based on the input modes. This limits both device functionality reconfiguration and information transmission capacity. Here, we propose to use the incident polarization diversity to control the Hamiltonian evolution path, achieving polarization-dependent chiral transport. By mapping the evolution path of TE and TM polarizations onto elaborately engineered double-coupled waveguides, we experimentally demonstrate that different polarizations yield controllable modal outputs. This work combines Multiple-Input Multiple-Output and polarization diversity concepts with chiral transport, and challenges the prevailing notion that the modal outputs are fixed to specific modes in chiral transport, thereby opening pathways for the development of on-chip reconfigurable and high-capacity handedness-selective devices.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Spatiotemporal Multi-Event Reconstruction for Delay Line Detectors</title>

Abstract: Accurate observation of two or more particles within a very narrow time window has always been a challenge in modern physics. It creates the possibility of correlation experiments, such as the ground-breaking Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiment, leading to new physical insights. For low-energy electrons, one possibility is to use a microchannel plate with subsequent delay lines for the readout of the incident particle hits, a setup called a Delay Line Detector. The spatial and temporal coordinates of more than one particle can be fully reconstructed outside a region called the dead radius. For interesting events, where two electrons are close in space and time, the determination of the individual positions of the electrons requires elaborate peak finding algorithms. While classical methods work well with single particle hits, they fail to identify and reconstruct events caused by multiple nearby particles. To address this challenge, we present a new spatiotemporal machine learning model to identify and reconstruct the position and time of such multi-hit particle signals. This model achieves a much better resolution for nearby particle hits compared to the classical approach, removing some of the artifacts and reducing the dead radius by half. We show that machine learning models can be effective in improving the spatiotemporal performance of delay line detectors.</description>

      <title>Minimalist and High-Quality Panoramic Imaging with PSF-aware Transformers</title>

Abstract: High-quality panoramic images with a Field of View (FoV) of 360{\deg} are essential for contemporary panoramic computer vision tasks. However, conventional imaging systems come with sophisticated lens designs and heavy optical components. This disqualifies their usage in many mobile and wearable applications where thin and portable, minimalist imaging systems are desired. In this paper, we propose a Panoramic Computational Imaging Engine (PCIE) to achieve minimalist and high-quality panoramic imaging. With less than three spherical lenses, a Minimalist Panoramic Imaging Prototype (MPIP) is constructed based on the design of the Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL), but with low-quality imaging results due to aberrations and small image plane size. We propose two pipelines, i.e. Aberration Correction (AC) and Super-Resolution and Aberration Correction (SR&amp;AC), to solve the image quality problems of MPIP, with imaging sensors of small and large pixel size, respectively. To leverage the prior information of the optical system, we propose a Point Spread Function (PSF) representation method to produce a PSF map as an additional modality. A PSF-aware Aberration-image Recovery Transformer (PART) is designed as a universal network for the two pipelines, in which the self-attention calculation and feature extraction are guided by the PSF map. We train PART on synthetic image pairs from simulation and put forward the PALHQ dataset to fill the gap of real-world high-quality PAL images for low-level vision. A comprehensive variety of experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrates the impressive imaging results of PCIE and the effectiveness of the PSF representation. We further deliver heuristic experimental findings for minimalist and high-quality panoramic imaging. Our dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/PCIE-PART.</description>

      <title>Homotopy, Symmetry, and Non-Hermitian Band Topology</title>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian matrices are ubiquitous in the description of nature ranging from classical dissipative systems, including optical, electrical, and mechanical metamaterials, to scattering of waves and open quantum many-body systems. Seminal line-gap and point-gap classifications of non-Hermitian systems using K-theory have deepened the understanding of many physical phenomena. However, ample systems remain beyond this description; reference points and lines do not in general distinguish whether multiple non-Hermitian bands exhibit intriguing exceptional points, spectral braids and crossings. To address this we consider two different notions: non-Hermitian band gaps and separation gaps that crucially encompass a broad class of multi-band scenarios, enabling the description of generic band structures with symmetries. With these concepts, we provide a unified and comprehensive classification of both gapped and nodal systems in the presence of physically relevant parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) and pseudo-Hermitian symmetries using homotopy theory. This uncovers new stable topology stemming from both eigenvalues and wave functions, and remarkably also implies distinct fragile topological phases. In particular, we reveal different Abelian and non-Abelian phases in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, described by frame and braid topology. The corresponding invariants are robust to symmetry-preserving perturbations that do not induce (exceptional) degeneracy, and they also predict the deformation rules of nodal phases. We further demonstrate that spontaneous $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking is captured by Chern-Euler and Chern-Stiefel-Whitney descriptions, a fingerprint of unprecedented non-Hermitian topology previously overlooked. These results open the door for theoretical and experimental exploration of a rich variety of novel topological phenomena in a wide range of physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Design principles of nonlinear optical materials for Terahertz lasers</title>

Abstract: We have investigated both inter-band and intra-band second order nonlinear optical conductivity based on the velocity correlation formalism and the spectral expansion technique. We propose a scenario in which the second order intra-band process is nonzero while the inter-band process is zero. This occurs for a band structure with momentum asymmetry in the Brillouin zone. Very low-energy photons are blocked by the Pauli exclusion principle from participating in the inter-band process; however, they are permitted to participate in the intra-band process, with the band smeared by some impurity scattering. We establish a connection between the inter-band nonlinear optical conductivity in the velocity gauge and the shift vector in the length gauge for a two-band model. Using a quasiclassical kinetic approach, we demonstrate the importance of intra-band transitions in high harmonic generations for the single tilted Dirac cone model and hexagonal warping model. We confirm that the Kramers-Kronig relations break down for the limit case of ($\omega$, $-\omega$) in the nonlinear optical conductivity. Finally, we calculate the superconducting transition temperature of NbN and the dielectric function of AlN, and the resistance of the NbN/AlN junction. The natural non-linearity of the Josephson junction brings a Josephson plasma with frequency in the Terahertz region.</description>
