      <title>How to compute density fluctuations at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard definition of particle number fluctuations based on point-like particles neglects the excluded volume effect. This leads to a large and systematic finite-size scaling and an unphysical surface term in the isothermal compressibility. We correct these errors by introducing a modified pair distribution function which takes account of the finite size of the particles. For the hard sphere fluid in one-dimension, we show that the compressibility is strictly size-independent and we reproduce this result from the number fluctuations calculated with the new theory. In general, the present method eliminates the leading finite-size effect, which makes it possible to compute density fluctuations accurately in very small sampling volumes, comparable to the single particle size. These findings open the way for obtaining local response functions from fluctuation theory at the nanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Committor guided estimates of molecular transition rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability that a configuration of a physical system reacts, or transitions from one metastable state to another, is quantified by the committor function. This function contains richly detailed mechanistic information about transition pathways, but a full parameterization of the committor requires building representing a high-dimensional function, a generically challenging task. Recent efforts to leverage neural networks as a means to solve high-dimensional partial differential equations, often called "physics-informed" machine learning, have brought the committor into computational reach. Here, we build on the semigroup approach to learning the committor and assess its utility for predicting dynamical quantities such as transition rates. We show that a careful reframing of the objective function and improved adaptive sampling strategies provide highly accurate representations of the committor. Furthermore, by directly applying the Hill relation, we show that these committors provide accurate transition rates for molecular system.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Properties of Gauge Theories from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16235v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between higher-form symmetries and entanglement properties in discrete lattice gauge theories, which can exhibit both topologically ordered phases and higher-form symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Our study centers on generalizing the Fradkin-Shenker model, where the Gauss law constraint can be either emergent or exact. The phase diagram includes a topologically ordered phase and a non-trivial SPT phase protected by a 1-form and a 0-form symmetry. We obtain the following key findings: First, the entanglement properties depend on whether the 1-form symmetries and the Gauss law are exact or emergent. For the emergent Gauss law, the entanglement spectrum (ES) of the non-trivial SPT phase exhibits degeneracies, which are robust at low energies against weak perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry. When the Gauss law and the 1-form symmetry are both exact, the ES degeneracy is extensive. This extensive degeneracy is fragile and can be removed completely by infinitesimal perturbations that explicitly break the exact 1-form symmetry while keeping the Gauss law exact. Second, we consider the ES in the topologically ordered phase where 1-form symmetries are spontaneously broken. In contrast to the ES of the non-trivial SPT phase, we find that spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking removes "half" of the ES levels, leading to a non-degenerate ES in the topologically ordered phase in general. Third, we derive a connection between spontaneous higher-form symmetry breaking and the topological entanglement entropy (TEE). Using this relation, we investigate the entanglement entropy that can be distilled in the deconfined phase of the original Fradkin-Shenker model using gauge-invariant measurements. We show that the TEE is robust against the measurement when the 1-form symmetry is emergent but fragile when the 1-form symmetry is exact.</description>

      <title>Theory of metastable states in many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical theory of metastable pure states in closed many-body quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Given a Hamiltonian, a pure state is defined to be metastable when all sufficiently local operators either stabilize the state, or raise its average energy. We prove that short-range entangled metastable states are necessarily eigenstates (scars) of a perturbatively close Hamiltonian. Given any metastable eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, in the presence of perturbations, we prove the presence of prethermal behavior: local correlation functions decay at a rate bounded by a time scale nonperturbatively long in the inverse metastability radius, rather than Fermi's Golden Rule. Inspired by this general theory, we prove that the lifetime of the false vacuum in certain $d$-dimensional quantum models grows at least as fast as $\exp(\epsilon^{-d} \log^{-3} \epsilon^{-1} )$, where $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ is the relative energy density of the false vacuum; up to logarithms, this lower bound matches, for the first time, explicit calculations using quantum field theory. We identify metastable states at finite energy density in the PXP model, along with exponentially many metastable states in "helical" spin chains and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our inherently quantum formalism reveals precise connections between many problems, including prethermalization, robust quantum scars, and quantum nucleation theory, and applies to systems without known semiclassical and/or field theoretic limits.</description>

      <title>Lindbladian reverse engineering for general non-equilibrium steady states: A scalable null-space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of open system dynamics is of paramount importance both from its fundamental aspects as well as from its potential applications in quantum technologies. In the simpler and most commonly studied case, the dynamics of the system can be described by a Lindblad master equation. However, identifying the Lindbladian that leads to general non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) is usually a non-trivial and challenging task. Here we introduce a method for reconstructing the corresponding Lindbaldian master equation given any target NESS, i.e., a Lindbladian Reverse Engineering ($\mathcal{L}$RE) approach. The method maps the reconstruction task to a simple linear problem. Specifically, to the diagonalization of a correlation matrix whose elements are NESS observables and whose size scales linearly (at most quadratically) with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian (Lindblad jump operator) ansatz. The kernel (null-space) of the correlation matrix corresponds to Lindbladian solutions. Moreover, the map defines an iff condition for $\mathcal{L}$RE, which works as both a necessary and a sufficient condition; thus, it not only defines, if possible, Lindbaldian evolutions leading to the target NESS, but also determines the feasibility of such evolutions in a proposed setup. We illustrate the method in different systems, ranging from bosonic Gaussian to dissipative-driven collective spins. We also discuss non-Markovian effects and possible forms to recover Markovianity in the reconstructed Lindbaldian.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant phase transitions induced by localization of zero-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common wisdom dictates that physical systems become less ordered when heated to higher temperature. However, several systems display the opposite phenomenon and move to a more ordered state upon heating, e.g. at low temperature piezoelectric quartz is paraelectric and it only becomes piezoelectric when heated to sufficiently high temperature. The presence, or better, the re-entrance of unordered phases at low temperature is more prevalent than one might think. Although specific models have been developed to understand the phenomenon in specific systems, a universal explanation is lacking. Here we propose a universal simple microscopic theory which predicts the existence of two critical temperatures in inhomogeneous systems, where the lower one marks the re-entrance into the less ordered phase. We show that the re-entrant phase transition is caused by disorder-induced spatial localization of the zero-mode on a finite, i.e. sub-extensive, region of the system. Specifically, this trapping of the zero-mode disconnects the fluctuations of the order parameter in distant regions of the system, thus triggering the loss of long-range order and the re-entrance into the disordered phase. This makes the phenomenon quite universal and robust to the underlying details of the model, and explains its ubiquitous observation.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and geometric entanglement entropy of one-dimensional Floquet topological matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of quantum states could offer indispensable insights for characterizing the topological properties, phase transitions and entanglement nature of many-body systems. In this work, we reveal the quantum geometry and the associated entanglement entropy (EE) of Floquet topological states in one-dimensional periodically driven systems. The quantum metric tensors of Floquet states are found to show non-analytic signatures at topological phase transition points. Away from the transition points, the bipartite geometric EE of Floquet states exhibits an area-law scaling vs the system size, which holds for a Floquet band at any filling fractions. For a uniformly filled Floquet band, the EE further becomes purely quantum geometric. At phase transition points, the geometric EE scales logarithmically with the system size and displays cusps in the nearby parameter ranges. These discoveries are demonstrated by investigating typical Floquet models including periodically driven spin chains, Floquet topological insulators and superconductors. Our findings uncover the rich quantum geometries of Floquet states, unveiling the geometric origin of EE for gapped Floquet topological phases, and introducing information-theoretic means of depicting topological transitions in Floquet systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness and classical proxy of entanglement in variants of quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walk (QW) utilizes its internal quantum states to decide the displacement, thereby introducing single-particle entanglement between the internal and positional degrees of freedom. By simulating three variants of QW with the conventional, symmetric, and split-step translation operators with or without classical randomness in the coin operator, we show the entanglement is robust against both time- and spatially- dependent randomness, which can cause localization transitions of QW. We propose a classical quantity call overlap, which literally measures the overlap between the probability distributions of the internal states, as a proxy of entanglement. The overlap captures the inverse behavior of the entanglement entropy in most cases, which can be explained by analyzing the structure of the total wave function of the walker. We test the limitation of the classical proxy by constructing a special case with high population imbalance between the internal states to blind the overlap. Possible implications and experimental measurements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and analytic results for one-dimensional strongly interacting spinor gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of quantum physics's fundamental, but largely unsolved, problems is the computation of the correlation functions in many-body systems. In this paper we address this problem in the case of one-dimensional spinor gases with repulsive contact interactions in the presence of a confining potential. We take advantage of the fact that in the strong coupling limit, the wavefunction factorizes with the charge degrees of freedom expressed as a Slater determinant of spinless fermions and the spin sector described by a spin chain of Sutherland type with exchange coefficients that depend only on the trapping potential. This factorization is also present in the expressions for the correlation functions. Still, analytical and numerical investigations were hindered by the fact that the local exchange coefficients and the charge component of the correlators are expressed as $N-1$ multidimensional integrals, with $N$ the number of particles, which are notoriously hard to compute using conventional methods. We introduce a new approach to calculating these integrals that is extremely simple, scales polynomially with the number of particles, and is several orders of magnitude faster than the previous methods reported in the literature. This allows us to investigate the static and dynamic properties, temperature dependence, and nonequilibrium dynamics for systems with larger number of particles than previously considered and discover new phenomena. We show that, contrary to natural expectations, the momentum distribution of strongly interacting trapped spinor gases becomes narrower as we increase the temperature and derive simple determinant representations for the correlators in the spin incoherent regime valid for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proposed as an elegant symmetry relating bosons and fermions, spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) has been actively pursued in both particle physics and emergent phenomena in quantum critical points (QCP) of topological quantum materials. However, how SUSY casts the light on nonequilibrium dynamics remains open. In this letter, we investigate the Kibble-Zurek dynamics across a QCP with emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY between the Dirac semimetal and a superconductor through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation. The scaling behaviors in the whole driven process are uncovered to satisfy the full finite-time scaling (FTS) forms. More crucially, we demonstrate that the emergent SUSY manifests in the intimate relation between the FTS behaviors of fermionic and bosonic observables, namely the fermions and bosons acquire the identical anomalous dimensions. Our work not only brings a fundamental new ingredient into the critical theory with SUSY, but also provide the theoretical guidance to experimental detect of QCP with emergent SUSY from the perspectives of Kibble-Zurek mechanism and FTS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant quantum many-body systems via spectra of momentum-resolved operator propagator on infinite systems. Momentum dependence gives insight into decay of correlation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different correlation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the kicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular random matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated resonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime with a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe a huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions. An exact expression for the singular values of the operator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a special point.</description>

Abstract: In a previous work [A simplified Parisi Ansatz, Franchini, S., Commun. Theor. Phys., 73, 055601 (2021)] we introduced a simple method to compute the Random Overlap Structure of Aizenmann, Simm and Stars and the full-RSB Parisi formula for the Sherrington-Kirckpatrick Model without using replica theory. The method consists in partitioning the system into smaller sub-systems that we call layers, and iterate the Bayes rule. A central ansatz in our derivation was that these layers could be approximated by Random Energy Models of the Derrida type. In this paper we analyze the properties of the interface in detail, and show the equivalence with the Random Energy Model at any temperature.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Debate Between Boltzmann and Gibbs Entropy: Relative Energy Window Eliminates Thermodynamic Inconsistencies and Allows Negative Absolute Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small systems consisting of a few particles are increasingly technologically relevant. In such systems, an intense debate in microcanonical statistical mechanics has been about the correctness of Boltzmann's surface entropy versus Gibbs' volume entropy. Both entropies have shortcomings -- while Boltzmann entropy predicts unphysical negative/infinite absolute temperatures for small systems with unbounded energy, Gibbs entropy entirely disallows negative absolute temperatures, in disagreement with experiments. We consider a relative energy window, motivated by the Heisenberg energy-time uncertainty principle and eigenstate thermalization in quantum mechanics. The proposed entropy ensures positive, finite temperatures for systems without a maximum limit on their energy and allows negative absolute temperatures in bounded energy systems, e.g., with population inversion. It also closely matches canonical ensemble predictions for prototypical systems, thus correctly describing the zero-point energy of an isolated quantum harmonic oscillator. Overall, we enable accurate thermodynamic models for isolated systems with few degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for a coherent phenomenon of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is known that Hamiltonian systems may undergo a phenomenon of condensation akin to Bose-Einstein condensation, not all the manifestations of this phenomenon have been uncovered yet. In this work we present a novel form of condensation in conservative Hamiltonian systems that stands out due to its evolution through highly coherent states. The result is based on a deterministic approach to obtain exact explicit solutions representing the dynamical formation of condensates in finite time. We reveal a dual-cascade behavior during the process, featuring inverse and direct transfer of conserved quantities across the spectrum. The direct cascade yields the excitation of arbitrarily high modes in finite time, being associated with the formation of a small-scale coherent structure. We provide a fully analytic description of the processes involved.</description>

      <title>Universal Non-equilibrium Response Theory Beyond Steady States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuation-dissipation relations elucidate the response of near-equilibrium systems to environmental changes, with recent advances extending response theory to non-equilibrium steady states. However, a general response theory for systems evolving far from steady states has remained elusive. Using information geometry of stochastic trajectory probabilities, we derive universal thermodynamic bounds on both linear and nonlinear responses of Markov systems to environmental changes, applicable across all non-equilibrium regimes. This theory establishes a new paradigm in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, offering a unified perspective on the responsiveness of non-stationary systems to external control and environmental changes. Applicable to systems ranging from biological sensory processes to engineered responsive materials, our framework paves the way for understanding and designing complex responsiveness in far-from-equilibrium stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Large deviations in statistics of the local time and occupation time for a run and tumble particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the statistics of the local time $\mathcal{T} = \int_0^T \delta(x(t)) dt$ that a run and tumble particle (RTP) $x(t)$ in one dimension spends at the origin, with or without an external drift. By relating the local time to the number of times the RTP crosses the origin, we find that the local time distribution $P(\mathcal{T})$ satisfies the large deviation principle $P(\mathcal{T}) \sim \, e^{-T \, I(\mathcal{T} / T)} $ in the large observation time limit $T \to \infty$. Remarkably, we find that in presence of drift the rate function $I(\rho)$ is nonanalytic: We interpret its singularity as dynamical phase transitions of first order. We then extend these results by studying the statistics of the amount of time $\mathcal{R}$ that the RTP spends inside a finite interval (i.e., the occupation time), with qualitatively similar results. In particular, this yields the long-time decay rate of the probability $P(\mathcal{R} = T)$ that the particle does not exit the interval up to time $T$. We find that the conditional endpoint distribution exhibits an interesting change of behavior from unimodal to bimodal as a function of the size of the interval. To study the occupation time statistics, we extend the Donsker-Varadhan large-deviation formalism to the case of RTPs, for general dynamical observables and possibly in the presence of an external potential.</description>

      <title>From high-dimensional committors to reactive insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition path theory (TPT) offers a powerful formalism for extracting the rate and mechanism of rare dynamical transitions between metastable states. Most applications of TPT either focus on systems with modestly sized state spaces or use collective variables to try to tame the curse of dimensionality. Increasingly, expressive function approximators like neural networks and tensor networks have shown promise in computing the central object of TPT, the committor function, even in very high dimensional systems. That progress prompts our consideration of how one could use such a high dimensional function to extract mechanistic insight. Here, we present and illustrate a straightforward but powerful way to track how individual dynamical coordinates evolve during a reactive event. The strategy, which involves marginalizing the reactive ensemble, naturally captures the evolution of the dynamical coordinate's distribution, not just its mean reactive behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the significance of non-extensive terms in Massieu functions. We demonstrate that these terms, of order $\ln N$, where $N$ represents the number of elements, can be expressed in relation to thermodynamic fluctuations. We focus on systems large enough to mitigate finite size effects, concentrating on the $O(\ln N)$ difference present in both ideal and non-ideal scenarios. The analytical verification in ideal cases and numerical validation in non-ideal scenarios corroborate our results. The examples used are hard sphere and hard disk fluids and a one-dimensional spin lattice, emphasizing the applicability of the results across different classes of systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on Google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transition between topological phases in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model composed of springs and masses in which the intracellular quasi-periodic disorder modulates the spring constants. We observe the presence of a topological Anderson insulating (TAI) phase within a specific range of quasi-periodic modulation strength and calculate the phase transition boundary analytically. We examine the localization properties of the normal modes using the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of eigenstates of the dynamical matrix, and the corresponding fractal dimension associated with quasiperiodic modulation. We also examine the stability of the TAI phase across a range of modulation strengths and comments on the presence of mobility edge that separate localized modes from non-localized ones. We demonstrate the fact that special analytical techniques are needed to compute an exact expression for mobility edges in such scenario.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approaching the challenge to understand fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with understanding the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss first and second-order phase transitions and emerging new states including long-lived metastable states. We also discuss transitions between metastable states, chemical reactions and their products. These examples show that different values of FPCs would disable these transitions, and new phases as a result of these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling transitions which give rise to new states, act to increase the phase space and entropy.</description>

Abstract: We study conservation laws of a general class of quantum many-body systems subjected to an external time dependent quasi-periodic driving. {When the frequency of the driving is large enough or the strength of the driving is small enough, we prove a Nekhoroshev-type stability result: we show that the system exhibits a prethermal state for stretched exponentially long times in the perturbative parameter}. Moreover, we prove the quasi-conservation of the constants of motion of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and we analyze their physical meaning in examples of relevance to condensed matter and statistical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a dissipative phase transition in a driven nonlinear quantum oscillator in which a discrete time-translation symmetry is spontaneously broken in two different ways. The corresponding regimes display either discrete or incommensurate time-crystal order, which we analyze numerically and analytically beyond the classical limit addressing observable dynamics, phenomenology in different (laboratory and rotating) frames, Liouvillian spectral features, and quantum fluctuations. Via an effective semiclassical description, we show that phase diffusion dominates in the incommensurate time crystal (or continuous time crystal in the rotating frame), which manifests as a band of eigenmodes with a lifetime growing linearly with the mean-field excitation number. Instead, in the discrete time crystal phase, the leading fluctuation process corresponds to quantum activation with a single mode that has an exponentially growing lifetime. Interestingly, the transition between these two regimes manifests itself already in the quantum regime as a spectral singularity, namely as an exceptional point mediating between phase diffusion and quantum activation. Finally, we discuss this transition between different time-crystal orders in the context of synchronization phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by $$ \mathscr{L}_{\epsilon}f= {b} \cdot \nabla f + \epsilon \Delta f $$ for some smooth vector field $ b\colon \mathbb R^d \to\mathbb R^d$ and a small parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$. Consider the initial-valued problem $$ \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;\partial_ t u_\epsilon = \mathscr L_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &amp;u_\epsilon (0, \cdot) = u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. $$ for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Denote by $\mathcal M_0$ the set of critical points of $b$ which are stable stationary points for the ODE $\dot x (t) = b (x(t))$. Under the hypothesis that $\mathcal M_0$ is finite and $ b = -(\nabla U + \ell)$, where $ \ell$ is a divergence-free field orthogonal to $\nabla U$, the main result of this article states that there exist a time-scale $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon$, $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to \infty$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, and a Markov semigroup $\{p_t : t\ge 0\}$ defined on $\mathcal M_0$ such that $$ \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} u_\epsilon (t\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon, x)
  =\sum_{m'\in \mathcal M_0} p_t(m, m')\, u_0( m'), $$ for all $t&gt;0$ and $ x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the ODE $\dot{x}(t)= b( x(t))$. The time scale $\theta^{(1)}$ is critical in the sense that, for all time scale $\varrho_\epsilon$ such that $\varrho_\epsilon \to \infty$, $\varrho_\epsilon/\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to 0$, $$ \lim_{\epsilon\to 0} u_\epsilon (\varrho_\epsilon, x)=u_0(m) $$ for all $x \in \mathcal D(m)$. Namely, $\theta_\epsilon^{(1)}$ is the first scale at which the solution to the initial-valued problem starts to change. In a companion paper [Landim, Lee, Seo, forthcoming] we extend this result finding all critical time-scales at which the solution $u_\epsilon$ evolves smoothly in time and we show that the solution $u_\epsilon$ is expressed in terms of the semigroup of some Markov chain taking values in sets formed by unions of critical points of $b$.</description>

      <title>Effects of phylogeny on coexistence in model communities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Species' interactions are shaped by their traits. Thus, we expect traits -- in particular, trait (dis)similarity -- to play a central role in determining whether a particular set of species coexists. Traits are, in turn, the outcome of an eco-evolutionary process summarized by a phylogenetic tree. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree associated with a set of species should carry information about the dynamics and assembly properties of the community. Many studies have highlighted the potentially complex ways in which this phylogenetic information is translated into species' ecological properties. However, much less emphasis has been placed on developing clear, quantitative expectations for community properties under a particular hypothesis. To address this gap, we couple a simple model of trait evolution on a phylogenetic tree with Lotka-Volterra community dynamics. This allows us to derive properties of a community of coexisting species as a function of the number of traits, tree topology and the size of the species pool. Our analysis highlights how phylogenies, through traits, affect the coexistence of a set of species. Together, these results provide much-needed baseline expectations for the ways in which evolutionary history, summarized by phylogeny, is reflected in the size and structure of ecological communities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel quantum computing approach to solve the real-world problem of optimizing transportation in bustling Kathmandu city. The transportation system in Kathmandu is chaotic, with no central authority controlling the transportation. We leverage this chaotic feature in our quantum optimization procedure. The quantum chaos theory's Wigner-Dyson distribution surfaced as the most effective bus spacing distribution for a bus driver to maximize their profit. We investigate the statistical properties of the buses with real-time GPS bus location data and optimize bus spacing and interval distribution around the 27 km circular ring road in Kathmandu. Using tools like quantum simulation, eigenvalue distributions, and output wave function analysis, we show that such optimal bus spacing distribution could be achieved.</description>

Abstract: We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the (longitudinal) thermodynamic and structural characteristics of single-file confined square-well and square-shoulder disks by employing a mapping technique that transforms the original system into a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive rods. Leveraging standard statistical-mechanical techniques, exact results are derived for key properties, including the equation of state, internal energy, radial distribution function, and structure factor. The asymptotic behavior of the radial distribution function is explored, revealing structural changes in the spatial correlations. Additionally, exact analytical expressions for the second virial coefficient are presented. The theoretical results for the thermodynamic and structural properties are validated by our Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the transverse and longitudinal properties of hard disks confined in narrow channels. Employing an exact mapping of the system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse, nonadditive mixture of hard rods with equal chemical potentials, we compute various thermodynamic properties, including the transverse and longitudinal equations of state, along with their behaviors at both low and high densities. Structural properties are analyzed using the two-body correlation function and the radial distribution function, tailored for the highly anisotropic geometry of this system.

      <title>Hawking evaporation and the Landauer Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Hawking black-hole evaporation saturates the Landauer Principle of information thermodynamics. Our result implies that information loss experienced by a black hole during Hawking evaporation takes place as efficiently as possible. We also extend the analysis to the case of Barrow entropy as a phenomenological realization of a fractal event horizon, where the Landauer Principle informs amongst different options for the black hole temperature. To our knowledge, this work is the first identification of the two results as expressions of the same process.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Cage Evolution in Quasi-two-dimensional Colloidal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally explore the morphological evolution of cages in quasi-two-dimensional suspensions of colloidal fluids, uncovering a complex dynamic restructuring in the fluid. Although cages display isotropic evolution in the laboratory frame, we observe a striking anisotropy when analyzed in the displacement frame of the caged particles. Moreover, our findings reveal that particles in specific but distinct regions of the cage predominantly contribute to either its persistence or relaxation. Thus, our study provides a coarse-grained microscopic picture of the structural relaxation of these fluids through cage evolution, which has broader implications for the flow and phase behavior of complex fluids in confined geometry.</description>

      <title>How to escape atypical regions in the symmetric binary perceptron: a journey through connected-solutions states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the binary symmetric perceptron model, and in particular its atypical solutions. While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by isolated configurations, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical measure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a strong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it to Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected states with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their initialization only for $\kappa&gt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$ ($\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}\sim \sqrt{0.91\log(N)}$ for $\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the dimension of the problem). For $\kappa&lt;\kappa_{\rm no-mem.\, state}$, we show that decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations profile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations that we label as the nested Markov chain.</description>
