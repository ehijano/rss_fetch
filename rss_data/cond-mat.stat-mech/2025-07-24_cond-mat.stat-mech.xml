      <title>Exact solution of asymmetric gelation between three walks on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find and analyse the exact solution of a model of three different
  polymers with asymmetric contact interactions in two dimensions, modelling a
  scenario where there are different types of polymers involved. In particular, we find
  the generating function of three directed osculating walks in star
  configurations on the square lattice with two interaction Boltzmann weights,
  so that there is one type of contact interaction between the top pair of walks and a
  different interaction between the bottom pair of walks. These osculating
  stars are found to be the most amenable to exact solution using functional
  equation techniques in comparison to the symmetric case where three friendly
  walks in watermelon configurations were successfully solved with the same
  techniques. We elucidate the phase diagram, which has four phases, and find
  the order of all the phase transitions between them. We also calculate the
  entropic exponents in each phase.</description>

      <title>Restricted Boltzmann machine as a probabilistic Enigma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a symmetric encryption scheme based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines that functions as a probabilistic Enigma device, encoding information in the marginal distributions of visible states while utilizing bias permutations as cryptographic keys. Theoretical analysis reveals significant advantages including factorial key space growth through permutation matrices, excellent diffusion properties, and computational complexity rooted in sharp P-complete problems that resist quantum attacks. Compatible with emerging probabilistic computing hardware, the scheme establishes an asymmetric computational barrier where legitimate users decrypt efficiently while adversaries face exponential costs. This framework unlocks probabilistic computers' potential for cryptographic systems, offering an emerging encryption paradigm between classical and quantum regimes for post-quantum security.</description>

      <title>Symmetry re-breaking in an effective theory of quantum coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple theory accounting for two central observations in a recent experiment on quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator [T. Manovitz et al., Nature 638, 86 (2025)]: an apparent speeding up of the coarsening process as the phase transition is approached; and persistent oscillations of the order parameter after quenches within the ordered phase. Our theory, based on the Hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion in the classical limit of the quantum model, finds a speeding up already deep within the ordered phase, with subsequent slowing down as the domain wall tension vanishes upon approaching the critical line. Further, the oscillations are captured within a mean-field treatment of the order parameter field. For quenches within the ordered phase, small spatially-varying fluctuations in the initial mean-field lead to a remarkable long-time effect, wherein the system dynamically destroys its long-range order and has to coarsen to re-establish it. We term this phenomenon symmetry re-breaking, as the resulting late-time magnetization can have a sign opposite to the initial magnetization.</description>

      <title>Exact results for active particle models: from long-range interactions to first-passage properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Current Fluctuations in Periodic TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate current fluctuations in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on a ring of size $N$ with $p$ particles. By deforming the Markov generator with a parameter $\gamma$, we analyze the tilted operator governing current statistics using coordinate Bethe ansatz techniques. We derive implicit expressions for the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), i.e. the largest eigenvalue, and the spectral gap in terms of Bethe roots, exploiting the geometric structure of Cassini ovals.
  In the thermodynamic limit, at fixed particle density, a dynamical phase transition emerges between regimes distinguished by the sign of $\gamma$. For positive deformation $\gamma$, the SCGF exhibits ballistic scaling, growing linearly with system size $N$. For negative $\gamma$, the SCGF converges to a universal constant, highlighting distinct fluctuation regimes.
  Correspondingly, the spectral gap, controlling relaxation times, shows qualitatively different finite-size scaling: it closes as $O(N^{-1})$ for $\gamma&gt;0$ reflecting slow relaxation, but it decreases exponentially for $\gamma&lt;0$ indicating rapid convergence. These results provide insight into the metastability and relaxation dynamics in driven interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning of Gibbs states for many-body Hamiltonians with applications to Quantum Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms: Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT (NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a 30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.</description>

      <title>Many-body delocalization with a two-dimensional 70-qubit superconducting quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems with sufficiently strong disorder can exhibit a non-equilibrium phenomenon, known as the many-body localization (MBL), which is distinct from conventional thermalization. While the MBL regime has been extensively studied in one dimension, its existence in higher dimensions remains elusive, challenged by the avalanche instability. Here, using a 70-qubit two-dimensional (2D) superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally explore the robustness of the MBL regime in controlled finite-size 2D systems. We observe that the decay of imbalance becomes more pronounced with increasing system sizes, scaling up from 21, 42 to 70 qubits, with a relatively large disorder strength, and for the first time, provide an evidence for the many-body delocalization in 2D disordered systems. Our experimental results are consistent with the avalanche theory that predicts the instability of MBL regime beyond one spatial dimension. This work establishes a scalable platform for probing high-dimensional non-equilibrium phases of matter and their finite-size effects using superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.</description>

      <title>Rigidity control of general origami structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origami, the traditional paper-folding art, has inspired the modern design of numerous flexible structures in science and engineering. In particular, origami structures with different physical properties have been studied and utilized for various applications. More recently, several deterministic and stochastic approaches have been developed for controlling the rigidity or softness of the Miura-ori structures. However, the rigidity control of other origami structures is much less understood. In this work, we study the rigidity control of general origami structures via enforcing or relaxing the planarity condition of their polygonal facets. Specifically, by performing numerical simulations on a large variety of origami structures with different facet selection rules, we systematically analyze how the geometry and topology of different origami structures affect their degrees of freedom (DOF). We also propose a hypergeometric model based on the selection process to derive theoretical bounds for the probabilistic properties of the rigidity change, which allows us to identify key origami structural variables that theoretically govern the DOF evolution and thereby the critical rigidity percolation transition in general origami structures. Moreover, we develop a simple unified model that describes the relationship between the critical percolation density, the origami facet geometry, and the facet selection rules, which enables efficient prediction of the critical transition density for high-resolution origami structures. Altogether, our work highlights the intricate similarities and differences in the rigidity control of general origami structures, shedding light on the design of flexible mechanical metamaterials for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound in dense simple liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The speed of sound of simple dense fluids is shown to exhibit a pronounced freezing temperature scaling of the form $c_{\rm s}/v_{\rm T}\simeq \sqrt{\gamma} +\alpha (T_{\rm fr}/T)^{\beta}$, where $c_s$ is the speed of sound, $v_{\rm T}$ is the characteristic thermal velocity, $\gamma$ is the ideal gas heat capacity ratio, $T$ is the temperature, $T_{\rm fr}$ is the freezing temperature, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are dimensionless parameters. For the Lennard-Jones fluid we get $\gamma=5/3$, $\alpha\simeq 7$ with a weak temperature dependence, and $\beta = 1/3$. Similar scaling works in several real liquids, such as argon, krypton, xenon, nitrogen, and methane. In this case, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are substance-dependent fitting parameters. A comparison between the prediction of this freezing temperature scaling and a recent experimental measurement of the speed of sound in methane under conditions of planetary interiors is presented and discussed. The results provide a simple practical tool to estimate the speed of sound in regimes where no experimental data are yet available.</description>

      <title>A resource theoretical unification of Mpemba effects: classical and quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect originally referred to the observation that, under certain thermalizing dynamics, initially hotter samples can cool faster than colder ones. This effect has since been generalized to other anomalous relaxation behaviors even beyond classical domains, such as symmetry restoration in quantum systems. This work demonstrates that resource theories, widely employed in information theory, provide a unified organizing principle to frame Mpemba physics. We show how the conventional thermal Mpemba effect arises naturally from the resource theory of athermality, while its symmetry-restoring counterpart is fully captured by the resource theories of asymmetry. Leveraging the framework of modes of asymmetry, we demonstrate that the Mpemba effect due to symmetry restoration is governed by the initial overlap with the slowest symmetry-restoring mode -- mirroring the role of the slowest Liouvillian eigenmode in thermal Mpemba dynamics. Through this resource-theoretical formalism, we uncover the connection between these seemingly disparate effects and show that the dynamics of thermalization naturally splits into a symmetry-respecting and a symmetry-breaking term.</description>

      <title>How animal movement influences wildlife-vehicle collision risk: a mathematical framework for range-resident species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) threaten both biodiversity and human safety worldwide. Despite empirical efforts to characterize the major determinants of WVC risk and optimize mitigation strategies, we still lack a theoretical framework linking traffic, landscape, and individual movement features to collision risk. Here, we introduce such a framework by leveraging recent advances in movement ecology and reaction-diffusion stochastic processes with partially absorbing boundaries. Focusing on range-resident terrestrial mammals -- responsible for most fatal WVCs -- we model interactions with a single linear road and derive exact expressions for key survival statistics, including mean collision time and road-induced lifespan reduction. These quantities are expressed in terms of measurable parameters, such as traffic intensity or road width, and movement parameters that can be robustly estimated from relocation data, such as home-range crossing times, home-range sizes, or distance between home-range center and road. Therefore, our work provides an effective theoretical framework integrating movement and road ecology, laying the foundation for data-driven, evidence-based strategies to mitigate WVCs and promote safer, more sustainable transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Defect-Mediated Aggregation and Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Active XY Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an ``active XY model'' that incorporates key elements of both the classical XY model and the Vicsek model to study the role of topological defects in active matter systems. This model features self-propelled particles with XY spin degrees of freedom on a lattice and introduces a self-propulsion parameter controlling the directional bias of particle motion. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that self-propulsion induces motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), where particles aggregate into clusters around topological defects with positive vortex charge. In contrast, negative charge defects tend to dissipate. We analyze the evolution of these clusters and show that their growth follows a two-stage exponential relaxation process, with characteristic time scaling as $\tau \sim L^{3}$ with the system size $L$, reminiscent of first-order phase separation in equilibrium systems. Our results highlight the important role of topological defects in phase separations and clustering behavior in active systems, bridging nonequilibrium dynamics and equilibrium theory.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the many-body Lanczos algorithm at finite size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to finite-size many-body quantum systems. Focusing on autocorrelation functions of local operators and on their infinite-time behaviour at finite size, we conjecture that in the large $n$ limit, the ratios between consecutive Lanczos coefficients should have specific scalings with the size of the lattice that we make precise and that depend on the hydrodynamic tail of the autocorrelation function. The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different models.</description>

      <title>Universality of Alpha-Relaxation in Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for effective field theories: cutoff schemes and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In effective field theories, the concept of renormalization of perturbative divergences is replaced by renormalization group concepts such as relevance and universality. Universality is related to cutoff scheme independence in renormalization. Three-dimensional scalar field theory with just the quartic coupling is universal but the less relevant sextic coupling introduces a cutoff scheme dependence, which we quantify by three independent parameters, in the two-loop order of perturbation theory. However, reasonable schemes only allow reduced ranges of those parameters, even contrasting the sharp cutoff with very smooth cutoffs. The sharp cutoff performs better. In any case, the effective field theory possesses some degree of universality even in the massive case (off criticality).</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in minimal Kitaev chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal Kitaev chains host Majorana quasiparticles, which, although not topologically protected, exhibit spatial nonlocality and hence expected to be useful for quantum information tasks. In this work, we consider two- and three-site Kitaev chains and investigate the dynamics of bipartite and multipartite entanglement by means of concurrence and geometric measure of entanglement. In two-site Kitaev chains, we find that maximally entangled states can robustly emerge, with their stability and periodicity highly controllable by the interplay between the superconducting pair potential and the onsite energies. At the finely tuned sweet spot, where Majorana quasiparticles appear, the system exhibits oscillations between separable and entangled states, whereas detuning introduces tunable valleys in the entanglement dynamics. Extending to the three-site Kitaev chain, we uncover rich bipartite and multipartite entanglement by generalizing the concepts of concurrence and geometric measure of entanglement. At the sweet spot, the Majorana quasiparticles emerging at the edges suppress concurrence between the edges, while a finite detuning is able to restore it. Depending on the initial state, the three-site Kitaev chain can dynamically generate either a maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state or an imperfect W-type state exhibiting multipartite entanglement, although a (maximally entangled) pure W state cannot be realised due to parity constraints. Our results provide a resource for generating and characterising highly entangled states in minimal Kitaev chains, with potential relevance for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>From Atoms to Dynamics: Learning the Committor Without Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Brief Communication introduces a graph-neural-network architecture built on geometric vector perceptrons to predict the committor function directly from atomic coordinates, bypassing the need for hand-crafted collective variables (CVs). The method offers atom-level interpretability, pinpointing the key atomic players in complex transitions without relying on prior assumptions. Applied across diverse molecular systems, the method accurately infers the committor function and highlights the importance of each heavy atom in the transition mechanism. It also yields precise estimates of the rate constants for the underlying processes. The proposed approach opens new avenues for understanding and modeling complex dynamics, by enabling CV-free learning and automated identification of physically meaningful reaction coordinates of complex molecular processes.</description>

      <title>Classical triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model as a free-fermion/superconductor system</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.08857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a treatment of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model (TAFIM) based on a small number of elementary ideas common to statistical and solid-state physics. The TAFIM is represented as a reduced BCS model in one space, one (imaginary) time dimension. The representation is approximate for nonzero temperature, but allows quick derivation of asymptotically exact thermodynamic functions, and the divergence of the spin-spin correlation length. The fermionic representation is exact at zero temperature. We demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional continuum of zero-temperature equilibrium macrostates characterized by satisfied bond fractions of the three different orientations, and calculate their entropy densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex fluids subjected to localized microscopic energy inputs, typical of active microrheology setups, exhibit poorly understood nonequilibrium behaviors because of the intricate self-organization of their mesoscopic constituents. In this work we show how to identify changes in the microstructural conformation of the fluid by monitoring the variance of the probe position, based on a general method grounded in the breakdown of the equipartition theorem. To illustrate our method, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of an effective model of micellar solution, and we link the different scaling regimes in the variance of the probe's position to the transitions from diffusive to jump dynamics, where the fluid intermittently relaxes the accumulated stress. This suggests stored elastic stress may be the physical mechanism behind the nonlinear friction curves recently measured in micellar solutions, pointing at a mechanism for the observed multi-step rheology. Our approach overcomes the limitations of continuum macroscopic descriptions and introduces an empirical method, applicable in experiments, to detect nonequilibrium transitions in the structure of complex fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting particles diffusing in single-file is a fundamental model of transport in narrow channels where particles cannot bypass each other. An important result has been obtained by Kollmann [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 180602 (2003)] for the mean square displacement of a tracer for any single-file model. It applies to any diffusive system, in particular the notable classes of colloidal systems and diffusive stochastic lattice gases. Since then, no analog result has been obtained in the important case where the particles are driven by an external field. Here, we fill this gap and determine the fluctuations and the skewness of the tracer's position for any driven diffusive system. In addition, we also consider a variety of important observables such as the integrated current, the response of the system to the perturbation induced by the displacement of the tracer, and the correlations between several tracers. Furthermore, we also unveil fundamental relations underlying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of driven diffusive systems. This work constitutes a step toward the determination of the full distribution of all these observables in driven one-dimensional systems of interacting particles.</description>

Abstract: The flow of information within many-body systems is a fundamental feature of physical interaction. Given an underlying classical physics model for the interaction between a particle and its environment, we give meaning to and quantify the information passed between them over time. We show that the maximum information exchange rate is proportional to the ratio of inter-particle energy flow and initial particle energy -- a sort of signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, a single time-point (as opposed to trajectory) observability relation emerges.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Flow of Information in a Nonequilibrium Process in the Presence of Hydrodynamic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the origin of nonequilibrium characteristics in a generic interacting system having multiple degrees of freedom is a challenging task. In this context, information theoretic measures such as mutual information and related polymorphs offer valuable insights. Here, we explore these measures in a minimal experimental model consisting of two hydrodynamically coupled colloidal particles, where a nonequilibrium drive is introduced via an exponentially correlated noise acting on one of the particles. We show that the information-theoretic tools considered enable a systematic, data-driven dissection of information flow within the system. These measures allow us to identify the driving node and reconstruct the directional dependencies between particles. Notably, they help explain a recently observed, counterintuitive trend in the dependence of irreversibility on interaction strength under coarse-graining (B. Das et.al., arXiv:2405.00800 (2024)). Finally, our results demonstrate how directional information measures can uncover the hidden structure of nonequilibrium dynamics and provide a framework for studying similar effects in more complex systems.</description>

      <title>Gears in Chemical Reaction Networks: Optimizing Energy Transduction Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17960v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Similarly to gear systems in vehicles, most chemical reaction networks (CRNs) involved in energy transduction have at their disposal multiple transduction pathways, each characterized by distinct efficiencies. We conceptualize these pathways as `chemical gears' and demonstrate their role in refining the second law of thermodynamics. This allows us to determine the optimal efficiency of a CRN, and the gear enabling it, solely based on its topology and operating conditions, defined by the chemical potentials of its input and output species. By suitably tuning reaction kinetics, a CRN can be engineered to self-regulate its gear settings, maintaining optimal efficiency under varying external conditions. We demonstrate this principle in a biological context with a CRN where enzymes function as gear shifters, autonomously adapting the system to achieve near-optimal efficiency across changing environments. Additionally, we examine artificial molecular motors and reveal that their gearing mechanisms are far from optimally regulated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chaos is central to understanding quantum dynamics and is crucial for generating random quantum states, a key resource for quantum information tasks. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics, termed pseudochaotic dynamics. Although distinct from chaotic dynamics, out-of-time-ordered correlators, the key indicators of quantum chaos, fail to distinguish them. Moreover, pseudochaotic dynamics generates pseudorandom states that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random states. We construct pseudochaotic dynamics by embedding a smaller $k$-qubit subsystem into a larger $n$-qubit system. We demonstrate that a subsystem of size $k=\omega(\log n)$ is sufficient to induce pseudochaotic behavior in the entire $n$-qubit system. Furthermore, we construct a quantum circuit exhibiting pseudochaotic dynamics and demonstrate that it generates pseudorandom states within $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ depth. In summary, our results constitute the discovery of new quantum dynamics that are computationally indistinguishable from genuine quantum chaos, which provides efficient routes to generate useful pseudorandom states.</description>

      <title>Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12130v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit aspects of dynamics and stability of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. By a combination of analytic and numerical techniques, we show that localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold and that localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, the constants of motion in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation play a crucial role. An infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.</description>

      <title>Energy Transduction in Complex Networks with Multiple Resources: The Chemistry Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the traditional framework of steady state energy transduction -- typically characterized by a single input and output -- to multi-resource transduction in open chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Transduction occurs when stoichiometrically balanced processes are driven against their spontaneous directions by coupling them with thermodynamically favorable ones. However, when multiple processes (resources) interact through a shared CRN, identifying the relevant set of processes for analyzing transduction becomes a critical and complex challenge. To address this, we introduce a systematic procedure based on elementary processes, which cannot be further decomposed into subprocesses. Our theory generalizes the methodology used to define transduction efficiency in thermal engines operating between multiple heat baths. By selecting a reference equilibrium environment, it explicitly reveals the inherently relative nature of transduction efficiency and ties its definition to exergy. This framework also allows one to exclude unusable outputs from efficiency calculations. We further extend the concept of chemical gears to multi-process transduction, demonstrating their versatility as an analytical tool in complex settings. Finally, we apply our framework to central metabolic pathways, uncovering deep insights into their operation and highlighting the crucial difference between thermodynamic efficiencies and stoichiometric yields.</description>

Abstract: The maximum entropy principle, as applied to quantum systems, is a fundamental prescript positing that for a quantum system for which we only have partial knowledge, the maximum entropy state consistent with the partial knowledge is a valuable choice as the system's state. An intriguing result is that in case the only prior knowledge is of a fixed mean energy, the maximum entropy state turns out to be the thermal state, a ubiquitous state in several arenas, especially in statistical mechanics. We extend the consequences of this principle from static quantum states to dynamic quantum processes. We establish that a quantum channel attains maximal entropy under a fixed mean energy constraint if and only if it is an absolutely thermalizing channel whose fixed output is the thermal state of the same mean energy. This provides an alternative approach for understanding the emergence of absolute thermalization processes within the observable part of the universe under physically natural energy constraints. Our results have potential implications for understanding the informational and thermodynamic utility of quantum channels under physical constraints. As an application, we examine the consequences for private randomness distillation from energy-constrained quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10661</link>

Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements. Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50% reduction in calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>
