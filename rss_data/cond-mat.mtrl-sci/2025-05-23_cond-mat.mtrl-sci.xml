      <title>Phonon, Infrared and Raman Spectra of LiGa5O8 from Density Functional Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiGa$_5$O$_8$ with a cubic spinel type structure was recently reported to be a ultra-wide-band-gap semiconductor with unintentional p-type conduction. While the origin of p-type doping is still unclear, the fundamental properties of this material are of interest. Here we present a first-principles study of the phonons using density functional perturbation theory. The phonon band structures show no unstable modes verifying the stability of the structure. We focus mainly on the phonons at the Brillouin zone center for which a full symmetry analysis is presented. We present the dielectric function contributions from the infrared active modes as well as the Raman spectra and their polarization dependence. The phonon density of states integrated over the Brillouin zone is also presented as this may related to disordered Raman spectra.</description>

      <title>Electronic mobility, doping, and defects in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaZrS_3}$ chalcogenide perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the electronic transport properties of $\mathrm{BaZrS_3}$ (BZS) thin films grown epitaxially by gas-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We observe n-type behavior in all samples, with carrier concentration ranging from $4 \times 10^{18}$ to $4 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ at room temperature (RT). We observe a champion RT Hall mobility of 11.1 $\mathrm{cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}}$, which is competitive with established thin-film photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. Temperature-dependent Hall mobility data show that phonon scattering dominates at room temperature, in agreement with computational predictions. X-ray diffraction data illustrate a correlation between mobility and stacking fault concentration, illustrating how microstructure can affect transport. Despite the well-established environmental stability of chalcogenide perovskites, we observe significant changes to electronic properties as a function of storage time in ambient conditions. With the help of secondary-ion mass-spectrometry (SIMS) measurements, we propose and support a defect mechanism that explains this behavior: as-grown films have a high concentration of sulfur vacancies that are shallow donors ($\mathrm{V_S^\bullet}$ or $\mathrm{V_S^{\bullet \bullet}}$), which are converted into neutral oxygen defects ($\mathrm{O_S^\times}$) upon air exposure. We discuss the relevance of this defect mechanism within the larger context of chalcogenide perovskite research, and we identify means to stabilize the electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Distribution of antiferromagnetic rare-earth domains in multiferroic Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many multiferroics, rare-earth and transition-metal orders exist side by side. For analyzing their interaction and its consequences for the multiferroic state, the associated domain patterns and their spatial correlation can give valuable insight. Unfortunately, this is often hampered by the lack of access to the domains of the rare-earth order. Here, we uncover such a domain pattern for the antiferromagnetic and multiferroic Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$. Optical second harmonic generation reveals the formation of column-like Dy/Tb domains. Interestingly, the columns form perpendicular to the magnetically induced electric polarization. Hence, the antiferromagnetic rare-earth order forces the ferroelectric domains to form nominally charged head-to-head and tail-to-tail domain walls, thus playing a leading role in the domain formation within the multiferroic phase. In turn, to reduce energy cost, the ferroelectric order causes a reduced rare-earth domain-wall density along the direction of the electric polarization. This interplay highlights the multiferroic character of the Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$ domain pattern. We position Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$ within the broader landscape of rare-earth multiferroics and identify three distinct scenarios for the role of rare-earth order in these.</description>

      <title>Exact Expansion Formalism for Transport Properties of Heterogeneous Materials Characterized by Arbitrary Continuous Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact contrast-expansion formalism for the effective conductivity of heterogeneous materials (media) with local properties described by arbitrary continuous random fields, significantly generalizing the widely used binary-field models. The theory produces a rapidly convergent Neumann-series that, upon Gaussian closure via a Hermite expansion, yields closed-form first-, second- and third-order approximations, which achieve percent-level accuracy at first order for isotropic media. For anisotropic media, second-order approximations achieve sub-2% accuracy across a wide range of local property contrasts and correlations. Our formalism provides mathematically rigorous structure-property closures, with significant implications for the discovery and design of novel graded and architected materials with tailored transport properties.</description>

      <title>Diffraction Stress Factors Calculated Using a Maximum Entropy Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction-based stress analysis of textured materials depends on understanding their elastic heterogeneity and its influence on microscopic strain distributions, which is generally done by using simplifying assumptions for crystallite interactions to calculate tensorial stress factors or in the case of very strong textures, by considering the material phase as a single crystal (crystallite group method). In this paper, we apply the micromechanical Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) to this purpose, which marks its first use for materials with texture. The special feature of this approach is a native parametrization by the effective stiffness of the material, which allows the approach to be tailored to a macroscopically measurable sample property. We perform example stress analyses of cold-rolled copper, finding through validation with full-field simulations that the MEM yields accurate local strains even for materials with extremely sharp textures. In an example stress analysis of mildly textured cold-rolled ferritic steel, the accuracy of the approach compares favorably to the established Voigt, Reuss and self-consistent Eshelby-Kr\"oner approaches. Compared to the latter, the method is also numerically efficient to calculate.</description>

      <title>Materials Generation in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials are the foundation of modern society, underpinning advancements in energy, electronics, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure. The ability to discover and design new materials with tailored properties is critical to solving some of the most pressing global challenges. In recent years, the growing availability of high-quality materials data combined with rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for accelerating materials discovery. Data-driven generative models provide a powerful tool for materials design by directly create novel materials that satisfy predefined property requirements. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in AI-driven materials generation. We first organize various types of materials and illustrate multiple representations of crystalline materials. We then provide a detailed summary and taxonomy of current AI-driven materials generation approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the common evaluation metrics and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude with potential future directions and challenges in this fast-growing field.

      <title>Electronic and Vibrational Properties of Layered Boron Nitride Polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, and vibrational properties of four layered boron nitride (BN) polymorphs--AA-stacked ($e$-BN), AA$^\prime$-stacked ($h$-BN), ABC-stacked ($r$-BN), and AB-stacked ($b$-BN). Using density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory with and without van der Waals (vdW) corrections, we quantify the impact of interlayer dispersion on lattice parameters, electronic band gaps, phonon frequencies, and infrared and Raman intensities. Our results demonstrate that vdW interactions are essential for reproducing experimental lattice constants and stabilizing interlayer phonon modes. The vibrational spectra exhibit distinct stacking-dependent features, enabling clear differentiation among polytypes. Notably, $b$-BN displays a direct band gap, while $r$-BN shows enhanced IR and Raman activity due to LO-TO splitting and symmetry breaking. These findings underscore the critical role of interlayer interactions in determining the physical properties of $sp^2$-bonded BN and offer insight into the experimental identification and functionalization of BN polytypes for electronic and photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Kinetically controlling surface atom arrangements in thermally robust, amorphous high-entropy alloy nanoparticles by solvent selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to tailor nanoscale surface atom arrangements through multi-elemental compositional control provides high-entropy nanoalloys with promising functional properties. Developing a fundamental understanding of nanoalloy formation mechanisms during synthesis is therefore essential for effectively engineering the surface composition and resulting functional properties. Using the Cantor alloy (CrMnFeCoNi) as a model system, we investigate how solvent selection during reactive, nanosecond-pulsed laser synthesis influences carbon doping and the resulting changes in nanoparticle morphology, structure, and composition. Supersaturated carbon incorporation, partitioned from the organic solvent molecules, produces amorphous nanoparticles with distinctive carbon shells, thermally stable up to 350 {\deg}C. We propose kinetically controlled particle formation mechanisms and rationalize the criticality of the time scales between the competing reactions of carbon doping, carbon shell formation, and coalescence of metallic fragments, ruling compositional and morphological characteristics. This work demonstrates effective solvent-driven surface-compositional control in amorphous high-entropy nanoalloys. It introduces a novel synthesis approach for tailoring surface atom arrangements through carbon incorporation via reactive, pulsed laser synthesis.</description>

      <title>Phonon-limited carrier transport in the Weyl semimetal TaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Weyl semimetals represent a novel class of quantum materials that exhibit remarkable properties arising from their unique electronic structure. In this work, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio methods to investigate the role of the electron-phonon interactions on the charge transport properties of TaAs. Our calculations of the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity with the iterative Boltzmann transport equation show excellent agreement with experimental measurements above 100 K. Extending the analysis to doped systems, we demonstrate that even small shifts in the Fermi level can lead to substantial changes in conductivity, driven by the complex topology of the Fermi surface. In particular, modifications in Fermi surface nesting emerge as a key factor influencing scattering processes and carrier lifetimes. These findings offer critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport in TaAs and highlight the sensitivity of Weyl semimetals to doping and carrier dynamics.</description>

      <title>Orbital-resolved anisotropic electron pockets in electron-doped SrTiO3 observed by ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrTiO3 has attracted considerable interest as a wide-band gap semiconductor for advanced high-k capacitors and photocatalytic applications. Although previous angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies have characterized the valence band structure originating from O 2p orbitals, the conduction band arising from Ti 3d orbitals upon electron doping, which is called electron pockets, remain poorly understood. In this study, polarization-dependent ARPES measurements were performed on Nb 1%-doped SrTiO3 (001), enabling direct, orbital-selective visualization of the electron pockets. From the measured band dispersion, we quantitatively determined their effective masses, anisotropy, and electron density. Our results revealed formation of an electron pocket at the Gamma point induced by Nb doping, yielding a direct bandgap of 3.79 eV at Gamma, consistent with previous optical measurements. Furthermore, the effective masses of m1 = 0.63m0 (short-axis direction) and m2 = 8.0m0 (long-axis direction) were identified, where m0 is the free electron mass, and the Fermi surface has been shown to be ellipsoidal. The electron density derived from these dispersions was found to be 3.58e20 cm-3. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of the conduction-band electronic structure that will be crucial in the design of STO-based functional devices.</description>

      <title>Tailored Vapor Deposition Unlocks Large-Grain, Wafer-Scale Epitaxial Growth of 2D Magnetic CrCl3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional magnetic materials (2D-MM) are an exciting playground for fundamental research, and for spintronics and quantum sensing. However, their large-grain large-area synthesis using scalable vapour deposition methods is still an unsolved challenge. Here, we develop a tailored approach for centimetre-scale growth of semiconducting 2D-MM CrCl3 films on mica substrate, via physical vapour transport deposition. A controlled synthesis protocol, enabled via innovations concerning light management, very-high carrier-gas flow, precursor flux, and oxygen/moisture removal, is critical for wafer-scale growth. Optical, stoichiometric, structural, and magnetic characterization identify crystalline, phase-pure 2D-MM CrCl3. Substrate temperature tunes thickness of films from few-layers to tens of nanometres. Further, selective-area growth and large-area transfer are demonstrated. Substrate-dependent growth features are explained by density functional theory and state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potential-based atomic-scale simulations. This scalable vapour deposition approach can be applied for growth of several 2D-MM, and low growth temperature (~500 C) will enable creation of hybrid heterostructures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of MoS$_2$ polymorphs, specifically the semiconducting 2H phase and the metallic 1T$^\prime$ phase, as anchoring materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$ exhibits stronger Li-S interactions, greater charge transfer, and enhanced catalytic activity compared to its 2H counterpart, effectively suppressing polysulfide dissolution and facilitating redox reactions. The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for next-generation Li-S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ as a new prototype structure for ternary superhydrides recoverable at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaching pressures in the 100 GPa range enables the synthesis of hydrogen-rich compounds, with nontraditional H stoichiometries and H sublattices, called superhydrides. Record-breaking superconductivity temperature in some superhydrides have attracted great interest. A crucial next step is to stabilize superhydrides outside of high-pressure environments, leading to a search beyond binary hydrides to ternary hydrides. Here, we report the synthesis of Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ at pressures starting at 60 GPa by compressing an hydrogenated Y-Fe compound, embedded in hydrogen in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction allowed us to resolve the Y$_3$Fe$_4$ lattice skeleton, and a constrained ab initio structural search was used to position the hydrogen atoms. FeH$_8$ cubic molecular units form building blocks which are connected edge-to-edge by sharing two hydrogen atoms, creating a framework that hosts Y cations. Remarkably, Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ maintains its structure through decompression, making it the first superhydride recovered metastable under ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of metal-biphenylene interfaces: structural, electronic, and catalytic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of biphenylene supported on various metal substrates. The substrates considered are the (111) surfaces of Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Al, and the Cu$_3$Au alloy. Our results reveal how the interaction between biphenylene and the substrate governs its stability, degree of corrugation, electronic hybridization, and interfacial charge transfer. In particular, we observe a clear trend where weakly interacting metals preserve the intrinsic features of biphenylene, while more reactive substrates lead to significant structural and electronic modifications. We further evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of these systems, showing that certain metal supports, especially Pd, Pt, Ag, and Cu, can enhance the catalytic performance of biphenylene. Notably, Ag and Cu combine good catalytic activity with lower cost and chemical stability, offering a promising balance for practical applications. These findings provide insights into the design of biphenylene-metal interfaces, supporting their use in next-generation electronic and catalytic devices.</description>

      <title>Improvement of H$_2$O$_2$ electrogeneration using a Vulcan XC72 carbon-based electrocatalyst modified with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$</title>

Abstract: The use of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for in-situ production of H$_2$O$_2$ is an attractive alternative to replace the methods based on anthraquinone oxidation. This study investigates the modification of Vulcan XC72 carbon with Ce-doped Nb$_2$O$_5$ in different molar proportions and its application as electrocatalysts in the ORR. One performed the characterization of the electrocatalysts using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, contact angle measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequently, the electrocatalysts were analyzed for the ORR and the Nb$_2$O$_5$ doped with 0.5% Ce showing the highest electrocatalytic response. This electrocatalyst was also employed as a gas diffusion electrode and exhibited more significant H$_2$O$_2$ production at all potentials than the Vulcan XC72 carbon modified solely with Nb$_2$O$_5$. At the applied potentials of -1.3 V and -1.9 V, it produced 105% and 86% more H$_2$O$_2$, respectively, than the Vulcan XC72 carbon modified only with Nb$_2$O$_5$. These results can be attributed to the doping of Nb$_2$O$_5$ with 0.5% Ce, which induces local distortions in the crystal lattice of Nb$_2$O$_5$ due to the difference in ionic radius between Nb$^{5+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$, which combined with increased hydrophilicity and wetting properties, may have facilitated electron transfer and O$_2$ transport, favoring the ORR.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration from O2 electroreduction: a review focusing on carbon electrocatalysts and environmental applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stands as one of the foremost utilized oxidizing agents in modern times. The established method for its production involves the intricate and costly anthraquinone process. However, a promising alternative pathway is the electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production, accomplished through the oxygen reduction reaction via a 2-electron pathway. This method not only simplifies the production process but also upholds environmental sustainability, especially when compared to the conventional anthraquinone method. In this review paper, recent works from the literature focusing on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction promoted by carbon electrocatalysts are summarized. The practical applications of these materials in the treatment of effluents contaminated with different pollutants (drugs, dyes, pesticides, and herbicides) are presented. Water treatment aiming to address these issues can be achieved through advanced oxidation electrochemical processes such as electro-Fenton, solar-electro-Fenton, and photo-electro-Fenton. These processes are discussed in detail in this work and the possible radicals that degrade the pollutants in each case are highlighted. The review broadens its scope to encompass contemporary computational simulations focused on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction, employing different models to describe carbon-based electrocatalysts. Finally, perspectives and future challenges in the area of carbon-based electrocatalysts for H2O2 electrogeneration are discussed. This review paper presents a forward-oriented viewpoint of present innovations and pragmatic implementations, delineating forthcoming challenges and prospects of this ever-evolving field.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced electronic excitations drive polymerization of carbon monoxide: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under pressure, carbon monoxide (CO) transforms into a polymer that can be recovered to ambient conditions. While this transformation can occur without additional stimuli, experimental observations have shown that laser irradiation can induce a similar transformation at reduced pressure. The resulting polymeric phase, which is metastable under ambient conditions, releases energy through decomposition into more stable configurations. Using time-dependent density functional theory and Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the mechanism by which electronic excitation facilitates CO polymerization. Our calculations reveal that electronic excitation enhances carbon-carbon bonding, enabling polymerization at pressures significantly lower than those required by conventional compression methods. These findings suggest that a photo-assisted approach could be employed to synthesize novel, potentially energetic materials under less demanding pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Activation of anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization by domain walls in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of unconventional antiferromagnets, characterized by a N\'eel ordering that does not break the translation symmetry of the underlying lattice. Depending on the orientation of the N\'eel vector, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) may or may not exist. In the so-called pure altermagnets, AHE is forbidden by the magnetic symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in pure altermagnets, the domain walls can lift the symmetry constraints, thereby activating the AHE and orbital magnetization. Taking a representative example of a rutile-lattice tight-binding minimal model in slab geometry, we use the linear response theory to demonstrate the emergence of the domain wall AHE, finding that it is closely related with the orbital magnetization, while the spin magnetization does not play a significant role. Using Landau theory, we argue that while for a random arrangement of $\pi$ domain walls, the contributions from the individual domain walls will cancel one another, an external magnetic field will favor domain-wall arrangements with specific chirality giving rise to a net AHE signal. Using group theory, we discuss how these findings can be generalized straightforwardly to certain other classes of altermagnets. Our work reveals a crucial role of the domain walls in the understanding of the Hall transport and orbital magnetism of altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Self-heating electrochemical memory for high-precision analog computing</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is pushing the limits of digital computing to such an extent that, if current trends were to continue, global energy consumption from computation alone would eclipse all other forms of energy within the next two decades. One promising approach to reduce energy consumption and to increase computational speed is in-memory analog computing. However, analog computing necessitates a fundamental rethinking of computation at the material level, where information is stored as continuously variable physical observables. This shift introduces challenges related to the precision, dynamic range, and reliability of analog devices - issues that have hindered the development of existing memory technology for use in analog computers. Here, we address these issues in the context of memory which stores information as resistance. Our approach utilizes an electrochemical cell to tune the bulk oxygen-vacancy concentration within a metal oxide film. Through leveraging the gate contact as both a heater and source of electrochemical currents, kinetic barriers are overcome to enable a dynamic range of nine decades of analog tunable resistance, more than 3,000 available states, and programming with voltages less than 2 V. Furthermore, we demonstrate deterministic write operations with high precision, current-voltage linearity across six decades, and programming speeds as fast as 15 ns. These characteristics pave the way toward low-power analog computers with potential to improve AI efficiency by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast charge-transfer dynamics in Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ from time-resolved optical reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ time-resolved optical reflectivity to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of the charge-transfer gap (CTG) in a parent cuprate compound Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (CCOC). We observe a persistent photoinduced red shift of the CTG that lasts up to 1000 ps. The red shift during the slow decay after 10 ps can be well modeled by the localized picture, whereas its maximum value at ~0.9 ps involves additional contribution from the renormalization of the Hubbard U due to screening effect from delocalized electrons. Furthermore, coupling between the mid-gap absorption and a slow acoustic phonon launches coherent oscillations below the CTG, observed as a ~20 GHz modulation with a dispersion independent of the pump fluence. These results demonstrate the tunning of the CTG by light, unveil complex interplay between multiple degrees of freedom, and contribute to a deeper understanding of superconductivity and correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Charge State Controlled Spin-Wave Dynamics in Nanoscale Three-Dimensional Artificial Spin Ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer a versatile platform for exploring complex spin textures and spin-wave (SW) dynamics, with implications in next-generation spintronic and magnonic technologies. Advances in 3D nanofabrication have allowed a wide-range of structures and phenomena to be realized. Whilst the study of simple cylindrical magnetic nanowires allows the realization of ultrafast domain walls and a spin Cherenkov effect, placing such wires of complex cross-section into 3D arrangements allows one to produce magnetic metamaterials, known as artificial spin-ice (ASI), where the overall ground state and spin dynamics are governed by magnetostatic interactions between elements. Here, using Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) we demonstrate the direct detection of magnetic charged states in a 3D-ASI system. The measured spin-wave modes in 3D-ASI are found to be directly controlled by the local magnetic charge configuration and the direction of the applied magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations provide insight into the spatially selective excitation of spin waves and the evolution of magnetic microstates, uncovering a direct link to the field-dependent characteristics of the spin-wave spectrum. These findings make 3D-ASI architectures a promising system to realize reconfigurable, low-power magnonic devices with engineered collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>High-pressure high-temperature solution growth, structural, and superconducting properties of Fe-substituted MgB2 single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarifying the impact of Fe doping on the structural and superconducting properties of MgB2 is crucial, considering that iron is commonly used as a sheath material for the fabrication of metal-clad MgB2 wires and tapes. To date the effects of Fe doping have only been investigated in polycrystalline samples, but the obtained results are controversial. Here, we report the successful growth of Mg1-xFexB2 single crystals in a quaternary Mg-Fe-B-N system using the cubic anvil high-pressure and high-temperature technique. The reaction took place in a closed boron nitride crucible at a pressure of 3 GPa and a temperature of 1960 {\deg}C. The grown crystals exhibit plate-like shapes with sizes up to 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.1 mm3. The variation of the critical temperature Tc of Mg1-xFexB2 crystals with Fe content was found to be different from that observed in polycrystalline samples. For a small Fe doping, up to x &lt; 0.03, the behaviour of Tc(x) is similar to that for the crystals with Al and C substitutions, which suggests that Fe is in non-magnetic state. In this doping range, measurements of the temperature-dependent magnetization performed in high magnetic fields exclude spin states other than S = 0 for the Fe ions. However, for x &gt; 0.03, certain crystals start to show a dramatic decrease in Tc, suggesting that Fe might be in a magnetic state. The M-H dependence for these crystals shows significant increase of magnetization with increasing field in low magnetic field, pointing to a weak ferromagnetism. Overall, the availability of Fe substituted MgB2 single crystals exhibiting such peculiar behaviour offers a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of disorder alone on one hand and the influence of magnetic substituent on the superconducting characteristics on the other.</description>

      <title>Effect of spark plasma sintering on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We optimize the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide (Sm1111: SmFeAsO0.80F0.20) by using the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique under various synthesis conditions, including heating temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 {\deg}C for durations of 5 to 30 minutes at the applied pressure of 45 MPa. All prepared bulks are characterized by structural and microstructural analysis as well as transport and magnetic measurements to conclude our findings. SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 bulks are also prepared using the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) and the high gas pressure and high temperature (HP-HTS) methods at 500 MPa, which exhibit a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of ~54 K. Interestingly, the SPS process of SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 increases the sample densities up to 97-98% and confirms the optimized synthesis conditions of 900{\deg}C for 5-10 min; however, the increased sintering temperature or duration reduces Tc due to the possible evaporation of lighter elements, particularly fluorine. Furthermore, the SPS technique is unable to reduce the observed impurity phases for the Sm1111, which is similar to the CSP and HP-HTS processes. A slight increment in the Jc by the SPS process is observed due to the enhancement of sample density. A comparative analysis of Sm1111 superconductors prepared by SPS is performed with CSP and HP-HTS processes, suggesting that an increased sample density is ineffective on the superconducting properties in the presence of the impurity phases. This finding can be beneficial for the fundamental and applied research of iron-based superconductor (FBS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid metallic nanoalloys combining plasmonic and catalytic metals are essential for developing advanced photocatalysts. A promising design called core-satellites comprises a spherical nanogold dotted with smaller transition-metal clusters. While these nanoalloys' catalytic activity and hot-carriers generation have been extensively studied, their morphological stability remains poorly explored. Performing molecular dynamics simulations, we highlight the critical role of the transition metal in governing the morphological stability of plasmonic core-satellites. Rh satellites exhibit the highest stability, while only 27\% Pt and 16\% Pd satellites survive after 200 ns at 600K. AuPt and AuPd quickly rearrange into single spherical nanostructures. AuPt forms icosahedra with an Au outer shell due to Au's surface diffusion. AuPd favors FCC and decahedral shapes and shows the highest Au mobility and significant Pd interdiffusion. In contrast, AuRh maintains its original shape, exhibiting a slow surface diffusion of gold onto rhodium and negligible mixing.</description>

      <title>Universal estimates for the density of states for aperiodic block subwavelength resonator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spectral properties of aperiodic block subwavelength resonator systems in one dimension, with a primary focus on the density of states. We prove that for random block configurations, as the number of blocks $M\to \infty$, the integrated density of states converges to a non-random, continuous function. We show both analytically and numerically that the density of states exhibits a tripartite decomposition: it vanishes identically within bandgaps; it forms smooth, band-like distributions in shared pass bands (a consequence of constructive eigenmode interactions); and, most notably, it exhibits a distinct fractal-like character in hybridisation regions. We demonstrate that this fractal-like behaviour stems from the limited interaction between eigenmodes within these hybridisation regions. Capitalising on this insight, we introduce an efficient meta-atom approach that enables rapid and accurate prediction of the density of states in these hybridisation regions. This approach is shown to extend to systems with quasiperiodic and hyperuniform arrangements of blocks.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependence of the interfacial polarization and negative activation volume for dielectric relaxation in heterogeneous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative activation volumes for dielectric relaxation are rarely reported in solid state physics and are limited to atomic scale processes. Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy on heterogeneous systems, such as polycrystalline calcite and magnesite, hosting water in their porous spce, detectedintense dielectric relaxation mechanisms related to the interfacial polarization. The characteristic relaxation frequency increased uponhydrostatic compression, indicating that the activation volumes for relaxation are negative. However, a theoretical interpretation for the negative sign of the activation volume is lacking up to date. Within the frame of effective medium approximation for mesoscopic heterogeneous two phase solid - fluid systems, we investigate how the synergyof the pressure depedencies of polarization and electric charge transport, respectively, dictate the pressure dependence of interfacial polarization . predicting the value of the effective activation volume. Our theoretical approach succeeds in predicting the negative sign and magnitude of the activation volume in water saturated polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic inverse band gap versus polarization relation in ferroelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials have promising applications in solar-energy conversion and electro-optic devices. The internal gradient fields produced by the macroscopic polarization may improve electronic and transport semiconducting properties. However, ferroelectrics tend to display relatively large band gaps and hence low solar-energy conversion efficiencies. In this work, we explore materials with an intrinsic inverse relation between band gap and polarization in a single ferroelectric phase. Ferroelectrics with an inverse band gap versus polarization relation are characterized by low density of states contribution at the conduction states and negligible orbital hybridization at the valence states. We use high-throughput and first principles methods to find 15 ferroelectric materials with an inverse band gap versus polarization relation in the Materials Project database. Our work provides a new pathway to design small-band gap large-polarization ferroelectrics, by simultaneously tailoring the band gap and polarization of ferroelectrics with an inverse relation through an external tuning parameter.</description>

      <title>Exploration of stable atomic configurations in graphene-like BCN systems by Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: h-BCN is an intriguing material system where the bandgap varies considerably depending on the atomic configuration, even at a fixed composition. Exploring stable atomic configurations in this system is crucial for discussing the energetic formability and controllability of desirable configurations. In this study, this challenge is tackled by combining first-principles calculations with Bayesian optimization. An encoding method that represents the configurations as vectors, while incorporating information about the local atomic environments and domain knowledge, is proposed for the search. The proposed encoding method proved effective in the search, resulting in the discovery of two interesting and stable semiconductor configurations. Furthermore, the optimization behavior is discussed through principal component analysis, confirming that the ordered BN network and the C configuration features are well embedded in the search space. While our approach provided a tailored encoding for the h-BCN system in this study, it holds promise for broader application to other materials by adapting the domain knowledge matrix to each target system.</description>

      <title>Small hole polarons in yellow phase $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A heterophase containing both the optically active $\alpha$-CsPbI$_3$ and non-active $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ has been demonstrated as an efficient white light emitter. This has challenged the conventional perspective that non-active phases of perovskites are undesirable in any perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. To understand the role that the yellow phase $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ plays in the light emission process, we performed a systematic computational study on its electronic and optical properties, which are relatively unexplored in the literature. Using the Fr\"ohlich model we showed that the electron and hole both exhibit moderate coupling to longitudinal optical phonons. Explicit density functional theory calculations show that small hole polarons exist with a formation energy of -96 meV, corresponding to the contraction of the Pb-I bonds within a [PbI$_6$] octahedra and wavefunction localization. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the small hole polaron is stable against thermal disorder, and exhibit periodic localization and delocalization behavior similar to carrier hopping with a characteristic lifetime of 0.3 ps. Our results might have elucidated the role that $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ play in the self-trapped emission in perovskite-based white light emitting diodes by supporting the presence of a localized small hole polaron.</description>

      <title>Dark Metastable Conduction Channels near a Metal-Insulator Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two main states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many mysteries at the frontier of solid state physics. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the metal-insulator transition is linked to a metastable hidden state arising within a chiral charge density wave (CDW) whose basic nature remains an open question. In this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create current-carrying filamentary channels that distinguish the 'metallic' hidden state and 'insulating' CDW states. These channels have remained dark to previous measurements, and yet are directly linked to the properties of the hidden state. We leverage the metastability of these conduction channels to demonstrate electrical control of their creation, erasure and location. Our findings show that physical elements, such as boundaries and interfaces, play a key role in the properties of the hidden state characterizing the metal-insulator transition. We suggest new possibilities for in-situ electrical design of synaptic components with possible applications to neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>The multi-state geometry of shift current and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum metric and Berry curvature capture essential properties of non-trivial Bloch states and underpin many fascinating phenomena. However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsically multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using previously calculated minimal tight-binding models, and demonstrated analytically on a three-band generalization of the Rice-Mele chain to elucidate the different contributions. We close with comments on further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.</description>

      <title>Defect-induced spin textures in magnetic solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in isotropic noncollinear antiferromagnets produce long-range spin textures. By developing a "magnetic elasticity theory", we demonstrate that a vacancy-induced readjustment in the spin configuration decays algebraically with distance. The power law exponent depends on the multipole moment of a local spin deformation, which in turn is determined by the lattice symmetry and an equilibrium spin configuration in the absence of defects. The role of these two factors is highlighted for the J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice. A vacancy in this model generates spin deformations that decay as 1/r^2 for the q=0 ground state and as a 1/r for the sqrt{3} x sqrt{3} magnetic structure. The analytic conclusions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. We also compute the fractional magnetic moments associated with vacancies and other lattice defects. Our results shed light on relative fragility of different magnetic structures with respect to spin glass formation at higher doping levels.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant projector calculus for quantum state geometry and applications to observables in crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research. More complex aspects of geometry emerge in properties linking multiple bands, such as optical responses. In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Structural Properties of In-Situ MOCVD Grown Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the electrical and structural properties of MOSCAPs with in-situ MOCVD-grown Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics on (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs showed a strong dependence on Al$_2$O$_3$ deposition temperature. At 900$^\circ$C, reduced voltage hysteresis ($\sim$0.3 V) and improved reverse breakdown voltage (74.5 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 5.01 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 4.11 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. At 650$^\circ$C, higher hysteresis ($\sim$3.44 V) and lower reverse breakdown voltage (38.8 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 3.69 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 2.87 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. However, forward breakdown fields improved from 5.62 MV/cm (900$^\circ$C) to 7.25 MV/cm (650$^\circ$C). STEM revealed improved crystallinity and sharper interfaces at 900$^\circ$C, enhancing reverse breakdown performance. For Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs, increasing Al composition ($x$ = 5.5\% to 9.2\%) reduced carrier concentration and improved reverse breakdown fields from 2.55 to 2.90 MV/cm in $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ and 2.41 to 3.13 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$. Forward breakdown fields in Al$_2$O$_3$ improved from 5.0 to 5.4 MV/cm as Al composition increased. STEM confirmed compositional homogeneity and excellent stoichiometry of Al$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ layers. These findings highlight the robust electrical performance, high breakdown fields, and structural quality of Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs for high-power applications.</description>

      <title>Spin photonic topological metasurface based on kagome lattice and leaky-wave application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of topological metasurfaces offers unique advantages, particularly in robustness against backscattering in low-profile structures. The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path. One of the most studied lattices in condensed matter physics is the kagome lattice, characterized by its hexagonal Brillouin zone, which displays a Dirac cone in its dispersion diagram. Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>

      <title>SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</description>
