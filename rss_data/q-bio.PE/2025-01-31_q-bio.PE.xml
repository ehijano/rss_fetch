      <title>Ancestral process for infectious disease outbreaks with superspreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an infectious disease outbreak is of a relatively small size, describing the ancestry of a sample of infected individuals is difficult because most ancestral models assume large population sizes. Given a set of infected individuals, we show that it is possible to express exactly the probability that they have the same infector, either inclusively (so that other individuals may have the same infector too) or exclusively (so that they may not). To compute these probabilities requires knowledge of the offspring distribution, which determines how many infections each infected individual causes. We consider transmission both without and with superspreading, in the form of a Poisson and a Negative-Binomial offspring distribution, respectively. We show how our results can be incorporated into a new lambda-coalescent model which allows multiple lineages to coalesce together. We call this new model the omega-coalescent, we compare it with previously proposed alternatives, and advocate its use in future studies of infectious disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>A survey of the monotonicity and non-contradiction of consensus methods and supertree methods</title>

Abstract: In a recent study, Bryant, Francis and Steel investigated the concept of \enquote{future-proofing} consensus methods in phylogenetics. That is, they investigated if such methods can be robust against the introduction of additional data like added trees or new species. In the present manuscript, we analyze consensus methods under a different aspect of introducing new data, namely concerning the discovery of new clades. In evolutionary biology, often formerly unresolved clades get resolved by refined reconstruction methods or new genetic data analyses. In our manuscript we investigate which properties of consensus methods can guarantee that such new insights do not disagree with previously found consensus trees, but merely refine them, a property termed \emph{monotonicity}. Along the lines of analyzing monotonicity, we also study two {established} supertree methods, namely Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) and Matrix Representation with Compatibility (MRC), which have also been suggested as consensus methods in the literature. While we (just like Bryant, Francis and Steel in their recent study) unfortunately have to conclude some negative answers concerning general consensus methods, we also state some relevant and positive results concerning the majority rule ($\mathtt{MR}$) and strict consensus methods, which are amongst the most frequently used consensus methods. Moreover, we show that there exist infinitely many consensus methods which are monotonic and have some other desirable properties.

      <title>Improving the mean-field approximation in continuous models of population dynamics with nonlocal dispersal: applications to vegetation pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spot patterns, in which vegetation patches form a hexagonal lattice, are frequent in nature and could serve as an early-warning indicator of abrupt vegetation collapses. Consequently, they have been intensively studied using both individual-based models and density-based field equations. Yet, the relationship between these two approaches remains unclear, particularly in scenarios where vegetation dynamics exhibit strong long-range spatial correlations and traditional mean-field approximations fail. To solve this issue, we develop a new method that refines mean-field approximations by describing both the dynamics of the biomass density field and its spatial correlations. This new approach harnesses the strengths of both individual and density-based models, treating spatial correlations explicitly and allowing for the identification of spatial instabilities resulting in periodic patterns. Our results indicate that this new approximation predicts the parameter regimes where regular periodic patterns emerge more accurately than mean-field models, suggesting that it could provide a more robust framework to perform further nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dynamics and Probability Analysis for a Generalized Epidemic Model with Environmental Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a stochastic SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered) epidemic model with a generalized incidence function. Using the Lyapunov method, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the model, ensuring that it remains well-defined over time. Through the application of Young's inequality and Chebyshev's inequality, we demonstrate the concepts of stochastic ultimate boundedness and stochastic permanence, providing insights into the long-term behavior of the epidemic dynamics under random perturbations. Furthermore, we derive conditions for stochastic extinction, which describe scenarios where the epidemic may eventually die out, and V-geometric ergodicity, which indicates the rate at which the system's state converges to its equilibrium. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our theoretical results and assess the model's behavior under different parameters.</description>

      <title>A minimal model for multigroup adaptive SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the adaptive N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (aNIMFA) model studied in Achterberg and Sensi (2023) to a heterogeneous network of communities. In particular, the multigroup aNIMFA model describes the impact of both local and global disease awareness on the spread of a disease in a network. We obtain results on existence and stability of the equilibria of the system, in terms of the basic reproduction number $R_0$. Assuming individuals have no reason to decrease their contacts in the absence of disease, we show that the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is equivalent to the basic reproduction number of the NIMFA model on static networks. Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrate that with just two communities periodic behaviour can occur, which contrasts the case with only a single community, in which periodicity was ruled out analytically. We also find that breaking connections between communities is more fruitful compared to breaking connections within communities to reduce the disease outbreak on dense networks, but both strategies are viable to networks with fewer links. Finally, we emphasize that our method of modelling adaptivity is not limited to SIS models, but has huge potential to be applied in other compartmental models in epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Why Honor Heroes? The emergence of extreme altruistic behavior as a by-product of praisers' self-promotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heroes are people who perform costly altruistic acts. Few people turn out to be heroes, but many spontaneously honor heroes by commenting, applauding, or enthusiastically celebrating their deeds. The existence of a praising audience leads individuals to compete to attract the crowd's admiration. The outcome is a winner-take-all situation in which only one or a few individuals engage in extreme altruistic behavior. The more difficult part is to explain the crowd's propensity to pay tribute from an individual fitness optimization perspective. The model proposed here shows how heroic behavior and its celebration by a large audience may emerge together. This situation is possible if admirers use public praise as a social signal to promote their own commitment to the values displayed by the hero.</description>
