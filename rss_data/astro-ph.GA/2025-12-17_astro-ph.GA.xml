      <title>Resolving dust and Ly{\alpha} emission in a lensed galaxy at the epoch of reionization with JWST/CANUCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman $\alpha$ emission is highly sensitive to dust and neutral hydrogen and is therefore expected to be strongly suppressed in dusty or gas-rich galaxies during the epoch of reionization (EoR). Nevertheless, numerous moderately dusty Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) are observed at this epoch, suggesting that complex interstellar medium (ISM) geometries and feedback-driven outflows may facilitate Ly$\alpha$ escape. We investigate the dust, gas, and stellar properties of the gravitationally lensed LAE HCM 6A at $z=6.5676$ to characterize its multiphase ISM and the physical conditions regulating Ly$\alpha$ escape. We combine JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy, HST+JWST/NIRCam imaging, and JWST/NIRSpec slit spectra from the CANUCS program. Using a customized BAGPIPES SED-fitting framework with a flexible attenuation law, we derive stellar, nebular, and dust properties on integrated ($\sim$kpc), slit-level ($\sim$0.1 kpc), and pixel-level ($\sim$25 pc) scales, enabled by strong lensing ($\mu \approx 8.3$-$9.1$). A Ly$\alpha$ map from SLEUTH traces the spatial distribution of Ly$\alpha$ emission. We measure an unlensed stellar mass of $\log M_\ast = 8.3$-$8.4$ and an intrinsic UV magnitude of $M_{\rm UV} = -19.8 \pm 0.1$. The older region (S1) is moderately dusty with consistent stellar and nebular attenuation indicators, implying a uniform ISM geometry, while the youngest region (S3) shows strong discrepancies among dust tracers, indicating a feedback-shaped multiphase ISM. Ly$\alpha$ emission arises primarily from S3, where a dust-cleared central clump enables efficient Ly$\alpha$ escape. We find Calzetti-like attenuation curves with a UV bump that strengthens with stellar age and decreasing $A_V$. Our observations provide a uniquely detailed, spatially resolved view of a moderately dusty LAE during the EoR, demonstrating how feedback and multiphase ISM structure govern Ly$\alpha$ escape.</description>

      <title>Confirming membership in Local Group galaxies with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1) to identify stellar members of the Local Group dwarf galaxies. We cross-match DESI targets with candidate members that are based on Gaia proper motions, positions, and photometry. The addition of DESI radial velocities enables secure membership determination in 16 systems, spanning ultra-faint, classical, and irregular dwarf galaxies. Our results confirm that Gaia-based selection algorithms are effective in minimising foreground contamination. With DR1, we find the largest number of member stars for Draco and Sextans. While Draco is discussed in detail in other works, we focus on Sextans and, for the first time with DESI, trace its stellar kinematics to large radii (up to $\sim$10~half-light radii). Our derived systemic velocity and velocity dispersion are consistent with previous works. We find that the more metal-poor population exhibits a higher velocity dispersion and extends to larger radii, whereas the more metal-rich population is kinematically colder and centrally concentrated. The metallicity gradient is steeper in the inner regions of Sextans ($\sim -9\times 10^{-3}$~dex~arcmin$^{-1}$ or $\sim-0.29$~dex~kpc$^{-1}$), while almost no gradient in the outskirts, hinting for an ex-situ halo or for an ``outside-in'' star formation. Although DESI [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios for Sextans stars with [Fe/H]~$\gtrsim-2.0$ are in line with literature values, those for very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]~$\lesssim-2.0$) present a large scatter and strong anti-correlation with metallicity, warranting a caution for using DESI abundances in this regime. We find one ultra metal-poor candidate in Canes~Venatici~I, which requires higher resolution spectroscopic follow-ups.</description>

      <title>Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure II: predicting disk structure from dark-matter halo properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how galactic disk structures connect to the detailed properties of their host dark-matter halos using the TNG50 simulation. From the hydrodynamic and matched dark-matter-only runs, we measure a comprehensive list of halo properties describing density structure, angular momentum, shape, assembly history, and environment. Using the morphological decomposition developed in Paper I, we quantify the sizes, scale heights, and mass fractions of the disk components for galaxies at $0 \le z \le 4$. Random Forest (RF) regression shows halo properties alone predict disk size and thickness with high accuracy, while Symbolic Regression (SR) provides compact empirical relations with slightly lower accuracy. Disk height is consistently easier to predict than disk size, and lower-mass halos yield higher accuracy than massive halos. Predictions based on halo properties measured in the full-physics hydro simulations outperform those based on the matched dark-matter-only halos, reflecting the imprint of baryonic restructuring on the inner halo. SHAP analysis reveals that the most informative halo parameters include concentration, Einasto shape, global and inner spin, and recent mass accretion, though their importance varies across disk properties. We show that correlations between disk size and the density-profile shape arise primarily from disk-induced modification of the inner halo, rather than a primordial connection. Finally, we point out that disks become more extended with respect to their host halos at higher redshift in low-mass halos, while massive high-redshift halos show the opposite trend. We provide SR-based prescriptions that accurately map halo properties to disk structures, offering practical tools for galaxy-halo modeling.</description>

      <title>Searching for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in Milky Way satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses between roughly $10^2\,M_\odot$ and $10^5\,M_\odot$, represent a largely uncharted component of the black-hole (BH) population. They are theoretically predicted to form in several early-Universe pathways, including the remnants of massive Population III stars, the runaway collapse of dense stellar clusters, and the direct collapse of metal-poor gas. Establishing whether IMBHs are present in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW), and with what occupation fraction - i.e. the fraction of galaxies with a certain stellar mass that host a central BH - provides one of the most incisive tests of BH seed formation models. Despite their importance, present dynamical constraints on IMBHs remain weak. Dynamical IMBH masses or upper limits are available for very few such systems, with secure detections in less than ten cases. A next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility, capable of combining deep multiplexed stellar spectroscopy with high-resolution integral-field observations of galaxy centers, would open access to IMBH masses in the $\leq10\,M_\odot$ regime. Such an advance would make possible - for the first time - a robust measurement of the IMBH occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. A key scientific requirement for the coming decades is to establish the observational and instrumental capabilities needed to detect or tightly constrain IMBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies, particularly in the $\simeq10^3-10^4 \,M_\odot$ mass range, and thereby enable a measurement of their occupation fraction. Such a measurement is fundamental for distinguishing between competing scenarios for the formation of BH seeds in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Local Group dwarf galaxies as dark matter probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling the fundamental nature of non-baryonic dark matter (DM) has profound implications for our understanding of the Universe and of the physical laws that govern it. Its manifestation as an additional source of matter necessary to explain astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates either a breakdown of General Relativity or that the current Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete. In the standard Cold DM (CDM) paradigm, DM consists of collisionless non-relativistic particles with negligible non-gravitational interactions. This simple hypothesis is very successful on large and intermediate scales, but faces challenges on small galactic scales. Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies can play a fundamental role to elucidate whether these challenges stem from poorly understood fundamental baryonic processes or instead indicate that alternative DM scenarios need to be considered. In particular, a systematic determination of their DM halo properties as a function of stellar mass and star formation histories (SFH) will provide crucial observational benchmarks for models to deal with the trickiest issue that prevents us from advancing in our understanding of DM nature, i.e. the impact of baryonic processes in altering the properties of the inner regions of DM haloes. Such systematic study would require assembling accurate l.o.s. velocities (and metallicities) for several thousands of stars per galaxy, for an heterogeneous sample of target galaxies, spanning order of magnitudes in stellar mass and covering distances from about 100 kpc to more than 1 Mpc. This calls for both multi-objects spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes with fov of a few deg2 and a multiplex power in the several 1000s with the capability of providing dense sampling of the innermost regions, as well as for wide-area multi-objects spectrographs with fov of several arcmin2 on 30-40m class telescopes.</description>

      <title>The molecular diversity of the ISM in galaxies across cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submillimetre molecular lines (e.g., CO, HCN, SiO) provide a uniquely powerful view of the physical and chemical processes that govern star formation (SF) and galaxy evolution. Yet, our current picture of the molecular universe beyond the Milky Way remains strikingly incomplete: broad chemical inventories exist for only a handful of galaxies, typically more extreme than the Milky Way, constrained by sensitivity limits and narrow survey strategies. In the 2040s, surveying galaxies with multi-species, multi-transitions observations across diverse galactic environments will be crucial to establish effective chemical diagnostics of the various ISM processes from the early universe to $z=0$. Extragalactic astrochemistry provides a uniquely sensitive probe of the physical processes shaping galaxies, allowing us to understand, species by species, how gas responds to its local environment and how galaxies grow, transform, and recycle matter over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>AtLAST -- A five fold increase in the number of identified Strongly Lensed Galaxies in the sub-millimetre and its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology, dark matter (DM), and high-redshift galaxy evolution, but current samples of strongly lensed galaxies (SLGs) remain far too small to exploit its full potential. $\textit{Herschel}$'s submillimeter (submm) surveys demonstrated that submm selection provides the most efficient and least biased route to identifying high-redshift SLGs, yet produced only a few hundred systems over limited, heterogeneous fields. Achieving the thousands of SLGs required for precision cosmology and detailed studies of distant dusty star-forming galaxies demands a new, wide-area, homogeneous sub-mm survey. A facility like AtLAST, capable of extending $\textit{Herschel}$-like methodologies to much larger areas, is uniquely positioned to deliver the order-of-magnitude increase in SLG numbers needed for transformative progress.</description>

      <title>A wide-field, multi-line survey of CO in the Magellanic Clouds at parsec-scale resolution: characterising the molecular gas content with a 50-m single-dish submillimeter telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) are nearby dwarf galaxies whose proximity uniquely enables molecular cloud-scale resolution observations across the entire Magellanic system, a capability unmatched in any other external galaxy. Their low metallicities resemble conditions near the peak of cosmic star formation, allowing resolved studies of interstellar medium (ISM) phases, molecular cloud lifecycles, and feedback processes that regulate galaxy evolution. Comprehensive, wide-field spectroscopic mapping of CO and its isotopologues in different transitions, complemented by [CI] observations, and combined with already existing HI and HII surveys, will calibrate star-formation laws and gas-phase partition under low-metallicity conditions and furnish benchmarks for interpreting high-redshift galaxies and cosmological simulations. This science requires a large-aperture, wide-field submillimeter single dish with multi-pixel spectroscopic capabilities, operated from a high, dry site such as Chajnantor, to deliver fast, sensitive, high-resolution, degree-scale mapping with total-power fidelity. We present the case for a full molecular atlas of the Magellanic system, the enabling facility requirements, and the transformative impact on galaxy evolution studies</description>

      <title>Cold Gas Infall onto A Brightest Group Galaxy via A Gas-Rich Minor Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust and cold gas are not uncommon in nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs), and represent an important aspect of their evolution. However, their origin has been debated for decades. Potential sources include internal processes (e.g., mass loss from evolved stars), external mechanisms (e.g., minor mergers or cooling flows), or a combination of both. Gas-rich minor mergers have long been proposed as an important channel for cold gas fueling in both observations and simulations, but direct evidence of cold gas transportation via gas-rich minor mergers remains elusive, particularly in galaxy groups and clusters where environmental effects are prevalent. In this letter, we present the first unambiguous case of direct cold gas transportation onto a brightest group galaxy (BGG) at $z=0.25$, driven by an ongoing close-separation gas-rich minor merger with a mass ratio of $\sim1:56$. High-resolution JWST imaging reveals a heavily obscured, low-mass satellite that is barely visible at restframe optical wavelengths. Tidal stripping from this satellite deposits gas and dust onto the BGG, forming prominent $\sim$10 kpc dust lanes in situ. Cosmological simulations indicate that such interactions preferentially occur in gas-rich satellites undergoing their first infall in highly eccentric orbits. Our results highlight the pivotal role of gas-rich minor mergers in replenishing cold gas reservoirs and shaping the evolution of central ETGs in galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Reionization Epoch through 21\,cm and Line Intensity Mapping Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epoch of reionization (EoR), marking the Universe's transition from a neutral to ionized state, represents a pivotal phase for understanding the formation of the first stars and galaxies. Intensity mapping of atomic and molecular lines, such as $[\mathrm{CII}]$ and CO J-ladder transitions, across a broad redshift range is a powerful tool for investigating star formation history, metallicity, the distribution of gas and dust, and the physical conditions within galaxies. Additionally, 21\,cm line intensity mapping directly probes the neutral hydrogen content in the intergalactic medium, offering a unique window into the timing and morphology of reionization. In this study, we explore the cross-correlation between the 21\,cm signal and multi-line intensity mapping (LIM) to forecast their detectability for next-generation experiments. Our analysis emphasizes the complementary potential of these techniques to constrain parameters such as the minimum mass of ionizing sources and the ionization fraction $x_e$. Cross-correlations with LIM also enable constraints on physical properties like metal enrichment and the relationship between star formation rates and multi-line luminosities. Using mock observations from Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low 21\,cm and Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST)-like LIM experiments, we find that the $[\mathrm{CII}]$--21\,cm cross-correlation can constrain reionization history by measuring $x_e$ across multiple redshift bins with significance levels ranging from 9 to 40$\sigma$. We extend our analysis to CO transitions, showing that the CO(1-0)--21\,cm cross-correlation provides competitive constraints on reionization parameters. The synergies explored here will enable robust constraints on both reionization and LIM parameters, maximizing the scientific return of current and next-generation intensity mapping experiments.</description>

      <title>From ASTRID to BRAHMA -- The role of overmassive black holes in little red dots in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage the overmassive black holes ($\rm M_{BH}/M_{\ast} \approx0.1$) present in a realization of the BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to investigate their role in the emission of the unique ``little red dot'' (LRD) objects identified by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\rm 2.04 \pm 0.32 \times 10^{-4} \space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\rm A_V = 0.21 \pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes as Seeds for Extremely Overmassive AGN Observed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently identified Abell 2744-QSO1 as a compact, metal-poor, black hole (BH) dominated galaxy at $z\simeq 7$. This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M_{\rm BH}=5\times10^7\,M_\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\dot{m}_{\rm BH}/\dot{m}_{\rm edd} \sim 1-10\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z_\odot\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered "little red dots".</description>

      <title>How is Cold Gas Loaded into Galactic Nuclear Outflows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the multiphase gas within the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles is crucial for understanding Galactic Center (GC) feedback. We use HI4PI data to investigate the kinematics and physical properties of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) toward the GC. Our results reveal that the HVCs exhibit a distinct asymmetric distribution, closely associated with the bar-driven tilted dust lanes and the distorted overshooting streams. We propose that powerful nuclear outflows interact with these gas-rich, off-plane structures, striping and entraining cold gas from the outer Galactic regions (R_GC~0.5--1.7 kpc) rather than solely from the region of the central molecular zone (CMZ; R_GC&lt;0.3 kpc). In this scenario, as the Galactic bar drives gas inflows along the dust lanes, nuclear outflows simultaneously break through the CMZ, sweeping up and ablating cold gas from the boundary layer of these pre-existing structures. This process naturally accounts for the observed high turbulence, complex spectral signatures, and anomalous spatial-kinematic gas patterns, as well as multiwavelength asymmetries of the bubbles. The HVCs are accelerated to about 230--340 km/s over a dynamical time of ~3--6 Myr. When the multiphase, inhomogeneous composition of the gas is included, the estimated gas outflow rate reaches ~1 Msun/yr. This value is comparable to the bar-driven inflow rate, indicating a tightly coupled gas cycle in the inner Galaxy. Our research highlights the critical role of bar-driven gas dynamics and nuclear feedback in the secular evolution of the Milky Way, offering a valuable paradigm for investigating gas cycles in external galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that the Sun might have formed within a nebula impacted by at least one SNR. In this scenario, ejecta and shocks from SNRs may have provided the elements on which life as we know it is based. Investigating the chemical complexity of molecular clouds impacted by SNRs is therefore essential to unveil the star formation process and how life appeared on Earth. In this paper, we exploit this scientific questions and describe which technical specifications will drive in future generation telescopes.</description>

      <title>Can dwarf spheroidal galaxies host a central black hole ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct mass models of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies to place constraints on the central black hole (BH) masses they can host. We model the galaxies as a three-component system consisting of the stars, dark matter halo, and a central black hole, using the Osipkov--Merritt--Cuddeford class of anisotropic distribution function. The posterior distribution of black hole mass remains flat toward the low-mass end, indicating that the kinematic data places an upper limit on the black hole mass. Our analysis yields a 95% credible upper limit of $\log(M_{\bullet}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 6$. We combine our results with black hole mass measurements and upper limits from the literature to construct a unified $M_{\bullet}$--$\sigma_{}$ relation spanning $\sigma_{} \sim 10$--$300,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$, described by $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 8.32 + 4.08,\log\left(\sigma_{}/200,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}\right)$, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{\rm int} = 0.55$. We compare the inferred limits to models of black hole growth via momentum-driven accretion and stellar capture, which predict black hole masses in the range $10^{3}$--$10^{4},M_{\odot}$ for the range $\sigma_{} \sim 6$--$12,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$, in close agreement with the $M_{\bullet}$--$\sigma_{*}$ relation within the 95% credible upper limits on the black hole masses derived in this work.</description>

      <title>NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey. First measurement of the confusion noise at the IRAM 30 m telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS) is a large programme using the NIKA2 dual-band camera on the IRAM 30\,m telescope. Its goal is to improve our understanding of the physics of distant Dusty Star Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) by carrying out deep surveys of two fields, GOODS-North and COSMOS. This work is focussed on GOODS-North, which was observed for 78.2 hours, simultaneously at 1.2 and 2\,mm, with a field of view of $\sim$240\,arcmin$^2$. With such a deep integration, we were able to measure, for the first time, the confusion noise limits at the 30\,m telescope using the best sampled $\sim 62$\,arcmin$^2$ and masking sources with a flux greater than 0.54 or 0.17\,mJy at 1.2 or 2\,mm, respectively. We found a confusion noise of $139.1^{+ 15.9}_{- 19.2}\pm11.9$\,$\mu$Jy/beam at 1.2\,mm and $38.6^{+ 9.6}_{- 13.1} \pm3.7$\,$\mu$Jy/beam at 2\,mm (the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is the cosmic variance). In this region, this corresponds to half the instrumental noise. To derive these estimates, we devised a novel estimator, referred to as the cross variance, which also enabled us to estimate the correlated confusion noise between the two bands. Thus, we obtained a result of $49.6^{+ 15.9}_{- 24.8}\pm 6.4$\,$\mu$Jy/beam. These values are consistent with the state of the art Simulated Infrared Dusty Extragalactic Sky (SIDES) model.</description>

Abstract: (Sub-)millimeter spectral lines can be used not only to understand the chemical complexity and enrichment history of an observed portion of our Galaxy, but with spectrally resolved lines, they reveal the physical conditions, dynamics, and even the ionisation state and magnetic field strengths of the gas component of our Galaxy. They are prime tracers of mass assembly and structure formation across scales.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cosmic Dawn with PANORAMIC II: Cosmic Variance and Galaxy Clustering at $z\sim10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational campaigns with JWST have revealed a higher-than-expected abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, with various proposed theoretical explanations. A powerful complementary constraint to break degeneracies between different models is galaxy clustering. In this paper, we combine PANORAMIC pure parallel and legacy imaging along 34 independent sightlines to measure the cosmic variance ($\sigma_{\rm CV}$) in the number count of Lyman break galaxies at $z\sim10$ which is directly related to their clustering strength. We find $\sigma_{\rm CV}=0.96^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$, $1.46^{+0.54}_{-0.44}$, and $1.71^{+0.72}_{-0.59}$ per NIRCam pointing ($\sim9.7\,{\rm arcmin}^2$, $\lesssim1.5\,{\rm pMpc}$ at $z\sim10$) for galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}&lt;-19.5$, $-20$, and $-20.5$. Comparing to galaxies in the UniverseMachine, we find that $\sigma_{\rm CV}$ is consistent with our measurements, but that the number densities are a factor $\gtrsim5$ lower. We implement simple models in the UniverseMachine that represent different physical mechanisms to enhance the number density of UV-bright galaxies. All models decrease $\sigma_{\rm CV}$ by placing galaxies at fixed M$_{\rm UV}$ in lower mass halos, but they do so to varying degrees. Combined constraints on $\sigma_{\rm CV}$ and the UVLF tentatively disfavor models that globally increase the star formation efficiency (SFE) or the scatter in the M$_{\rm UV}$-$M_{\rm halo}$ relation, while models that decrease the mass-to-light ratio, or assume a power-law scaling of the SFE with $M_{\rm halo}$ agree better with the data. We show that with sufficient additional independent sightlines, robust discrimination between models is possible, paving the way for powerful constraints on the physics of early galaxy evolution through NIRCam pure parallel imaging.</description>

      <title>Connecting galaxies with their haloes -- from parsec to Mpc scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution is driven by processes occurring across a wide range of scales, from star formation within giant molecular clouds (parsec scales) to outflows and secular evolution across entire galaxies (kpc scales), and the interplay between galaxies, their dark matter haloes, and large-scale structures (Mpc scales). Connecting the distribution of baryonic matter and energy across these scales will remain one of the key challenges for both theoretical and observational astrophysics in the coming decade. A major development towards meeting this challenge has been the growing ability to obtain highly spatially resolved (parsec-scale) integral-field spectroscopic observations (e.g. with VLT/MUSE), as well as to probe the extremely low-surface brightness outskirts of galaxies at large radii and high vertical scale heights. To combine the two regimes, we need a paradigm shift in the way we do spectroscopy on galaxies, especially considering the ongoing and future photometric surveys. The next decade will also bring a revolution in extensive photometric surveys of large areas of the sky, uncovering low surface brightness features around nearby galaxies. However, to fully understand the processes that connect galaxies to their haloes, shape low surface brightness features, and drive secular evolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be essential. Here, we outline the need for wide-field spectroscopic observations of statistically significant samples of nearby galaxies and highlight the key questions that can only be addressed with such data</description>

      <title>Surveying Galaxy Clusters (in formation) in the Distant Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present-day galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the Universe, yet their early assembly remains poorly understood. At z$&gt;$2, clusters in formation span tens of Mpc and host gas-rich, dust-obscured galaxies embedded in extended, low-surface-brightness gaseous environments. Current (sub-)millimeter facilities lack the mapping speed, sensitivity, and contiguous field of view needed to trace the cold gas and dust driving rapid galaxy growth across such scales. A future large single-dish observatory with degree-scale coverage, broad spectral access, and high-multiplex capability would enable comprehensive and uniform mapping of entire protoclusters, revealing where star formation is triggered or quenched, and quantifying the cold gas budget, thus providing information on gas cooling within protocluster environments. In synergy with wide-sky optical/NIR surveys such as Euclid, LSST, and Roman, this facility would provide the missing multi-scale and multiphase submillimeter view needed to uncover how the stellar, gaseous, and dark-matter components assemble in protoclusters, completing our view of early structure formation.</description>

      <title>Bowshocks driven by the pole-on molecular jet of outbursting protostar SVS 13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflows play a key role in the star and planet formation processes. Some outflows show discrete clumps of cold molecular gas moving at extremely high velocities (EHVs) of $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$, known as ''molecular bullets'', that are likely closely associated with their primary driving agent. Here we present ALMA CO(J=3-2) observations of a bright EHV molecular bullet that reveal its morphology in detail down to scales of 30 au and its kinematic structure across the entire intermediate velocity range ($\sim$30-100 km s$^{-1}$). These provide important new insights into how outflows transfer mass and momentum to the surrounding medium. The observed channel maps display several sequences of ring-like features whose velocity increases and size decreases with projected distance from the driving source, each sequence tracing a thin, bow-shaped shell culminating on-axis in a bright EHV head. The shape, kinematics, and mass of each shell all agree remarkably well with the simplest textbook models of momentum-conserving bowshocks produced by a time-variable EHV jet. The dynamical timescale between consecutive shells is of a few decades, with the latest ejection event coinciding with the protostar optical/IR outburst observed in $\sim$1990. The very strong evidence for bowshock-driven entrainment induced by jet variability revealed by this work suggests that accretion bursts, and therefore variations in the disk snowlines, should occur on decade timescales, which could substantially impact grain growth and planet formation.</description>

      <title>A first systematic study of [OIII] 88$\mu$m at $z&gt;8$: two luminous oxygen lines and a powerful ionized outflow in the first 600 million years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep ALMA Band 7 observations of the [OIII] $88\mu$m line and underlying dust continuum emission in four UV-bright, gravitationally lensed (magnification $\mu = 1.4-3.8$), JWST-selected galaxies at $z = 8.5 - 10.3$, with observed magnitudes $-22.5 \lesssim M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -20.5$. [OIII] $88\mu$m is confidently detected in UNCOVER-10646 at $z=8.5080 \pm 0.0011$ ($15\sigma$) and DHZ1 at $z=9.3113 \pm 0.0005$ ($6\sigma$), with both being intrinsically luminous systems [$L_\mathrm{[OIII]} = (1.1 - 1.6) \times 10^9$ $L_\odot$] that follow the local [OIII]-SFR relation. [OIII] $88\mu$m remains undetected in the two $z&gt;10$ targets, including in the $z=10.07$ X-ray AGN UHZ1, where we obtain a deep limit of $L_\mathrm{[OIII]} &lt; 6 \times 10^7$ $L_\odot$. Dust emission is not detected in any individual source nor in a stack ($&lt;3\sigma$). The high S/N [OIII] $88\mu$m detection in UNCOVER-10646 uniquely reveals an additional broad component ($\mathrm{FWHM} = 1366_{-329}^{+473}$ $\mathrm{km/s}$; $\Delta\mathrm{BIC}\approx20$) indicative of an ionized outflow. We infer a high outflow rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{out} = 128_{-46}^{+80}$ $M_\odot\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, corresponding to a mass loading factor $\eta = \dot{M}_\mathrm{out}/\mathrm{SFR} = 2.9_{-1.0}^{+1.8}$ that is broadly consistent with theoretical predictions and JWST-based studies of ionized outflows at high redshift. While high-resolution ALMA follow-up is required to confirm the outflow, this first systematic study at $z&gt;8$ highlights the unique diagnostic power of [OIII] $88\mu$m in characterizing galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The role of mergers and rejuvenation in the buildup of the quiescent population at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quenching of galaxies using a mock observational lightcone generated from the Semi-Analytic Model (SAM) L-Galaxies, closely matched to observations from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS). The sample is used to study merging, rejuvenation, and visibility times for star-forming, quiescent, and post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, to assess the impact on the build-up of the passive galaxy mass functions.
  We find, for example, that a typical PSB ($M_\ast\sim10^{10}$\,M$_\odot$) at $z\approx1$ has a 15 per cent likelihood of merging and around a 25 per cent likelihood of rejuvenating within 1 Gyr of being identified. Applying these rates and timescales to the observational data, we estimate the fraction of quiescent galaxies that passed through a PSB phase. We find that $18 - 28$ per cent of the build-up in the massive end ($M_\ast&gt;10^{10}$\,M$\,_\odot$) of the passive mass function at $1&lt;z&lt;2$ can be explained by PSBs, with the contribution declining to $\sim5$ per cent by $z \simeq 0.5$. Accounting for mergers and rejuvenation reduces the inferred PSB contribution by approximately a factor of two. At lower stellar masses ($M_\ast &lt; 10^{10}$\,M$_\odot$), rapid quenching through a PSB phase explains a significantly larger fraction of the growth in the passive mass function. With a visibility time of $\sim$ 0.75 Gyr, we find that around $60-80$ per cent of low-mass passive galaxies underwent a PSB phase. Our findings provide further evidence that low- and high-mass galaxies follow different quenching pathways.</description>

      <title>Cluster properties as a function of dynamical state in the DESI Legacy x UNIONS surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the dynamical state of galaxy clusters influences their galaxy populations and mass distributions. Using photometrically selected clusters from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey cross-matched with the UNIONS galaxy shear catalogue, we classify clusters as evolved or evolving based on their rest-frame r-band magnitude gaps and stellar mass ratios between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and bright satellites. We measure the stellar mass functions, weak-lensing profiles, and radial number density and red-fraction profiles of stacked clusters in both subsamples. Evolved clusters exhibit more concentrated lensing profiles, bimodal stellar mass functions dominated by massive BCGs, and a deficit of intermediate-mass satellites, while evolving clusters show flatter central lensing signals and an excess of massive satellites. Applying the same selection to IllustrisTNG clusters reproduces these trends and links the observed differences to distinct mass accretion histories. These results demonstrate the close link between cluster galaxy populations and the overall dynamical state of their underlying dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>Radio emission in star-forming galaxies: connection to restarted or relic AGN activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing evidence shows that AGN with radio detections have more perturbed ionized gas kinematics and higher outflow detection rates, suggesting a link between radio emission and these processes. In galaxies with weak or ambiguous AGN signatures, some studies attribute the radio emission to star formation, while others propose AGN-driven winds or weak, unresolved jets as the dominant mechanism. To investigate this connection, we take a step back and analyze a sample of star-forming (SF) galaxies with no clear current AGN signatures. Using low-(LOFAR, 144MHz) and high-frequency (FIRST, 1.4GHz) surveys, combined with spatially resolved spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey, we compare SF galaxies with 144 MHz detections that either do or do not have GHz detections. Despite being matched in stellar mass, redshift, and radio (MHz) luminosity, GHz-detected SF galaxies systematically differ from their non-GHz-detected counterparts. The former display enhanced ionized gas-emission line widths, higher central outflow fractions, redder colors, increased central obscuration, and offset emission-line ratios that shift towards (or closer to) the AGN regime (in the [NII] BPT diagram). Furthermore, the non-GHz galaxies are likely undetected due to their extended radio morphologies, while the GHz-detected ones are significantly more radio compact. Most of the properties from the GHz-detected (compared to non-detected) remarkably resemble the behavior found in many studies of radio-detected AGNs. This suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms shaping GHz-detected SF galaxies properties are fundamentally similar. This raises intriguing questions about whether some compact SF galaxies represent a precursor phase of AGN evolution or a form of low-power AGN. The radio compact characteristic sizes of GHz-detected SF galaxies also suggest a connection between AGN and old starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>NGC 3521 as the Milky Way near twin: spectral energy distribution from UV to radio decameter ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milky Way analogues (MWAs) are usually selected from structural and kinematic properties, but robust SED-based similarity criteria are limited by heterogeneous photometry and incomplete wavelength coverage. We present a homogeneous, aperture-photometry SED of the Milky Way near-twin NGC~3521 from the ultraviolet to the radio decameter range. Fluxes are measured within a fixed elliptical isophotal aperture using GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer/MIPS, Herschel/PACS+SPIRE, and VLA data, and supplemented by meter/decameter constraints. We report new observations obtained in Jan-Feb 2022 with the Ukrainian T-shape radio telescope and derive, for the first time, an upper limit in the 24--32~MHz band. The UV-to-decameter SED (27 points) is modelled with \textsc{CIGALE}, including a dedicated low-frequency radio prescription (\texttt{radio_extra}) that accounts for emission and absorption effects. Using ZTF and NEOWISE data (2014--2025), we detect genuine nuclear variability; optical trends at $\sim2^{\prime\prime}$ primarily trace the compact nucleus, while NEOWISE variability reflects a mix of nuclear changes and warm-dust emission within the larger aperture. The preferred fit yields $M_\star \simeq 6.0\times10^{10},M_\odot$, ${\rm SFR}\simeq1.65,M_\odot,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $M_{\rm dust}\simeq1.3\times10^{8},M_\odot$, and an effective dust temperature of $\sim23$~K. The decameter constraint gives $S_{28,{\rm MHz}}&lt;11.22$~Jy, consistent with expectations for a Milky Way-like system placed at 10.7~Mpc. We conclude that an integrated, homogeneous SED, especially below 100~MHz, provides a complementary diagnostic for identifying and validating MWAs and for interpreting how Milky Way properties would appear to an external observer.</description>

      <title>1D stellar mergers: entropy sorting and PyMMAMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar multiple systems are the norm, not the exception, with many systems undergoing interaction phases during their lifetimes. A subset of these interactions can lead to stellar mergers, where the two components of a stellar binary system come close enough to coalesce into a single star. Accurately modeling stellar mergers requires computationally expensive 3D methods, which are not suited for exploring large parameter spaces as required e.g., by population synthesis studies. In this work, we compare two 1D prescriptions based on the concept of entropy sorting to their 3D counterparts. We employ a basic entropy sorting method ('ES'), which builds the merger remnant by sorting the progenitor stars' shells by increasing entropy, and a Python version of the 'Make Me A Massive Star' code ('PM'), which additionally applies a shock-heating prescription calibrated on SPH simulations of stellar head-on collisions. Comparing to a set of 39 more recent SPH head-on collisions different from the ones used for PM calibration, we find that PM reproduces the outcome of these mergers a lot better than ES in terms of thermal and composition structure post-merger.
  Both 1D methods produce remnants that are rejuvenated more strongly than expected for massive stars, indicating that increased amounts of hydrogen are being mixed into the core. In an effort to further improve PM, we introduce a scaling factor for the shock-heating. We compare 1D models with both down- and up-scaled heating to a 3D MHD $9 + 8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ merger of main-sequence stars. Decreasing the shock-heating improves the agreement in terms of the entropy profile, but has only a minor impact on the subsequent stellar evolution of the remnant. We find that 1D methods are able to approximate 3D stellar merger simulations well, and that shock-heating has to be considered to properly predict the post-merger structures.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of the Double Nucleus in NGC 4486B: Possible Evidence for a Recent Binary SMBH Merger and Recoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{BH}=3.6\pm0.7\times10^8$ (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q&gt;0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics.</description>

      <title>XID+PRIMA, II: Stepping Through Hyperspectral Imaging to Deblend PRIMAger Beyond the Extragalactic Confusion Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics concept aims to map large areas with spectral coverage and sensitivities inaccessible to previous FIR space telescopes, covering 25-235um. We synthesise images representing a deep imaging survey, with realistic instrumental and confusion noise, reflecting the latest PRIMAger instrument specifications. We present a new Bayesian modelling approach XID+stepwise that exploits PRIMAger's hyperspectral imaging to derive self-consistent, informative flux priors by sequentially propagating constraints from short to long wavelengths. With Euclid-like prior source positions, this method recovers fluxes to within 20% to 0.2-0.7 mJy across 45-84 um, which correspond to factors of 1.3-3.4 fainter than the confusion limit. For the most confusion-dominated channels, accurate fluxes are measured to 0.9, 2.5, 7.6 and 14.8 mJy at 92, 126, 183 and 235 um, respectively, which are factors of 3-5 better than the confusion limit. Using a deeper Euclid-based prior catalogue and weak ancillary flux priors at 25 um yields further improvements, reaching up to a factor ~7 fainter than the confusion limit at 96 um. Additionally, we demonstrate that positional priors from blind source detection followed by deblending via XID+ enables PRIMAger to achieve sensitivity beyond the confusion limits using PRIMAger data alone. We show that IR-luminous galaxies at z~2 are robustly detected in a large fraction of the PRIMAger channels (&gt;98% in 12 out of the 16 considered channels), providing dense sampling of the FIR SED even for sources several factors below the confusion limit. We explore the impact on our results for a range of systematic effects, including cirrus contamination, optical degradation, and calibration uncertainties. These findings indicate that confusion noise will not limit the key science from PRIMA extragalactic imaging surveys when employing XID+.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a differential formulation of the Loeb Scale that extends the original static framework into a radially evolving, real time classification scheme for interstellar objects. By promoting each anomaly metric to a function of heliocentric distance and introducing a relaxation equation for the effective score, our method incorporates memory, hysteresis and predictive capability. This allows us to have early, stable forecasts of an object's eventual Loeb level based on sparse data obtained at large distances, which is more helpful to quantify its true nature when near Earth.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiters in Old Wide-Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters (HJs) are giant planets with orbital periods shorter than $10$ days, found around $\sim 0.5$-$1\%$ of Sun-like stars. Their origins remain debated despite decades of study. The high prevalence of stellar companions, the eccentricity distribution of 'Cold' Jupiters on longer orbits, and the wide range of stellar spin-orbit misalignments support high-eccentricity migration: planets are excited to eccentric orbits and subsequently circularised via tidal dissipation. Existing high-eccentricity migration models, however, are inefficient in converting the initial population of Cold Jupiters to HJs. Current models reproduce at most $\lesssim 30\%$ of observed HJs, while the resulting Cold/Hot Jupiter ratios ($\gtrsim 30$) overproduce the observed values of $10$-$15$. These models also fail to form HJs around old stars ($\gtrsim 3$ Gyr) on short tidal decay timescales (e.g., $&lt;40$ Myr). Here we show that wide binaries ($a &gt; 10^3$ au) perturbed by the Galactic tidal field produce $1.8\pm 0.14$ more HJs compared to isolated binary systems, accounting for $26$-$40\%$ of the observed population under conservative assumptions. Wide-binaries predominantly produce Gyr-old systems, consistent with the host-age distribution for $t \ge 2.5\ \rm Gyr$. In $\sim 20\%$ of cases, wide-binary perturbations eject giant planets entirely, resolving the Cold/Hot Jupiter ratio discrepancy while naturally seeding the population of free-floating giant planets. In our dynamical framework, wide binaries emerge as active agents that reshape planetary demographics across billions of years. These results will be decisively tested by forthcoming exoplanet and microlensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical mass-loss rates for Very Massive Stars. I. Investigating the wind kink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation-driven winds are ubiquitous in massive stars, but in Very Massive Stars (VMSs), mass loss dominates their evolution, chemical yields, and ultimate fate. Theoretical predictions have often relied on extrapolations of O star prescriptions, likely underestimating true VMS mass-loss rates. In the first of a series of papers on VMS wind properties, we investigate a feature predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations: a mass-loss `kink' or upturn where the single-scattering limit is breached and winds transition from optically thin to optically thick. We calculate hydrodynamically consistent non-LTE atmosphere models using the PoWR$^\mathrm{HD}$ code, with a grid spanning $40-135M_\odot$ and 12-50 kK at fixed $\log(L_\star/L_\odot) = 6.0$ and solar-like metallicity with $Z=0.02$. Our models confirm the existence of the kink, where the wind optical depth crosses unity and spectral morphology shifts from O star to WNh types. The predicted location of the kink coincides with the transition stars in the Galactic Arches cluster and reproduces the model-independent transition mass-loss rate of $\log(\dot{M}_\mathrm{trans}) \approx -5.16$ from Vink &amp; Gr\"afener (2012). For the first time, we locate the kink at $\Gamma_\mathrm{e} \approx 0.43$ ($M_\star \approx 60M_\odot$) without relying on uncertain stellar masses. Above the kink, mass-loss rates scale much more steeply with decreasing mass (slope ~ 10), in qualitative agreement with MC predictions. We additionally identify two bistability jumps in the mass loss driven by Fe ionisation shifts: the first from FeIV to FeIII near 25 kK and the second from FeIII to FeII near 15 kK. Our models thus provide the first comprehensive confirmation of the VMS mass-loss kink while establishing a mass-loss relation with complex mass and temperature dependencies with consequences for stellar evolution, chemical yields, and the black hole mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds V. R-process dominates neutron capture elements production in the oldest SMC stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the chemical abundances of Fe, alpha- and neutron-capture elements in 12 metal-poor Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) giant stars, observed with the high-resolution spectrographs UVES/VLT and MIKE/Magellan. These stars have [Fe/H] between -2.3 and -1.4 dex, 10 of them with [Fe/H]&lt;-1.8 dex. According to theoretical age-metallicity relations for this galaxy, these stars formed in the first Gyr of life of the SMC and represent the oldest SMC stars known so far. [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios are enhanced but at a lower level than MW metal-poor stars, as expected according to the slow star formation rate of the SMC. The sample exhibits a large star-to-star scatter in all the neutron-capture elements. The two r-process elements measured in this work (Eu and Sm) have abundance ratios from solar up to +1 dex, three of them with [Eu/Fe]&gt;+0.7 dex and labeled as r-II stars. This [r/Fe] distribution indicates that the r-process in the SMC can be extremely efficient but is still largely affected by the stochastic nature of the main sites of production and the inefficient gas mixing in the early SMC evolution. A similar scatter is observable also for the s-process elements (Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd), with the stars richest in Eu also being rich in these s-elements. Also, all the stars exhibit subsolar [s/Eu] abundance ratios. At the metallicities of these stars, the production of neutron-capture elements is driven by r-process, because the low-mass AGB stars have not yet evolved and left their s-process signature in the interstellar medium. We also present stochastic chemical evolution models tailored for the SMC that confirm this scenario.</description>

      <title>Halo Lightcones with Optimised Orientation and Interpolation in Cosmological Simulations -- an application to mock H$\alpha$ selected galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical step to create realistic mock catalogs that support large-scale photometric and spectroscopic sky surveys is the production of cosmological simulations that accurately model the survey observables taking into account the redshift-dependent galaxy formation and evolution processes. Here we develop an efficient framework, HOLCon (Halo Optimised Lightcone Constructor), for post-facto construction of dark matter halo lightcones from simulations and use them to generate a mock galaxy catalogue. HOLCon includes a module to optimise the lightcone's orientation within the simulation box, minimising repeated structures when the survey volume exceeds a single box -- a common challenge in modern surveys. A linear interpolation scheme tracks the evolution of halo properties across snapshots. Applied to the publicly available Uchuu simulation, we construct a lightcone of 50 ${\rm deg}^2$ and extending up to $z = 10$, providing representative coverage of deep fields of Stage IV surveys. We validate the lightcone for cosmological applications by comparing the dark matter halo clustering in the lightcone with those from the original simulation snapshots. Subsequently, we make the galaxy-halo connection on the lightcone with a redshift extended version of the SciPIC algorithm producing a comprehensive set of descriptive galaxy attributes. HOLCon leverages Dask, a scalable parallel computing pythonic framework for fast construction of dark matter halo lightcones enabling rapid creation of multiple statistical realizations essential for robust cosmological inference. The produced galaxy mock makes predictions for clustering of H$\alpha$ emitters, making it a useful cosmology resource.</description>

      <title>How Mass Flows Through Accretion Discs: A Spectral-Timing Vision for the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how mass and angular momentum flow through accretion discs remains a fundamental unsolved problem in astrophysics. Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Spirals and Vertical Motions in the Planet-Forming Disk around HD 100546. A multi-line study of its gas kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HD100546 represents a particularly interesting target to study dynamical planet-disk interactions as various features have been observed in both the dust and gas that provide direct and indirect evidence for ongoing planet formation. In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk.</description>

      <title>A high-dynamic-range view of the growth of structure and the warm/hot Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryons heat to temperatures above $&gt;\!\!10^5\,\mathrm{K}$ as they accrete onto massive overdensities -- galaxies, groups, clusters, and filaments -- where they ionize and become optically transparent. Deep mm-wave observations such as those with ALMA have begun to probe a handful ($\sim\,$4) of massive systems at $z\!\sim\!2-4$, while low-resolution mm-wave surveys have detected thousands of objects at arcminute resolution out to $z\!\approx\!2$. To truly advance the field of the evolution of large-scale structures, mapping the warm/hot distribution of ionized gas out to the redshift of their formation, the ESO community requires a large-aperture single-dish (sub-)mm telescope. This will need to provide several orders of magnitude higher mapping speeds than currently available while preserving the few arcsecond resolution required for imaging the gas and removing contaminating radio and dusty thermal signals across the full (sub-)mm wavelength range.</description>

Abstract: Extensive rovibrational line lists are constructed for 12 isotopologues of carbon dioxide: $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O, $^{17}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, and $^{17}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O. The variational program TROVE was employed together with an exact kinetic energy operator, accurate empirical potential energy surface (Ames-2) and the ab initio dipole moment surface Ames-2021-40K. Empirical energy levels from the most recent MARVEL analyses, as well as from the HITRAN and CDSD databases, are used to replace calculated values where available. The line lists are further supplemented by assigning AFGL quantum numbers using machine-learning based estimators. The resulting data were employed to generate opacities with four radiative transfer codes, TauREx, ARCiS, NEMESIS, and petitRADTRANS, both for individual isotopologues and for CO$_2$ at terrestrial isotopic natural abundance. All line lists and associated data are available at www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Catalogs of optically-selected clusters and photometric luminous red galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program final year dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct samples of optically-selected clusters and photometric luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program final year dataset covering $\sim 1200$~deg$^2$. The cluster catalogs extend out to the redshift of $1.38$ and contain more than 10000 clusters with richness larger than $15$, where the richness is defined to be a membership probability weighted number of galaxies above the stellar masses of approximately $10^{10.2}M_\odot$. The total number of probable red cluster member galaxies in these clusters are more than $6\times 10^5$. Photometric redshifts of the clusters are shown to be precise with the scatter better than $\sim 0.01$ for a wide redshift range. We detect stacked weak lensing signals of clusters out to the redshift of $1$, and use them to update constraints on the mass-richness relation. Our catalog of about 6 million photometric LRGs extend out to the redshift of $1.25$, and have the scatter of the photometric redshift better than $\sim 0.02$ for the redshift range between $0.4$ and $1.0$.</description>

      <title>Any Light Particle Searches with ALPS II: first science results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light-shining-through-a-wall experiment ALPS II at DESY in Hamburg searched for axions and similar lightweight particles in its first science campaign from February to May 2024. No evidence for the existence of such particles was found. For pseudoscalar bosons like the axion, with masses below about 0.1 meV, we achieved a limit for the di-photon coupling strength of 1.5e-9 1/GeV at a 95% confidence level. This is more than a factor of 20 improvement compared to all previous similar experiments. We also provide limits on photon interactions for scalar, vector and tensor bosons. An achievement of this first science campaign is the demonstration of stable operation and robust calibration of the complex experiment. Currently, the optical system of ALPS II is being upgraded aiming for another two orders of magnitude sensitivity increase.</description>

      <title>A Bridge between Young Stars Formed by Gravitational Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of stars are born in clustered environments. In these environments, close encounters between young stars with planet-forming disks are expected to occur frequently. However, direct evidence of such interactions remains rare. Here, we report clear signatures of a recent dynamical interaction between the young stellar systems L1448 IRS3A and L1448 IRS3B. Millimeter wavelength observations reveal a distinct, tidally stripped bridge between the two systems. Together with previously reported spiral arm structures at the outer edge of the IRS3A disk and at the inner and outer regions of the IRS3B disk, these features imply that the systems are undergoing a dynamical flyby. Hydrodynamical simulations reproduce these features and suggest that the closest approach occurred about 15,000 yr ago. These findings offer rare insight into how stellar interactions can reshape disk structures and influence the formation of young multiple stellar systems.</description>

Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) is our unique laboratory to test star formation theories at the level of individual stars, serving as the Rosetta Stone to interpret extragalactic observations. The proposed White Paper focuses on the following key questions regarding the structure and evolution of the MW traced by young stellar populations: Q1. How do large-scale dynamical instabilities, like warps and vertical waves, drive the star formation of the Galactic thin disk? Q2. Do star-forming regions form stochastically, driven by local self-propagating feedback, or are they triggered by a common dynamical process acting on Galactic scales? Do internal feedback loops and external interactions tend to sustain or quench star formation in the MW? Q3. Are the clustered star-forming regions the only environments where stars form, or can stars also form in more diffuse structures such as the stellar strings?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform searches for gravitational wave memory in the data of two major Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments located in Europe and Australia. Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are the primary sources of gravitational waves in PTA experiments. We develop and carry out the first search for late inspirals and mergers of these sources based on full numerical relativity waveforms with null (nonlinear) gravitational wave memory. Additionally, we search for generic bursts of null gravitational wave memory, exploring possibilities of reducing the computational cost of these searches through kernel density and normalizing flow approximation of the posteriors. We rule out the mergers of SMBHBs with a chirp mass of 10^10 Solar Mass up to 700 Mpc over 18 years of observation at 95% credibility. We rule out the observation of generic displacement memory bursts with strain amplitudes &gt; 10^-14 in brief periods of the observation time but across the sky, or over the whole observation time but for certain preferred sky positions, at 95%$credibility.</description>

      <title>Genuine Retrieval of the AGN Host Stellar Population (GRAHSP)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assembly and co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their host galaxy stellar population is a key open questions in galaxy evolution. Stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), are inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED). For galaxies triggering SMBH activity, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contaminates the light at all wavelengths, hampering the inference of galaxy parameters. Incomplete AGN templates can lead to systematic overestimates of the stellar mass, biasing our understanding of AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This challenge has gained further impetus with the advent of sensitive wide-area surveys with millions of luminous AGN, including by eROSITA, Euclid and LSST. We aim to estimate the accuracy and bias of AGN host galaxy parameters and improve upon existing techniques. This work makes two contributions: 1) a new SED fitting code, GRAHSP, with a flexible, empirically motivated AGN model including a power law continuum emission lines, a FeII forest and a flexible infrared torus. We verify that our model reproduces published X-ray to infrared SEDs of AGN to better than 20\% accuracy. A fully Bayesian fit with nested sampling includes uncertainties in the model and the data, making the inference highly robust. 2) we created a benchmark photometric dataset where pure quasars are merged with non-AGN pure galaxies into a hybrid (Chimera) object but with known galaxy and AGN properties. Comparing the true and retrieved $M_\star$, SFR and AGN luminosities shows that previous codes systematically over-estimate $M_\star$ and SFR by 0.5 dex with a wide scatter of 0.7 dex, at AGN luminosities above 10^44 erg/s. In contrast, GRAHSP shows no bias on $M_\star$ and SFR. GRAHSP also estimates more realistic uncertainties. GRAHSP enables characterization of the environmental conditions conducive to black hole growth. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at $z &gt; 5$ using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the $\rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}}$ relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Bar ages derived for the first time in nearby galaxies: Insights on secular evolution from the TIMER sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Once galaxies settle their discs and become self-gravitating, stellar bars can form, driving the subsequent evolution of their host galaxy. Determining the ages of bars can therefore shed light on the epoch of the onset of secular evolution. In this work, we apply the first broadly applicable methodology to derive bar ages to a sample of 20 nearby galaxies. The method is based on the co-eval build-up of nuclear structures and bars and involves using IFS data from the MUSE instrument on VLT to disentangle the SFH of the nuclear disc from the background population. This allows us to derive the formation epoch of the nuclear disc and, thus, of the bar. We estimate the bar formation epoch of nearby galaxies - mostly from the TIMER survey-, creating the largest sample of galaxies with known bar ages to date. We find bar formation epochs between 1 and 13 Gyr ago, illustrating how disc-settling and bar formation are processes that first took place in the early Universe and are still taking place in some galaxies. We infer the bar fraction over cosmological time with our sample, finding remarkable agreement with that obtained from direct studies of galaxies at high redshifts. Additionally, for the first time, we can investigate secular evolution processes taking into account the ages of bars. Our results agree with the scenario in which bars aid the quenching of the host galaxy, with galaxies hosting older bars tending to be more "quenched". We also find that older bars tend to be longer, stronger, and host larger nuclear discs. Furthermore, we find evidence of the nuclear disc stellar mass build-up over time. On the other hand, we find no evidence of downsizing playing a role in bar formation, since we find that bar age is independent of galaxy stellar mass. With the means to estimate bar ages, we can begin to understand better when and how bars shape the observed properties of disc galaxies.</description>

      <title>The dynamical lineage of ultra-diffuse galaxies from TNG50-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) continues to remain a puzzle. Similarities and differences in the morphological and the kinematical properties of the UDGs with their possible precursors, namely low-surface brightness (LSBs), L*-type high-surface brightness (HSBs) and dwarf galaxies, may provide crucial constraints on their origin and evolution. We selected samples of UDGs, LSBs, HSBs and dwarfs from TNG50-1. We first obtained a few possible scaling relations involving some mass properties to analyse if the regression fits for UDGs are in compliance with those of the other samples. Then, we studied individual galaxy cutouts to evaluate the intrinsic shapes of their dark-matter (DM) and stellar components, orbital and kinematical properties related to their stellar velocity dispersion. Finally, we constructed the mock IFU data using the SimSpin code to extract the stellar kinematic moment maps. We observe that the UDGs and the dwarf galaxies have nearly similar regression fits in a. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs gas mass, b. stellar-to-gas mass ratio vs total dynamical mass, c. stellar central surface density vs ratio of stellar-to-total dynamical mass, and d. total baryonic mass vs total dynamical mass parameter spaces. Next, we find that the isolated UDGs are prolate rotators similar to the dwarf population, while the tidally-bound UDGs can exhibit both prolate and oblate-rotating shapes. The DM and stellar velocity anisotropy properties of the UDGs suggest that they reside in a cored, dwarf-like halo and may be classified by early-type galaxies. Finally, the stellar kinematic properties suggest that both the UDGs and the dwarfs are slow-rotators having low to nearly no-rotations in contrast to the late-type, disc-dominated, fast-rotating LSBs and HSBs. Therefore, we may conclude that the UDGs and the dwarfs possibly have a common dynamical lineage.</description>

      <title>Lord of LRDs: Insights into a "Little Red Dot" with a low-ionization spectrum at z = 0.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a puzzling population of optically red and compact galaxies with peculiar "V"-shaped spectra at high redshift, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs are found at $z&gt;4$ and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early stages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at $z=0.1$, which shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early Universe, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of 1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation of this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K giant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH molecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines potentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is observed in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII] emission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in a JWST-selected LRD at $z=2.26$. We find small but statistically significant variability in the H$\alpha$ of SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 consistent with previous findings. Finally, we report new observations with NuSTAR. We confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of this LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{24}~{\rm cm^{-2}}$. All evidence suggests SDSS J102530.29+140207.3 has a complex gaseous environment and the strong ionic, atomic, and molecular absorptions are hard to explain with typical stellar and AGN models.</description>

      <title>Alpha effect and dynamo in density-stratified turbulence with large-scale shear: applications to protoplanetary discs and astrophysical clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A joint effect of the density-stratified turbulence (or inhomogeneous turbulence) and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers results in the $\alpha$ effect and mean-field dynamo action. These effects also produce the effective pumping velocity of a large-scale magnetic field. Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions to the $\alpha$ tensor caused by the joint effect of inhomogeneity of turbulence and a large-scale shear. The isotropic part of the $\alpha$ tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field that is proportional to the product of the fluid density gradient and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity caused, e.g., by collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. Applications of these effects to protoplanetary discs, proto-galactic and proto-stellar clouds are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies in the MATLAS Survey: Hubble Space Telescope observations of nuclear star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dwarf galaxies, nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are believed to primarily form from the migration and merger of globular clusters (GCs), with a possible contribution from in-situ star-forming activity triggered by gas infall. We present the study of NSCs in 41 MATLAS survey dwarf galaxies including ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), as part of a large follow-up imaging program with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) using the F606W and F814W filters. The sample is biased towards low-surface brightness and large dwarfs, i.e., UDG-like galaxies, and includes two galaxies with a double nucleus, 13 newly identified nucleated dwarfs thanks to HST's high spatial resolution, and five candidate ultra-compact dwarf progenitors. We modeled the NSCs with a S\'ersic profile and derived their structural properties and photometry. We find the NSC S\'ersic index to increase with the luminosity and stellar mass, while no obvious trend is seen on the effective radius and ellipticity. The faint NSCs tend to have a constant color profile, whereas the bright ones have a bluer center, suggesting that the most massive NSCs in our sample might have experienced a mixed formation scenario, including in-situ star formation. A significant portion of our NSCs tend to be more massive than for other galaxy samples of similar stellar mass, which could be due to some dwarfs ongoing tidal disruption or an initial formation of massive NSCs from multiple GC mergers and in-situ star forming activity. More observations of resolved NSC are needed to be able to infer their formation scenario from the structural properties and photometry in dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: Constraining Chemical Enrichment Pathways at Cosmic Noon with Argon Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present argon abundances from a sample of 46 star-forming galaxies at $z=2-3.5$ from the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-Optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) program. Although argon is an $\alpha-$element produced by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), the latest supernova yield models suggest additional argon production and enrichment by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), unlike other $\alpha-$elements such as oxygen. To study the relationship between argon and oxygen abundances, we construct two median-stacked composite spectra for separate $z=2.0-2.6$ and $z=2.8-3.5$ redshift bins, presenting more representative measurements than previous samples that require individual detection of faint lines. Abundance ratios were determined using an empirical calibration based on the strength of the [ArIII]$\lambda7137$ emission line relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5008$ emission line. With this calibration, we estimate argon abundances (Ar/O) of $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 2.26$ bin and $0.42^{+0.12}_{-0.11}\mbox{(Ar/O)}_{\odot}$ for the $\langle z \rangle = 3.15$ bin, suggesting minimal SNe Ia and dominant CCSNe enrichment in this sample. Comparison of our abundance measurements of $z\sim 2-3$ AURORA galaxies with chemical evolution modeling of Milky Way stars shows consistency with the Milky Way Bulge component, suggesting a rapid star-formation timescale. However, even larger samples of actively star-forming galaxies with available argon abundances, as well as comparisons between argon abundance and other critical galaxy properties (e.g., sSFR) and models (e.g., one tuned specifically to this redshift range) are needed to draw stronger conclusions on the role of argon in galactic chemical enrichment at Cosmic Noon.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Tests of Dark Matter Self-Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) arises generically in scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Model that have dark sectors with light mediators or strong dynamics. The self-interactions allow energy and momentum transport through halos, altering their structure and dynamics relative to those produced by collisionless dark matter. SIDM models provide a promising way to explain the diversity of galactic rotation curves, and they form a predictive and versatile framework for interpreting astrophysical phenomena related to dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of the physical effects of dark matter self-interactions in objects ranging from galactic satellites (dark and luminous) to clusters of galaxies and the large-scale structure. The second major part describes the methods used to constrain SIDM models including current constraints, with the aim of advancing tests with upcoming galaxy surveys. This part also provides a detailed review of the unresolved small-scale structure formation issues and concrete ways to test simple SIDM models. The review is rounded off by a discussion of the theoretical motivation for self-interactions, degeneracies with baryonic and gravitational effects, extensions to the single-component elastic-interactions SIDM framework, and future observational and theoretical prospects.</description>

      <title>Hints of Primordial Magnetic Fields at Recombination and Implications for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs), long studied as relics of the early Universe, accelerate recombination and have been proposed as a way to relieve the Hubble tension. However, previous studies relied on simplified toy models. Here we use recent evaluations of recombination with PMFs, incorporating full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and detailed Lyman-alpha radiative transfer, to test PMF-enhanced recombination ($b\Lambda$CDM) against observational data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae (SN). Focusing on non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum, we find a preference for present-day total field strengths of approximately 5-10 pico-Gauss. Depending on the dataset combination, this preference ranges from mild ($\sim 1.8\sigma$ with Planck + DESI) to moderate ($\sim 3\sigma$ with Planck + DESI + SH0ES-calibrated SN) significance. The $b\Lambda$CDM has Planck + DESI $\chi^2$ values equal to or better than $\Lambda$CDM while predicting a higher Hubble constant. Future high-resolution CMB temperature and polarization measurements will be crucial for confirming or further constraining PMFs at recombination. Field strengths of 5-10 pico-Gauss align closely with those required for cluster magnetic fields to originate entirely from primordial sources, without the need for additional dynamo amplification.</description>

      <title>Misspecification-robust amortised simulation-based inference using variational methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.</description>

      <title>The HITRAN2024 methane update</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version. After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 80,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 51,000 transition wavenumbers, 18,000 line intensities, 33,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3300 assignments. 44,000 new lines were added with 16,000 old lines removed, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote sensing instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, speed-independent pressure broadening parameters of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were gathered and used to fit Pad\'e-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadening parameters were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.</description>
