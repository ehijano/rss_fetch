      <title>On the Theory of Quantum and Towards Practical Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing exposes the brilliance of quantum mechanics through computer science and, as such, gives oneself a marvelous and exhilarating journey to go through. This article leads along that journey with a historical and current outlook on quantum computation that is geared toward computer experts but also to experts from other disciplines as well. It is an article that will bridge the vast gap between classical and quantum computation and open an entering wedge through which one will be able to both bring himself up to speed on quantum computation and, intrinsically, in a straightforward manner, become acquainted with it. We are indeed in luck to be living in an age where computing is being reinvented, and not only seeing history in the making firsthand but, in fact, having the opportunity to be the ones who are reinventing--and that is quite a thought.</description>
