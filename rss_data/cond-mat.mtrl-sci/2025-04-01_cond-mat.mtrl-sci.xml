      <title>Symmetry-Informed Graph Neural Networks for Carbon Dioxide Isotherm and Adsorption Prediction in Aluminum-Substituted Zeolites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting adsorption properties in nanoporous materials using Deep Learning models remains a challenging task. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when attempting to generalize to structures that were not part of the training data.. In this work, we introduce SymGNN, a graph neural network architecture that leverages material symmetries to improve adsorption property prediction. By incorporating symmetry operations into the message-passing mechanism, our model enhances parameter sharing across different zeolite topologies, leading to improved generalization. We evaluate SymGNN on both interpolation and generalization tasks, demonstrating that it successfully captures key adsorption trends, including the influence of both the framework and aluminium distribution on CO$_2$ adsorption. Furthermore, we apply our model to the characterization of experimental adsorption isotherms, using a genetic algorithm to infer likely aluminium distributions. Our results highlight the effectiveness of machine learning models trained on simulations for studying real materials and suggest promising directions for fine-tuning with experimental data and generative approaches for the inverse design of multifunctional nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>The Chirality of Phonons: Definitions, Symmetry Constraints, and Experimental Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons with nonzero angular momentum (AM), also referred to as chiral phonons, have garnered increasing attention in recent studies. Many existing experimental/theoretical works identify chiral phonons based on pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) or the flipping of the polarization of the circularly polarized light (CPL) in the Raman scattering process. However, the accuracy and universality of these assumptions remain to be verified. Moreover, in condensed matter physics, symmetry strongly governs the scattering and interactions of phonons, quasi-particles, and external fields, profoundly affecting correlated physical phenomena. In this study, we first conduct an in-depth examination of the distinctions and interconnections among AM, PAM, helicity, and atomic motion--key characteristics inherent to chiral phonons--and then undertake a comprehensive study of phonon chirality, as well as their associated physical quantities, and experimental benchmarks under various magnetic point groups. By developing the symmetry-based framework for phonon chirality across magnetic point groups, we demonstrate that identifying chiral phonons solely through nonzero PAM or CPL polarization inversion is inadequate, challenging prior findings. This framework clarifies the relationship between symmetry and phonon chirality, revealing that phonon modes governed by different symmetries exhibit distinct experimental signatures, thereby advancing our understanding of these phenomena. Finally, experiments on five materials with distinct symmetries are conducted to validate our theoretical results. Supported by both theoretical rigor and experimental validation, our study represents a significant step forward in advancing research on symmetry-constrained phonons.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Potentials for Hydrogen Absorption in TiCr$_2$ Laves Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energetics of hydrogen absorption in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ Laves phases is investigated for $0 &lt; x \le 6$ with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The MLIPs are trained with configurations generated through a series of active-learning schemes. Basin-hopping Monte Carlo (BHMC) simulations based on the MLIPs predict minimum-energy hydrogen configurations, along with enthalpies of formation and hydrogen orderings. The obtained phase transformations at 0 K agree well with the experiments at low temperatures. The hydrogen solubility limits in the low-concentration $\alpha$ phases at 0 K are predicted to be $x = 1.0$ and $x = 1.5$ for the C15 and the C14 phases, respectively. At these concentrations, C15 TiCr$_2$H shows the $Cc$ monoclinic symmetry, while C14 TiCr$_2$H$_{1.5}$ shows the $Ama2$ orthorhombic symmetry, both of which have not been reported for this system. The first and the second hydride phases, i.e., $\beta$ and $\beta'$, at 0 K are found around $x = 3$ and $x = 4$, respectively, for both the C15 and the C14 phases. In the second-hydride $\beta'$ phases, C15 TiCr$_2$H$_4$ shows the $I4_1/a$ tetragonal symmetry, while C14 TiCr$_2$H$_4$ shows the $R\bar3c$ rhombohedral symmetry. Hydrogen repulsion are found to extend to edge-sharing interstices, affecting the hydrogen ordering. Furthermore, the $6h_2$ A$_2$B$_2$ interstices are found to be energetically substantially more preferable for C14 TiCr$_2$H$_x$ than the other A$_2$B$_2$ interstices at low hydrogen concentrations, influencing the hydrogen-occupation trend.</description>

      <title>Nanocrystal tuned ammonia gas sensing technique via impedance spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia is a harmful chemical hazard known for its widespread industrial use. Exposure to ammonia can cause environmental damage, human health hazards, and huge economic losses. Therefore, ammonia gas sensors are essential for detecting ammonia leaks to avoid serious accidental injury and death. In this study, we synthesize a nanostructured (WO3) n-type metal oxide semiconductor doped with a rare earth element-transition metal (Ce-Cu) via hydrothermal method for ammonia gas sensing application. Structural analysis was performed using XRD and FESEM. Further we investigate the optical properties via UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR, and PL. We found that doping of (Ce-Cu) led to significant improvement in thermal stability for ammonia detection and selectivity performance compared to that pure one, across a wide frequency range. We believe that these studies will pave the way for exploring the use of Ce-Cu to improve the gas sensing properties of semiconductor-based gas sensors.</description>

      <title>Structural stability, elemental ordering, and transport properties in layered ScTaN2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some ternary TM nitrides are predicted to adopt layered structures that make them interesting for thermoelectric conversion and quantum materials applications. Synthesis of TM ternary nitride films by physical vapor deposition often favors disordered 3D structures rather than the predicted 2D-like layered structure. In this study, we investigate the structural interplay in the Sc-Ta-N material system, focusing on ScTaN2. We use a two-step combinatorial approach to deposit Sc-Ta-N films by RF co-sputtering and then process the resulting 3D-structured precursor with RTA. Synchrotron GIWAXS on films annealed at 1200 {\deg}C for 20 min reveals the nucleation of the layered structure (P63/mmc) within a composition window of Sc/(Sc+Ta) = 0.2-0.5. Analyzing the strong (002) superstructure reflection near 1:1:2 stoichiometry, indicative of long-range ordering, we estimate that 13.6% antisite defects are present in stoichiometric films. Interestingly, we find that the structure can accommodate large off-stoichiometry in the Ta-rich region (x &lt; 0.5), facilitated by making an alloy with the nearly isostructural Ta5N6 compound that exists on a composition tie-line. Transport measurements on ScTaN2 reveal a nearly temperature-independent high carrier density (1021 cm-3), suggesting a heavily doped semiconductor or semimetallic character. The carrier mobility is relatively small (9.5 cm2V-1s-1 at 2 K) and the residual-resistivity ratio is small, suggesting that electrical conduction is dominated by defects or disorder. Measured magnetoresistance is indicative of weak antilocalization at low temperatures. We highlight the interplay between ScTaN2 and Ta5N6 in stabilizing layered structures, emphasizes the importance of cation order/disorder for potential tunable alloys, and suggests that ScTaN2 is promising platform for exploring electronic properties in a tie line of stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Synthesis-related nanoscale defects in Mo-based Janus monolayers revealed by cross-correlated AFM and TERS imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for various applications in non-linear optics, energy harvesting, and catalysis. These materials are usually synthesized via chemical conversion of pristine TMDs. Nanometer-scale characterization of the obtained Janus materials' morphology and local composition is crucial for both the synthesis optimization and the future device applications. In this work, we present a cross-correlated atomic force microscopy (AFM) and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) study of Janus $\mathrm{Mo}_{\mathrm{Se}}^{\mathrm{S}}$ and Janus $\mathrm{Mo}_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{Se}}$ monolayers synthesized by the hydrogen plasma-assisted chemical conversion of $\mathrm{MoSe}_2$ and $\mathrm{MoS}_2$, respectively. We demonstrate how the choice of the growth substrate and the starting TMD affects the morphology of the resulting Janus material. Furthermore, by employing TERS imaging, we demonstrate the presence of nanoscale islands (~20 nm across) of $\mathrm{MoSe}_2$-$\mathrm{Mo}_{\mathrm{Se}}^{\mathrm{S}}$ ($\mathrm{MoS}_2$-$\mathrm{Mo}_{\mathrm{S}}^{\mathrm{Se}}$) vertical heterostructures originating from the bilayer nanoislands in the precursor monolayer crystals. The understanding of the origins of nanoscale defects in Janus TMDs revealed in our study can help with further optimization of the Janus conversion process towards uniform and wrinkle-/crack-free Janus materials. Moreover, our work shows that cross-correlated AFM and TERS imaging is a powerful and accessible method for studying nanoscale composition and defects in Janus TMD monolayers.</description>

      <title>Development of a Capacitance Measurement for Pulsed Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capacitance measurements are crucial for probing the electrical properties of materials. In this study, we develop and implement a capacitance measurement technique optimized for pulsed magnetic fields. Our approach employs an auto-balancing bridge method, leveraging a high-bandwidth transimpedance amplifier to mitigate parasitic contributions from coaxial cables. This technique enables precise capacitance measurements in rapidly changing magnetic fields, as demonstrated in experiments on the magnetoelectric material NiCo$_{2}$TeO$_{6}$. The results reveal strong magnetoelectric coupling, including a pronounced hysteresis in capacitance that coincides with magnetization measurements and an enhanced energy dissipation peak at high sweep rates. Compared to traditional LCR meter measurements in DC fields, our method exhibits excellent agreement while providing additional insight into field-induced phase transitions. This work establishes a robust methodology for capacitance measurements in extreme conditions and opens new opportunities for studying multiferroic and correlated electron systems under high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>External-field-induced altermagnetism in experimentally synthesized monolayer $\mathrm{CrX_3}$ (X=Cl, Br and I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Net-zero-magnetization magnets are attracting significant research interest, driven by their potential for ultrahigh density and ultrafast performance. Among these materials, the altermagnets possess alternating spin-splitting band structures and exhibit a range of phenomena previously thought to be exclusive to ferromagnets, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, non-relativistic spin-polarized currents, and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Bulk altermagnets have been experimentally identified, while two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets remain experimentally unexplored. Here, we take experimentally synthesized 2D ferromagnetic $\mathrm{CrX_3}$ (X=Cl, Br and I) as the parent material and achieve altermagnetism through external field. First, we achieve the transition from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism through biaxial strain. Subsequently, we break the space inversion symmetry while preserving the mirror symmetry via an electric field, thereby inducing altermagnetism. Moreover, through the application of Janus engineering to construct $\mathrm{CrX_{1.5}Y_{1.5}}$ (X$\neq$Y=Cl, Br and I), the phase transition from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism induced by strain alone is sufficient to trigger the emergence of altermagnetism. All six monolayers possess the symmetry of $i$-wave spin-splitting. The computational results suggest that $\mathrm{CrCl_3}$ can be readily tuned to exhibit altermagnetism through external field in experiment, thanks to its low strain threshold for magnetic phase transition. Our work provides experimentally viable materials and methods for realizing altermagnetism, which can advance the development of 2D altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Extremely high excitonic $g$-factors in 2D crystals by alloy-induced admixing of band states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayers (MLs) of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (\mbox{S-TMDs}) emit light very efficiently and display rich spin-valley physics, with gyromagnetic ($g$-) factors of about -4. Here, we investigate how these properties can be tailored by alloying. Magneto-optical spectroscopy is used to reveal the peculiar properties of excitonic complexes in Mo$_{x}$W$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ MLs with different Mo and W concentrations. We show that the alloys feature extremely high $g$-factors for neutral excitons, that change gradually with the composition up to reaching values of the order of -10 for $x \approx 0.2$. First-principles calculations corroborate the experimental findings and provide evidence that alloying in S-TMDs results in a non-trivial band structure engineering, being at the origin of the high $g$-factors. The theoretical framework also suggests a higher strain sensitivity of the alloys, making them promising candidates for tailor-made optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Tailoring spin reorientation and magnetic interaction for room-temperature spintronics in Tb-Doped SmFeO3 single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective doping with different R-site ions in rare-earth perovskite RFeO3 compounds offers an effective way to achieve atomic-scale tuning of the complex exchange interactions. In this study, the spin reorientation temperature of Tb-doped SmFeO3 (Sm0.7Tb0.3FeO3) single crystal is lowered to approximately 350 K, making it more suitable for room-temperature applications. Notably, the magnetic compensation point is absent at low temperatures, and both R3+ and Fe3+ ion moments can be fully saturated under high magnetic fields, suggesting that Tb3+ doping drives the R3+ and Fe3+ sublattices toward ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, the hysteresis loop along the a-axis transitions from a double triangle shape below the spin reorientation temperature to a rectangular shape above the spin reorientation temperature, and the nucleation field exhibits a strong dependence on both the measurement temperature and the maximum applied magnetic field. Above results can be explained by a modified two-domain model with mean field correction. The results of magnetic domain measurements indicate that the emergence of the double-triangular hysteresis loop is jointly determined by domain wall motion and the nonlinear response of the parasitic magnetic moment along the a-axis. These findings provide valuable insights and new materials for advancing the use of RFeO3 compounds in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Importance of bond exchange in MnC structural stability and half-metallic ferromagnetism: a comprehensive density functional benchmark study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a first successful synthesis of the unknown bulk manganese monocarbide (MnC) has been reported. Suggested as a potential superhard material, the compound is found to crystallize in the zincblende (B3) structure. In the present work, we report an exhaustive density functional investigation on structural, electronic and magnetic properties of MnC, using different levels of exchange-correlation approximations. We show that SCAN meta-GGA and PBE0r hybrid functional outperform GGA-PBEsol, HSE06 hybrid functional and the mean field DFT+$U$+$V$; in predicting correctly the experimental zincblende structure as the groundstate one. It is demonstrated that the bond exchange plays a crucial role in this stabilization. At theoretical equilibrium, hybrid functionals (PBE0r and HSE06) lead to a metallic behavior of MnC. Semilocal ones (PBEsol and SCAN) and mean field DFT+$U$+$V$, however, predict two opposite kinds of half-metallic ferromagnetism; opening a debate on the origin and the nature this behavior. If the latter is confirmed experimentally, MnC could be for importance as a spintronic material.</description>

      <title>TCSP 2.0: Template Based Crystal Structure Prediction with Improved Oxidation State Prediction and Chemistry Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction remains a major challenge in materials science, directly impacting the discovery and development of next-generation materials. We introduce TCSP 2.0, a substantial evolution of our template-based crystal structure prediction framework that advances predictive capabilities through synergistic integration of several key techniques into its major components. Building upon TCSP 1.0's template-matching foundation, this enhanced version implements three critical innovations: (1) replacement of Pymatgen with deep learning-based BERTOS model for oxidation state prediction with superior performance, (2) implementation of sophisticated element embedding distance metrics for improved chemical similarity assessment, and (3) development of a robust majority voting mechanism for space group selection that reduces prediction uncertainty. TCSP 2.0 also expands its template base by incorporating template structures from Materials Cloud, C2DB, and GNoME databases alongside the original Materials Project repository, creating a more comprehensive structural foundation. Rigorous validation across 180 diverse test cases of the CSPBenchmark demonstrates TCSP 2.0's exceptional performance, achieving 83.89% space-group success rate and 78.33% structural similarity accuracy for top-5 predictions, substantially outperforming both its predecessor and the competing modern CSP algorithms including CSPML and EquiCSP.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric control of spin helicity and nonreciprocal charge transport in a multiferroic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23261v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiferroic state with both electric polarization ($P$) and magnetization ($M$) shows the inherently strong $P$-$M$ coupling, when $P$ is induced by cycloidal (N\'eel-wall like) spin modulation. The sign of $P$ is determined by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, we report the current-induced magnetoelectric control of the multiferroics in a helimagnetic metal YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment $T \sim P \times M \sim (\hat{q} \times \chi_v) \times M$ as well as with the magneto-chirality $\chi_v \times M$, where $\hat{q}$ and $\chi_v$ being the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. We furthermore observe an enhancement of NRR by the spin-cluster scattering via $\chi_v$ and its fluctuation. These findings may pave a way to exploration of multiferroic conductors and application of the spin-helicity degree of freedom as a state-variable.</description>

      <title>VacHopPy: A Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale modeling, which integrates material properties from ab initio calculations into device-scale models, is a promising approach for optimizing semiconductor devices. However, a key challenge remains: while ab initio methods yield diffusion parameters specific to individual migration paths, device models require a single set of effective parameters that capture overall diffusion. To bridge this gap, we present VacHopPy an open-source Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). VacHopPy extracts an effective set of parameters for vacancy hopping: hopping distance, hopping barrier, number of effective paths, correlation factor, and jump attempt frequency, by statistically integrating thermodynamic, kinetic, and geometric contributions across all hopping paths. It also offers tools for tracking vacancy trajectories and for detecting phase transitions in AIMD simulations. The applicability of VacHopPy is demonstrated in three materials: face-centered cubic Al, rutile TiO2, and monoclinic HfO2. The effective parameters accurately reflect temperature-dependent diffusion behavior and show good agreement with previous experimental observations. Expressed in a simplified form suitable for device models, these parameters remain valid across a broad temperature range spanning several hundred Kelvins. Furthermore, our findings highlight the critical role of anisotropic thermal vibrations in overall diffusion, a factor frequently overlooked in other frameworks but inherently considered in VacHopPy. Overall, VacHopPy provides a robust framework for bridging atomistic and device-scale models, enabling more reliable multiscale simulations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Surface Composition Characterization of Thin-Film Materials Libraries using Multi-Output Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of surface compositions across high-dimensional materials spaces is critical for accelerating the discovery of surface-dominated functional materials. While X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy allows detailed surface composition investigation, it remains a time-intensive technique. In this work, it is demonstrated that Gaussian process regression can be used to accurately predict surface compositions from rapidly acquired volume composition data obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, drastically reducing the number of required surface measurements. As a proof of principle, an exemplary system, the oxide Mg-Mn-Al-O, is synthesized as a composition-spread thin-film materials library and analyzed by high-throughput methods. We show that the surface composition of the entire library can be predicted with an accuracy of 96% with only 13 measurements, reducing the total measurement time by 277 h. This is a scalable and data-efficient solution for integrating surface analysis into materials discovery workflows.</description>

      <title>POINT$^{2}$: A Polymer Informatics Training and Testing Database</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of polymer informatics has been significantly propelled by the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques, enabling the rapid prediction of polymer properties and expediting the discovery of high-performance polymeric materials. However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric training of multiferroic domains in Mn$_2$GeO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the trilinear magnetoelectric coupling between ferroelectric, ferromagnetic, and antiferromagnetic domains in the spin-spiral multiferroic Mn$_2$GeO$_4$, imaging the evolution of domains under both magnetic and electric fields via optical second harmonic generation. Once activated, this trilinear coupling enables the highly repeatable inversion of an inhomogeneous ferroelectric domain pattern upon global reversal of the magnetization. We specifically consider the initial domain evolution from zero-field cooling and find that polarization and magnetization domains form independently when entering the multiferroic phase. From here, a field training process is required to obtain the domain inversion mentioned above. We explain this training behavior of the complex magnetoelectric coupling as a pathway from metastable to equilibrium domain patterns, a process relevant to understanding the magnetoelectric behavior in other multiferroic materials with highly interlinked coexisting order parameters.</description>

      <title>Modeling Framework to Predict Melting Dynamics at Microstructural Defects in TNT-HMX High Explosive Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many high explosive (HE) formulations are composite materials whose microstructure is understood to impact functional characteristics. Interfaces are known to mediate the formation of hot spots that control their safety and initiation. To study such processes at molecular scales, we developed all-atom force fields (FFs) for Octol, a prototypical HE formulation comprised of TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) and HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine). We extended a FF for TNT and recasted it in a form that can be readily combined with a well-established FF for HMX. The resulting FF was extensively validated against experimental results and density functional theory calculations. We applied the new combined TNT-HMX FF to predict and rank surface and interface energies, which indicate that there is an energetic driver for coarsening of microstructural grains in TNT-HMX composites. Finally, we assess the impact of several microstructural environments on the dynamic melting of TNT crystal under ultrafast thermal loading. We find that both free surfaces and planar material interfaces are effective nucleation points for TNT melting. However, MD simulations show that TNT crystal is prone to superheating by at least 50 K on sub-nanosecond timescales and that the degree of superheating is inversely correlated with surface and interface energy. The modeling framework presented here will enable future studies on hot spot formation processes in accident scenarios that are governed by strong coupling between microstructural interfaces, material mechanics, momentum and energy transport, phase transitions, and chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Heteroanionic compounds, which contain two or more types of anions, have emerged as a promising class of materials with diverse properties and functionalities. In this paper, I review the experimental findings on Ca3ReO5Cl2 and related com-pounds that exhibit remarkable pleochroism and novel quantum magnetism. I discuss how the heteroanionic coordination affects the optical and magnetic properties by modulating the d-orbital states of the transition metal ions and then compare these materials with other heteroanionic and monoanionic compounds and highlight the potential of A3MO5X2 materials for future exploration of materials and phenomena.</description>

      <title>Topological Electronic Structure and Transport Properties of the Distorted Rutile-type WO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elucidate the transport properties and electronic structures of distorted rutile-type WO2. Electrical resistivity and Hall effect measurements of high-quality single crystals revealed the transport property characteristics of topological materials; these characteristics included an extremely large magnetoresistance of 13,200% (2 K and 9 T) and a very high carrier mobility of 25,700 cm2 V-1 s-1 (5 K). First-principles calculations revealed Dirac nodal lines (DNL) near the Fermi energy in the electronic structure when spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) were absent. Although these DNLs mostly disappeared in the presence of SOIs, band crossings at high-symmetry points in the reciprocal space existed as Dirac points. Furthermore, DNLs protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry persisted on the ky = {\pi}/b plane. The unique transport properties originating from the topological electronic structure of chemically and thermally stable WO2 could represent an opportunity to investigate the potential electronic applications of the material.</description>

      <title>Colossal enhancement of spin transmission through magnon confinement in an antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Felix Bloch's introduction of the concept of spin waves in 1930, magnons (the quanta of spin waves) have been extensively studied in a range of materials for spintronics, particularly for non-volatile logic-in-memory devices. Controlling magnons in conventional antiferromagnets and harnessing them in practical applications, however, remains a challenge. In this letter, we demonstrate highly efficient magnon transport in an LaFeO$_3$/BiFeO$_3$/LaFeO$_3$ all-antiferromagnetic system which can be controlled electrically, making it highly desirable for energy-efficient computation. Leveraging spin-orbit-driven spin-charge transduction, we demonstrate that this material architecture permits magnon confinement in ultrathin antiferromagnets, enhancing the output voltage generated by magnon transport by several orders of magnitude, which provides a pathway to enable magnetoelectric memory and logic functionalities. Additionally, its non-volatility enables ultralow-power logic-in-memory processing, where magnonic devices can be efficiently reconfigured via electrically controlled magnon spin currents within magnetoelectric channels.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Weak Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a realistic model relevant to La$_2$CuO$_4$ and other altermagnetic perovskite oxides, we study interrelations between weak ferromagnetism (WF), anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and net orbital magnetization (OM). All of them can be linked to the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Nevertheless, while spin WF is induced by the DM vector components having the same sign in all equivalent bonds, AHE and OM are related to alternating-sign components, which do not contribute to any canting of spins. The microscopic model remains invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t} \}$, combining the shift ${\bf t}$ of antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices to each other with the spin flip $\mathcal{S}$. Thus, the band structure remains Kramers-degenerate, but the time-reversal symmetry is broken, providing a possibility to realize AHE in antiferromagnetic substances. The altermagnetic splitting of bands, breaking the $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t}\}$ symmetry, does not play a major role in the problem. More important is the orthorhombic strain, responsible for finite values of AHE and OM.</description>

      <title>Efficient defect healing of single-walled cabron nanotubes through $ \mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{2} $-assisted multiple-cycle treatment with air exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) degrade their mechanical,electrical, and thermal properties, limiting their potential applications. To realize the diverse applications of SWCNTs, it is essential to enhance their crystallinity through effective defect healing. However, traditional thermal treatments typically require temperatures above 1800{\deg}C, which can alter the nanotube structure. Previously, defect healing of SWCNTs was achieved at a relatively low temperature of 1100{\deg}C, using C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ assistance, but the efficiency was limited. In this study, we developed a C$_{2}$H$_{2}$-assisted multiple-cycle process at an even lower temperature of 1000{\deg}C combined with air exposure, achieving highly efficient defect healing while preserving the nanotube structure. The combination of multiple-cycle treatment and air exposure between cycles was found to promote defect activation, suppress the formation of amorphous carbon, and enhance the effectiveness of defect healing. Additionally, we successfully healed commercially available bulk-scale SWCNTs (super-growth SWCNTs), noting that their healing behavior differed from lab-grown SWCNTs with smaller diameters synthesized from nanodiamond. The efficient and structure-preserved healing process developed in this study broadens the potential applications of high-quality SWCNTs, including flexible electronics, high-performance composites, and energy storage devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors offer a promising platform for advancing quantum technologies due to their localized energy states and controllable spin properties. Prior research has focused on a limited set of defects within materials such as diamond, silicon carbide, and hexagonal boron nitride. We present a high-throughput study to systematically identify and evaluate point defects across a diverse range of host materials, aiming to uncover previously unexplored defects in novel host materials suitable for use in quantum applications. A range of host materials are selected for their desirable properties, such as appropriate bandgaps, crystal structure, and absence of d- or f-electrons. The Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) software framework is used to generate vacancies, substitutions with s- and p-elements, and interstitials in these materials and use density functional theory to calculate key properties such as Zero-Phonon Lines (ZPLs), ionic displacements, Transition Dipole Moments (TDMs), and formation energies. Special attention is given to charge correction methods for materials with dielectric anisotropy. We uncover new defect-host combinations with advantageous properties for quantum applications: 28 defects across 11 isotropic and 2 anisotropic host materials show properties similar to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Beryllium (Be) substitutional defects in SrS, MgS, and SrO emerge as particu- larly promising. These findings contribute to diversifying and enhancing the materials available for quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polymorphism and mechanism of helium compounds is crucial for understanding the physical and chemical nature of He-bearing materials under pressures. Here, we predict two new types of He-bearing compounds, MgHe and MgnHe (n = 6, 8, 10, 15, 18), being formed above 750 GPa by unbiased ab initio structure search. An unexpected bandgap is opened up in MgHe at as low as around 200 GPa. This is the first case of noble gas driven metal-nonmetal transition in all elements. The same mechanism is demonstrated also being applicable to other metallic elements, and making beryllium transform into a non-metallic state, a triumph that is impossible otherwise. Furthermore, the stability of the simple cubic phase of Mg (Mg-sc) is greatly enhanced by mixing with He, which lowers the critical pressure of pure Mg-sc from about 1.1 TPa down to 750 GPa to form ordered substitutional alloying phase of MgnHe on a simple cubic lattice of Mg. This is the first report on Mg-based noble gas substitutional alloy, in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that He preferring interstitial sites. The observed striking influences of He demonstrate the rich physics and chemistry of He-bearing compounds under ultra-high pressures.</description>

      <title>Can a ferroelectric diode be a selector-less, universal, non-volatile memory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in silicon foundry-process compatible ferroelectric (FE) thin films have reinvigorated interest in FE-based non-volatile memory (NVM) devices. Ferroelectric diodes (FeDs) are two-terminal NVM devices exhibiting rectifying current-voltage hysteretic characteristics that enable self-selecting designs critical for high-density memory. We examine progress in FeDs based on CMOS-compatible HZO, AlScN, and emerging van der Waals ferroelectrics. While FeDs demonstrate promising ON/OFF ratios and rectification capabilities, they face persistent challenges including limited write-cycling endurance, elevated operating voltages, and insufficient read currents. We provide materials-focused strategies to enhance reliability and performance of FeDs for energy-efficient electronic memory applications, with emphasis on their unique self-rectifying capabilities that eliminate the need for selector elements in crossbar arrays for compute in memory applications.</description>

      <title>First-Principle Investigation On Chromium Decorated Graphene-based Systems for Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sorbent materials like Cr decorated 2D materials are explored among its storage options. 2D material like graphene has been used as it has a high surface to volume ratio. A comparative study is done with Cr adsorbed in defect-free and single vacancy defect graphene systems. Ab-initio calculations are performed with and without Van der Waals interaction to check the hydrogen storage efficiency. Efficiency is determined by calculating the binding energy of the system. The preferred range for binding energy for reversible hydrogen storage, as determined by the Department of Energy, US, is between 0.2-0.6 eV. This work also visualizes the thermal stability spectrum of the efficient materials at 300 K using molecular dynamics calculations, predicting their stability at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of UGe$_2$ at ambient pressure: comparison with X-ray photoemission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on experimental crystallographic data, electronic structure of UGe$_2$ have been calculated and compared with our results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. We employed two different advanced full potential (FP) methods: FP-local-orbital (FPLO) and FP-linear augmented plane waves (Wien2k) codes for non-magnetic and ferromagnetic states. Starting from the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) or generalised gradient approximation (GGA), we verified either the orbital polarisation (OP) correction or the GGA+U approach for the U 5f-electrons, changing Coulomb-repulsion energies U in the range 0-4 eV. Satisfying agreement was achieved between experimental and our calculated magnetic moments using ab-initio LSDA+OP and non-ab-initio GGA+U approaches, the latter for realistic U values of 2-3 eV. We proved by the LSDA+OP approach an existence of the Fermi surface nesting vector along the a axis, possibly responsible for the triplet superconducting pairing. The calculated data reveal predominantly an itinerant U 5f-electron character of bands near the Fermi level, EF, with only small contributions from the U 6d and Ge 4p states. The experimental XPS spectrum of valence bands (VB) also contains the sharp main 5f-electron peak at EF, a wide hump (around -2 eV), and broad small peaks at higher energies. In the calculated XPS spectrum, the width of the main 5f-electron peak varies between 0.8 and 1.4 eV, depending on a method used in computations, but the hump remains unresolved. A newly observed asymmetric 1-eV satellite in the experimental 4f-core XPS spectrum together with known 3-eV and 7-eV satellites suggest dual behaviour of U-5f-electrons in UGe$_2$, the feature is inferred also from the VB studies.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Low Temperature Phase of FAPbI$_3$ using Machine-Learned Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FAPbI$_3$ is a material of interest for its potential in solar cell applications, driven by its remarkable optoelectronic properties. However, the low-temperature phase of FAPbI$_3$ remains poorly understood, with open questions surrounding its crystal structure, octahedral tilting, and the arrangement of formamidinium (FA) cations. Using our trained machine-learned potential in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a detailed investigation of this phase, uncovering its structural characteristics and dynamical behavior. Our analysis reveals the octahedral tilt pattern and sheds light on the rotational dynamics of FA cations in the low temperature phase. Strikingly, we find that the FA cations become frozen in a metastable configuration, unable to reach the thermodynamic ground state. By comparing our simulated results with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, we demonstrate good agreement, further validating our findings. This phenomenon mirrors experimental observations and offers a compelling explanation for the experimental challenges in accessing the true ground state. These findings provide critical insights into the fundamental physics of FAPbI$_3$ and its low-temperature behavior, advancing our understanding of this technologically important material.</description>

      <title>Simplified Cofactor Conditions for Cubic to Tetragonal, Orthorhombic, and Monoclinic Phase Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cofactor Conditions (CCs) are geometric compatibility conditions mathematically derived from the crystallographic theory of martensitic phase transformation. The CCs guarantee compatible interfaces between the austenite and the parallelled twin of the martensite with any volume fraction, yielding a wide range of microstructures during phase transformation. In recent times, CCs have demonstrated tremendous applications in the rational design of low hysteresis/fatigue shape memory alloys and shape memory ceramics. In this paper, we present a simplified form of the CCs for Type I/II twins using the eigenspace of transformation stretch tensor and twin axes. We further show the explicit forms and visualizations of the simplified CCs for Cubic to Tetragonal, Cubic to Orthorhombic, and Cubic to Monoclinic I/II phase transformations. The simplified form has revealed a more straightforward correlation between the lattice parameters and the CCs, and thus provides a more convenient tool for the rational design of phase-transforming materials.</description>

      <title>Ambient and high pressure studies of structural, electronic and magnetic properties of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ single crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thorough study of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ single crystals, which were grown from Sn flux, was performed using both bulk (heat capacity, ac susceptibility, dc magnetization, electrical resistivitivity, magnetoresistance) and microscopic (M\"ossbauer spectroscopy) techniques. Electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility were measured also under high pressure conditions (up to 19 GPa and 9.5 GPa, respectively). Further insight into electronic properties and phonons is provided by ab initio calculations. The results indicate that EuZn$_2$P$_2$ is an antiferromagnet with strong Eu-Eu exchange coupling of ferromagnetic type within the basal plane and weaker antiferromagnetic interaction along the c axis. The Eu magnetic moments are tilted from the basal plane. Hydrostatic pressure strongly affects both magnetic (increase of the N\'eel temperature) and electronic (suppression of the band gap and semi metallic behavior) properties, indicating a strong interplay of structure with magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of europium-based crystals containing As or P by a flux method: attempts to grow EuAgP single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europium-based materials are highly attractive due to their diverse range of physical properties. In these studies, we aimed to synthesize single crystals of the potentially topological semimetallic compound EuAgP, which up to this day has only been obtained in polycrystalline form. The flux method was employed for the syntheses, using fluxes such as: Bi, Sn, Pb, and In, in their various ratios. The purpose of using Bi flux was to try synthesizing an analog of EuAgAs single crystals, by fully substituting arsenic with phosphorus. The obtained crystals were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Despite many unsuccessful attempts to synthesize EuAgP single crystals, the study provides valuable insights into how different fluxes and their ratios influence the final synthesis product. It also underscores the complexity of designing analogs between arsenides and phosphides.</description>

      <title>The structure and topology of an amorphous metal-organic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous metal-organic frameworks are an important emerging materials class that combine the attractive physical properties of the amorphous state with the versatility of metal-organic framework (MOF) chemistry. The structures of amorphous MOFs have largely been inferred by drawing analogies to crystalline polymorphs and inorganic glasses, but ultimately the validity of such structural models has been challenging to establish either experimentally or computationally. Here we use a unified data-driven approach, combining experimental scattering data and active machine learning for interatomic potentials, to determine the structure of an amorphous zeolitic imidazolate framework (a-ZIF) -- the canonical amorphous MOF. Our results reveal clear differences between the structure of a-ZIF and that of other amorphous tetrahedral networks, allowing us to invalidate the long-standing assumption that these inorganic and hybrid glasses are topologically equivalent. To this end, we introduce a systematic notation for the network topology of amorphous solids, building a bridge to the successful use of topology analysis in crystalline MOFs and to materials informatics. Our work provides insights into the structure and topology of the archetypal amorphous MOF and opens up new avenues for modelling and understanding amorphous framework materials more generally.</description>

      <title>Harnessing uncertainty when learning through Equilibrium Propagation in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a supervised learning algorithm that trains network parameters using local neuronal activity. This is in stark contrast to backpropagation, where updating the parameters of the network requires significant data shuffling. Avoiding data movement makes EP particularly compelling as a learning framework for energy-efficient training on neuromorphic systems. In this work, we assess the ability of EP to learn on hardware that contain physical uncertainties. This is particularly important for researchers concerned with hardware implementations of self-learning systems that utilize EP. Our results demonstrate that deep, multi-layer neural network architectures can be trained successfully using EP in the presence of finite uncertainties, up to a critical limit. This limit is independent of the training dataset, and can be scaled through sampling the network according to the central limit theorem. Additionally, we demonstrate improved model convergence and performance for finite levels of uncertainty on the MNIST, KMNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Optimal performance is found for networks trained with uncertainties close to the critical limit. Our research supports future work to build self-learning hardware in situ with EP.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth of KTiOAsO4 by pulsed laser deposition for nonlinear frequency conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twin photons and triple photons generations require pump laser intensities of several hundred Mega Watts per square centimeter. Micrometer sized crystalline waveguides allow such interactions to be achieved at relatively low energies by taking advantage of the confinement of light. The materials selected to achieve these phenomena in the present work are from the titanyl phosphate family. The chosen architecture is a micrometric layer of KTA grown on a KTP substrate forming a planar waveguide in a first step. These two isostructural materials have a low lattice parameter mismatch, making it possible to achieve high quality epitaxial growth. The refractive index of KTA being higher than that of KTP, this couple of materials could allow light to be guided in the deposited layer. To grow the KTA film, the chosen technique is pulsed laser deposition (PLD) that allows nonlinear complex oxides layer of optical quality to be grown. In this study, we show that the growth is well oriented for layers with a thickness up to 200 nm after deposition. Then, after annealing, the crystal state is improved as well as the surface. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of KTA epitaxy over KTP by PLD with good epitaxial quality, good orientation and theoretical phase-matching conditions for a planar KTA waveguide.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Assisted Random Lasing of Perovskite Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random lasing occurs as the result of coherent optical feedback from random scattering centers. Plasmonic nanostructures, such as silver or gold nanoparticles, efficiently scatter light due to the formation of hot spots and optical confinement at the nanoscale. In this work, using silver nanocubes as highly efficient light scattering centers, a broad band plasmon assisted lasing action of halide perovskite materials is demonstrated. By embedding silver nanocubes in CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 solutions, narrow bandwidth lasing modes with a full width at half-maximum of approximately 1 nm are supported. It is observed that the lasing thresholds of perovskites are different for glass and gold substrates, and for different nanocube concentrations. Results of time-resolved measurements indicate a significant shortening in the decay time of the emission at above the lasing threshold, implying a stimulated emission process. The results of this work thus provide a pathway to generate coherent light sources from widely studied perovskite materials.</description>

      <title>Magneto transport of pressure induced flatbands in large angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle ($\sim 1.1^\circ$), leading to strong electron correlations and emergent quantum phases such as superconductivity and correlated insulating states. However, beyond the magic angle, the band structure generally remains dispersive, diminishing interaction-driven phenomena. In this work, we explore the equivalence between pressure-induced flatbands and the magic-angle flatband in large-angle TBG by systematically analyzing the role of interlayer coupling modifications under perpendicular pressure. We show that pressure-induced flatbands exhibit spatial localization similar to magic-angle TBG, with charge density concentrated in the AA-stacked regions. Furthermore, the Hall conductivity and magneto-transport properties under an external magnetic field reveal that these pressure-induced flatbands share key signatures with the quantum Hall response of magic-angle TBG. The obtained Hofstadter spectrum shows four consistent low-energy gaps across all twist angles under pressure, which align with the calculated Hall conductivity plateaus. Our findings suggest that pressure offers an alternative pathway to engineer flat electronic bands and correlated states in TBG, extending the landscape of tunable moir\'e materials beyond the constraints of the magic angle.</description>

      <title>Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for polymer property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</description>

      <title>Coupling molecular spin qubits with 2D magnets for coherent magnon manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnonics is an emerging field widely considered as a paradigm shift in information technology that uses spin waves for data storage, processing and transmission. However, the coherent control of spin waves in 2D magnets still remains a challenge. Herein, we investigate the interplay between molecular spins and magnons in hybrid heterostructures formed by [CpTi(cot)] and VOPc spin qubits deposited on the surface of the air-stable 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr using first principles. Our results show that different molecular rotation configurations significantly impact on qubit relaxation time and alter the magnon spectra of the underlying 2D magnet, allowing the chemical coherent control of spin waves in this material. We predict the feasibility of an ultrafast magnon-qubit interface with minimized decoherence, where exchange coupling plays a crucial role. This work opens new avenues for hybrid quantum magnonics, enabling selective tailoring through a versatile chemical approach.</description>

      <title>Controlling Competing Feedback Mechanisms for Programmable Patterns via Nonlinear Laser Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, the demonstrated structures are relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the previously unknown coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of top-down nanofabrication techniques.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in High-Entropy Antimonide M$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$Sb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-entropy concept was applied to the synthesis of transition-metal antimonides, M1-xPtxSb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir). High-entropy antimonide samples crystallized in a pseudo-hexagonal NiAs-type crystal structure with a P63/mmc space group were successfully synthesized through a conventional solid-state reaction and subsequent quenching. A detailed investigation of the composition and equilibration conditions confirmed the reversible phase transition between a multi-phase state at low temperature and an entropy-driven single-phase solid solution at high temperatures. Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements of single-phase M1-xPtxSb (x = 0.2) samples revealed a bulk superconducting transition at 2.15(2) K. This study demonstrates that the high-entropy concept provides numerous opportunities for the discovery of new functional materials such as superconductors.</description>

      <title>Paramagnetic half-moon shaped diffuse scattering arising from 3D magnetic frustration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use spin dynamics simulations to determine the origin of the unusual correlated diffuse scattering, characterised by half-moon shapes bridging the magnetic Bragg peaks, observed in the polarised elastic neutron scattering from manganese tungstate, MnWO\textsubscript{4}. We first fit a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve nearest-neighbour exchange interactions and single-ion anisotropy to the experimental ground-state magnon dispersion. We then show via spin dynamics simulations that our model Hamiltonian both reproduces the experimentally observed half-moon features and captures their persistence into the paramagnetic regime. Moreover, we identify the three-dimensional, competing antiferromagnetic interactions driving this behavior. Our work complements earlier studies of half-moon-shaped signatures in pyrochlore and triangular structures, by providing insight into their origin in a zigzag chain geometry with three-dimensional competing exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Force-Free Molecular Dynamics Through Autoregressive Equivariant Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific research. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural, dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps, generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than 4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An open-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under https://github.com/IBM/trajcast.</description>

      <title>Light-Driven Skyrmion Crystal Generation in Plasmonic Metasurfaces Through the Inverse Faraday Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological structures defined by a winding vector configuration that yields a quantized topological charge. In magnetic materials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them at the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts unlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale. Exploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds immense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report the generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold nanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while counterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This interplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all optical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales offers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Strain effects in a directly bonded diamond-on-insulator substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. In this study, we investigate strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO2/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of ~0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of ~0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Effect of Interlayer Stacking on the Electronic Properties of 1$T$-TaS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled stacking of van der Waals materials is a powerful tool for exploring the physics of quantum condensed matter. Given the small binding between layers, exploitation for engineering will require a breakthrough in stacking methodology, or an ability to take advantage of thicker defective stacks. Here we describe computational groundwork for the latter, using -- on account of its promise for cold memory applications -- 1$T$-TaS$_2$ as a model system. Comparing recursive Hendricks-Teller calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to published X-ray diffraction data, we obtain the key parameters describing the random stacking in mesoscopic flakes. These then regulate the electronic structures via specification of the random stacks in dynamical mean-field theory simulations. Hubbard repulsion induces strongly correlated metallic, band and Mott insulating layers, providing compelling evidence that electronic properties follow from the coexistence of more than the metallic and insulating planes associated by ordinary band theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of particulate composites derived from ultradense stealthy hyperuniform sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) many-particle systems are distinguished by a structure factor that vanishes not only at zero wavenumber (as in ``standard'' hyperuniform systems) but also across an extended range of wavenumbers near the origin. We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\chi$ and packing fractions $\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent advances in low-temperature electronic thermal transport properties of thermally biased superconductor heterostructures focusing on the two-terminal transport. Since the last decade, ferromagnetism has been widely used to enhance the thermoelectricity in heterostructures based on ordinary superconductors. The possibility of getting giant thermoelectric effects with optimum thermal conductance by breaking the electron-hole symmetry of the ordinary superconductor boosted the research in this direction. Recently, attention has been paid to the role of triplet Cooper pairs that emerged in ferromagnetic junctions and the possibility of advanced applications. Other forms of magnetism, specifically antiferromagnetism and altermagnetism, have been investigated to unravel the behavior of the thermal and charge current in thermally biased junctions. In parallel to ordinary superconductors, junctions with unconventional superconductors have been explored for the same purpose. Thermal transport in superconducting bilayers has been studied using advanced materials like Dirac and topological materials, including Weyl semimetals. Significant attention has been paid to thermally biased topological Josephson junctions to explore the phase-tunable current in recent times. Weyl Josephson junctions, multi-terminal Josephson junctions, and various other multilayer junctions have also been studied to engineer large thermoelectric effects and various functionalities with potential applications in superconductor-based thermal device components.</description>

      <title>Solute Co-Segregation Mechanisms at Low-Angle Grain Boundaries in Magnesium: A Combined Atomic-Scale Experimental and Modeling Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solute segregation at low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) critically affects the microstructure and mechanical properties of magnesium (Mg) alloys. In modern alloys containing multiple substitutional elements, understanding solute-solute interactions at microstructural defects becomes essential for alloy design. This study investigates the co-segregation mechanisms of calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), and aluminum (Al) at a LAGB in a dilute AZX010 Mg alloy by combining atomic-scale experimental and modeling techniques. Three-dimensional atom probe tomography (3D-APT) revealed significant segregation of Ca, Zn, and Al at the LAGB, with Ca forming linear segregation patterns along dislocation arrays characteristic of the LAGB. Clustering analysis showed increased Ca-Ca pairs at the boundary, indicating synergistic solute interactions. Atomistic simulations and elastic dipole calculations demonstrated that larger Ca atoms prefer tensile regions around dislocations, while smaller Zn and Al atoms favor compressive areas. These simulations also found that Ca-Ca co-segregation near dislocation cores is energetically more favorable than other solute pairings, explaining the enhanced Ca clustering observed experimentally. Thermodynamic modeling incorporating calculated segregation energies and solute-solute interactions accurately predicted solute concentrations at the LAGB, aligning with experimental data. The findings emphasize the importance of solute interactions at dislocation cores in Mg alloys, offering insights for improving mechanical performance through targeted alloying and grain boundary engineering.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Assisted Nanosecond stochastic operation in perpendicular superparamagnetic tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a good agreement between mean dwell times measured in 50~nm diameter, perpendicularly magnetized superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (SMTJ), and theoretical predictions based on Langer's theory. Due to a large entropic contribution, the theory yields Arrhenius prefactors in the femtosecond range for the measured junctions, in stark contrast to the typically assumed value of 1~ns. Thanks to the low prefactors, and fine-tuning of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, we report measured mean dwell times as low as 2.7~ns under an in-plane applied field at negligible bias voltage. Under a perpendicular applied field, we predict a Meyer-Neldel compensation phenomenon, whereby the prefactor scales like an exponential of the activation energy, in line with the exponential dependence of the measured dwell time on the field. We further predict the occurrence of (sub)nanosecond dwell times as a function of effective anisotropy and junction diameter at zero bias voltage. These findings pave the way towards the development of ultrafast, low-power, unconventional computing schemes operating by leveraging thermal noise in perpendicular SMTJs, which can be scaled down below 20~nm.</description>

Abstract: We elucidated the core structure of screw dislocations in ordered B2 FeCo using a recent magnetic bond-order potential (BOP) [Egorov et al., Phys. Rev. Mater. 7, 044403 (2023)]. We corroborated that dislocations in B2 FeCo exist in pairs separated by antiphase boundaries. The equilibrium separation is about 50 A, which demands large-scale atomistic simulations - inaccessible for density functional theory but attainable with BOP. We performed atomistic simulations of these separated dislocations with BOP and predicted that they reside in degenerate core structures. Also, dislocations induce changes in the local electronic structure and magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Wrinkling instability of 3D auxetic bilayers in tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilayers, soft substrates coated with stiff films, are commonly found in nature with examples including skin tissue, vesicles, and organ membranes. They exhibit different types of instabilities when subjected to compression, depending on the contrast in material properties between the two components. In this work, we unravel the mechanisms behind wrinkling instabilities in auxetic bilayer systems under uniaxial tension. We find that a soft bilayer in tension can experience significant lateral contraction, and with sufficient contrast in Poisson ratios, compressive stresses may induce wrinkles aligned with the tensile direction. We analytically model the onset of wrinkles and validate our predictions using Finite Element simulations in ABAQUS. Our findings reveal that wrinkles occur when the Poisson ratio of the substrate is greater than that of the film. As the two Poisson ratios converge to a common value, the critical stretch for instability shoots up rapidly and the wrinkles disappear. We also confirm these results through asymptotic analysis. Using inverse analysis, we design film microstructures to achieve desired effective Poisson ratios and further validate the effective properties with the Finite Element code FEAP. We show that the critical stretch ratio for buckling in auxetic structures with microstructural patterns is in strong agreement with the homogenized model predictions. The proposed method has significant potential for controlling surface patterns in auxetic skin grafts and hydrogel organ patches under mechanical loads. Moreover, the asymptotic expressions for compressible bilayers developed in this work can also be applied under finite strain for buckling-based metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a multiply hydrogenated polymer of phenalenyl tessellation molecules (PTMs), spatially overlapping zero modes appear, and three spin-aligned electron spins per PTM are generated through direct exchange interactions in the strongly correlated electron system. This interaction was used to design a two-dimensional (2D) $S = 3/2$ Heisenberg spin system on a honeycomb lattice. Simulations of the electronic structure using density functional theory with the Wannierization method revealed an array of nonbonding molecular orbitals (zero modes) in the hydrogenated nanographene structure. Our analysis of the onsite interaction strength indicated that each zero mode was half-filled with a spin-active electron owing to electron correlation effects. The low-energy subspace of the resulting zero mode-tight-binding model suggests the formation of a 2D antiferromagnetic $S = 3/2$ Heisenberg system with an entangled quantum spin ground state.</description>

      <title>Energy Windows Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)</title>

Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction, Energy Windows Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW), we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Kohn Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the linearization energy of the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed, to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the linearization energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW).</description>

      <title>Predicting Grain Boundary Segregation in Magnesium Alloys: An Atomistically Informed Machine Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) segregation in magnesium (Mg) substantially influences its mechanical properties and performance. Atomic-scale modelling, typically using ab-initio or semi-empirical approaches, has mainly focused on GB segregation at highly symmetric GBs in Mg alloys, often failing to capture the diversity of local atomic environments and segregation energies, resulting in inaccurate structure-property predictions. This study employs atomistic simulations and machine learning models to systematically investigate the segregation behavior of common solute elements in polycrystalline Mg at both 0 K and finite temperatures. The machine learning models accurately predict segregation thermodynamics by incorporating energetic and structural descriptors. We found that segregation energy and vibrational free energy follow skew-normal distributions, with hydrostatic stress, an indicator of excess free volume, emerging as an important factor influencing segregation tendency. The local atomic environment's flexibility, quantified by flexibility volume, is also crucial in predicting GB segregation. Comparing the grain boundary solute concentrations calculated via the Langmuir-McLean isotherm with experimental data, we identified a pronounced segregation tendency for Nd, highlighting its potential for GB engineering in Mg alloys. This work demonstrates the powerful synergy of atomistic simulations and machine learning, paving the way for designing advanced lightweight Mg alloys with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology elucidates hierarchical structures responsible for mechanical properties in covalent amorphous solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how atomic-level structures govern the mechanical properties of amorphous materials remains a fundamental challenge in solid-state physics. Under mechanical loading, amorphous materials exhibit simple affine and spatially inhomogeneous nonaffine displacements that contribute to the elastic modulus through the Born (affine) and nonaffine terms, respectively. The differences between soft local structures characterized by small Born terms or large nonaffine displacements have yet to be elucidated. This challenge is particularly complex in covalent amorphous materials such as silicon, where the medium-range order (MRO) plays a crucial role in the network structure. To address these issues, we combined molecular dynamics simulations with persistent homology analysis. Our results reveal that local structures with small Born terms are governed by short-range characteristics, whereas those with large nonaffine displacements exhibit hierarchical structures in which short-range disorder is embedded within the MRO. These hierarchical structures are also strongly correlated with low-energy localized vibrational excitations. Our findings demonstrate that the mechanical responses and dynamic properties of covalent amorphous materials are intrinsically linked to the MRO, providing a new framework for understanding and tailoring their properties.</description>

      <title>Cahn-Hilliard model with Schl\"ogl Reactions: interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. II. Memory effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work is a continuation of our previous paper [Condens. Matter Phys., 2020, 23, 33602: 1-17]. It is devoted to the modelling of the interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. The modelling of equilibrium phase transition is based on the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation. The non-equilibrium phase transition is modeled by the Second Schl\"ogl reaction system. We consider the advancing front, which combines these both transitions. Different from the first article, we consider here the memory effects, i.e., the effects of non-Fickian diffusion. The traveling wave solution is obtained, and its dependence on the model parameters is studied in detail. The relative importance of memory effects for different process regimes is estimated.</description>

      <title>Auto-resolving the atomic structure at van der Waals interfaces using a generative model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-resolution visualization of atomic structures is significant for understanding the relationship between the microscopic configurations and macroscopic properties of materials. However, a rapid, accurate, and robust approach to automatically resolve complex patterns in atomic-resolution microscopy remains difficult to implement. Here, we present a Trident strategy-enhanced disentangled representation learning method (a generative model), which utilizes a few unlabelled experimental images with abundant low-cost simulated images to generate a large corpus of annotated simulation data that closely resembles experimental results, producing a high-quality large-volume training dataset. A structural inference model is then trained via a residual neural network which can directly deduce the interlayer slip and rotation of diversified and complicated stacking patterns at van der Waals interfaces with picometer-scale accuracy across various materials (e.g. MoS2, WS2, ReS2, ReSe2, and 1T'-MoTe2) with different layer numbers , demonstrating robustness to defects, imaging quality, and surface contaminations. The framework can also identify pattern transition interfaces, quantify subtle motif variations, and discriminate moire patterns that are difficult to distinguish in frequency domains. Finally, the high-throughput processing ability of our method provides insights into a van der Waals epitaxy mode where various thermodynamically favorable slip stackings can coexist.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Investigation of PbSe Thermoelectric Material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermoelectric characteristics of lead selenium (PbSe) doped with gallium (Ga) are investigated in this study. When the lead sulfide (PbSe) is tuned with appropriate dopants, it exhibits satisfactory ZT values, hence making it a promising thermoelectric material. This study examines the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and power factor of PbSe, with varying amounts of added Ga. Results indicate that incorporating Ga into PbSe improves its thermoelectric performance, with a maximum ZT value of approximately 1.2 at 873 K for the optimal doping concentration of 0.005 atomic percent. This improvement is attributed to the combined effects of increased electrical conductivity and reduced thermal conductivity. These findings suggest that Ga-doped PbSe is a promising candidate for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verification and validation of methods and first-principles software are at the core of computational solid-state physics but are too rarely addressed. We compare four first-principles codes: Abinit, Quantum ESPRESSO, EPW, ZG, and three methods: (i) the Allen-Heine-Cardona theory using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), (ii) the Allen-Heine-Cardona theory using Wannier function perturbation theory (WFPT), and (iii) an adiabatic non-perturbative frozen-phonon method. For these cases, we compute the real and imaginary parts of the electron-phonon self-energy in diamond and BAs, including dipoles and quadrupoles when interpolating. We find excellent agreement between software that implements the same formalism as well as good agreement between the DFPT and WFPT methods. Importantly, we find that the Deybe-Waller term is momentum dependent which impacts the mass enhancement, yielding approximate results when using the Luttinger approximations. Finally, we compare the electron-phonon spectral functions between Abinit and EPW and find excellent agreement even away from the band edges.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a machine learning prediction workflow to study the impact of defects on the Raman response of 2D materials. By combining the use of machine-learned interatomic potentials, the Raman-active $\Gamma$-weighted density of states method and splitting configurations in independant patches, we are able to reach simulation sizes in the tens of thousands of atoms, with diagonalization now being the main bottleneck of the simulation. We apply the method to two systems, isotopic graphene and defective hexagonal boron nitride, and compare our predicted Raman response to experimental results, with good agreement. Our method opens up many possibilities for future studies of Raman response in solid-state physics.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayers with reduced wake-up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films, significant research has focused on Zr-doped HfO$_2$ and solid solution (Hf,Zr)O$_2$ thin films. Functional properties can be further tuned via multilayering, however, this approach has not yet been fully explored in HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ films. This work demonstrates ferroelectricity in a 50 nm thick, solution-processed HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayer film, marking it as the thickest multilayer film to date exhibiting ferroelectric properties. The multilayer structure was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, with high-resolution TEM revealing grain continuity across multiple layers. This finding indicates that a polar phase in the originally paraelectric ZrO$_2$ layer, can be stabilized by the HfO$_2$ layer. The film attains a remanent polarization of 9 uC/cm$^2$ and exhibits accelerated wake-up behavior, attributed to its higher breakdown strength resulting from the incorporation of multiple interfaces. These results offer a faster wake-up mechanism for thick ferroelectric hafnia films.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the site occupancy preferences of Al in Ta(Fe$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_2$ Laves phases using first-principles calculations, covering Al concentrations from 0 to 50 at.\%. Al atoms exhibit a strong preference for $2a$ Wyckoff sites, with configurations becoming more energetically favorable as these sites reach full occupancy at high Al concentrations. Magnetic configurations were explored, revealing that anti-ferromagnetic ordering is the most favorable at ground states. A metastable defect phase diagram based on the chemical potential of Al was constructed to map site occupancy preferences, where Ta$_4$Fe$_6$Al$_2$ and Ta$_4$Fe$_2$Al$_6$ exhibit the widest chemical potential windows. The correlation between lattice distortions and site occupancy was examined, demonstrating that symmetric Al distributions enhance structural preference. These findings offer insights into the structural motifs of the Ta-Fe-Al system, providing a foundation for future investigations on structure-property relationships.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\text{2D}$ of atomically clean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density in correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (&lt; 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering</description>

      <title>Precritical anomalous scaling and magnetization temperature dependence in cubic ferromagnetic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in spintronics have drawn renewed attention to the spin dynamics of cubic ferromagnetic crystals EuO and EuS. These ferromagnets have the simplest possible magnetic structure, making them the most suitable systems for testing various theoretical models of magnetic materials. A commonly used Weiss mean-field approximation (MFA) provides only a qualitative description of the magnetization temperature dependence $M(T)$. We develop a consistent theory for $M(T)$ based on the perturbation diagrammatic technique for spin operators. Our theory is in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental dependence of $M(T)$ for EuO and EuS throughout the entire temperature range from $T=0$ to Curie temperature $T_{C}$. In particular, our theoretical dependence $M(T)$ demonstrates a scaling behavior $M(T)\propto (T_{C}-T)^{\beta_*}$ with the scaling index $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ in a wide range of temperatures in agreement with the experimentally observed apparent scaling in EuO and EuS. The scaling behavior with $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ is manifested in the temperature range $T\lesssim T_{C}$ where corrections to the magnetization due to its fluctuations $\delta M (T)\lesssim M(T)$. To distinguish it from the narrow ``critical" range $T\approx T_{C}$ with $\delta M (T) &gt; M(T)$, we term this $T$-range ``precritical". The precritical corrections $\delta M (T)$ are still large enough to affect the $M(T)$ behavior. The index $\beta_*$ fundamentally differs from the ``normal" scaling index $\beta_{MFA}=1/2$ predicted by the MFA, which neglects the magnetization fluctuations. We refer to the emerging in our theory apparent magnetization scaling with $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ as ``precritical anomalous".</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Activation of Symmetry-Forbidden Exciton-Phonon Couplings for Enhanced Phonon-Assisted Photoluminescence in MoS$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonon-assisted photoluminescence (PL) in molybdenum-based two-dimensional dichalcogenides is typically weak due to the dormant phonon coupling with optically inactive momentum-dark (intervalley) excitons, unlike in tungsten-based dichalcogenides where such processes are more prominent. Despite this inefficiency, we revisit excitons in MoS$_2$ using rigorous finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations to identify ways to enhance phonon-assisted recombination channels. Our ab-initio results, complemented by group-theoretic analyses, reveal that while unstrained MoS$_2$ exhibits no phonon-assisted PL emissions at cryogenic temperatures due to forbidden A$^{\prime\prime}$ phonon modes, biaxial strain opens a pathway to significantly intensify this emission by activating hole-phonon A$^{\prime}$-mediated scattering channels. By calculating allowed exciton-phonon matrix elements and scattering rates, we demonstrate how strain redistributes oscillator strengths toward radiative recombination. These findings provide a promising route to improving PL emission efficiency in various metal dichalcogenide monolayers through strain engineering and offer valuable insights for further exploration of exciton-phonon dynamics, including time-resolved spectroscopic studies.</description>

      <title>Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamic approach based on the multiconfiguration Haqrtree method to description of exciton self-trapping is proposed. Primarily motivated by the phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high excitation concentrations we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. In particular, based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steady-state solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The bi-self-trapped exciton in the mirror-symmetric configuration can be described by the Dicke Hamiltonian and is responsible for superfluorescence. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.</description>

      <title>$\Delta$-model correction of Foundation Model based on the models own understanding</title>

Abstract: Foundation models of interatomic potentials, so called universal potentials, may require fine-tuning or residual corrections when applied to specific subclasses of materials. In the present work, we demonstrate how such augmentation can be accomplished via $\Delta$-learning based on the representation already embedded in the universal potentials. The $\Delta$-model introduced is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model and various types of aggregation (global, species-separated, and atomic) of the representation vector are discussed. Employing a specific universal potential, CHGNet [Deng et al., Nat. Mach. Intell. 5, 1031 (2023)], in a global structure optimization setting, we find that it correctly describes the energetics of the "8" Cu oxide, which is an ultra-thin oxide film on Cu(111). The universal potential model even predicts a more favorable structure compared to that discussed in recent DFT-based literature. Moving to sulfur adatom overlayers on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) the CHGNet model, however, requires corrections. We demonstrate that these are efficiently provided via the GPR-based $\Delta$-model formulated on the CHGNet's own internal atomic embedding representation. The need for corrections is tracked to the scarcity of metal-sulfur atomic environments in the materials project database that CHGNet is trained on leading to an overreliance on sulfur-sulfur atomic environments. Other universal potentials trained on the same data, MACE-MP0, SevenNet-0, and ORB-v2-only-MPtrj show similar behavior, but with varying degrees of error, demonstrating the general need for augmentation schemes for universal potential models.</description>

      <title>Trilinear coupling and toroidicity in multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric responses are related in general to magnetic multipoles, and in particular the off-diagonal linear response is proportional to the toroidization order parameter. In multiferroics with three order parameters (polarization, magnetization, and toroidization), such response turns out to be also proportional to the trilinear coupling between the order parameters. Here we explore this scenario, discussing the effects of such trilinear coupling within a Landau theory framework, and using ab initio calculations to discuss a specific model system for this effect, namely the recently predicted three-order-parameter multiferroic metal Bi$_5$Mn$_5$O$_{17}$.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of thermoelectric properties of $\textrm{CeIr}_\textrm{4} \textrm{P}_\textrm{12}$ filled skutterudite for energy conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural, elastic, thermodynamic and thermoelectric characteristics of the $\textrm{CeIr}_\textrm{4} \textrm{P}_\textrm{12}$ skutterudite have been predicted for the first time by applying density functional theory and the semi-classical Boltzmann simulations. Firstly, the structural-magnetic stability was verified through ground-state energy calculations obtained from structural optimizations. The predicted single-crystal elastic constants (${C}_{ij}$) show that the title compound is mechanically stable. At the same time, it turns out to be dynamically stable where all the calculated phonon frequencies have positive values. The cohesive energy was calculated to verify the energy stability of the material considered. We also determined the variations of some macroscopic physical parameters as functions of temperature, namely the thermal expansion coefficient, the lattice thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we investigated the temperature dependencies of some thermoelectric coefficients such as electronic thermal conductivity, and figure of merit. Such encouraging results indicate that the compound is a potential candidate for thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.</description>

      <title>Structural and transport properties of LiTFSI/G3 electrolyte with machine-learned molecular dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)azanide-triglyme electrolyte plays a critical role in the performance of lithium-ion batteries. However, its solvation structure and transport properties at the atomic scale remain incompletely understood. In this study, we develop an efficient and accurate neuroevolution potential (NEP) model by integrating bootstrap and active learning strategies. Using machine-learned NEP-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the structural and diffusion properties of LiTFSI/G3 across a wide range of the solute-to-solvent ratios, systematically analyzing electrolyte density, ion coordination, viscosity, and lithium self-diffusion. The computed densities show excellent agreement with experimental data, and pair correlation analysis reveals significant interactions between lithium ions and surrounding oxygen atoms, which strongly impacts Li$^+$ mobility. Viscosity and diffusion calculations further demonstrate that increasing LiTFSI concentration enhances Li-O interactions, resulting in higher viscosity and reduced lithium diffusion. Additionally, machine learning-based path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations confirm the negligible impact of quantum effects on Li$^+$ transport. The electrolyte-specific protocol developed in this work provides a systematic framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning potentials for complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical crystal chemistry views crystal structures as the optimal solutions of mathematical optimization problem formalizing inorganic structural chemistry. This paper introduces the minimum and maximum atomic radii depending on the types of geometrical constraints, extending the concept of effective atomic sizes. These radii define permissible interatomic distances instead of interatomic forces, constraining feasible types and connections of coordination polyhedra. The definition shows the aspect that crystal structures are packings of atomic spheres. Additionally, creatability functions for geometrical constraints, which give a choice of creatable types of geometrical constraints depending on the spatial order of atoms, are implemented to guide randomly generated structures toward optimal solutions. The framework identifies unique optimal solutions corresponding to the structures of spinel, pyrochlore ($\alpha$ and $\beta$), pyroxene, quadruple perovskite, cuprate superconductor $\mathrm{YBa}_2 \mathrm{Cu}_3 \mathrm{O}_{7-x}$, and iron-based superconductor $\mathrm{LaFeAsO}$. Notably, up to $95\%$ of oxide crystal structure types in Inorganic Crystal Structure Database align with the optimal solutions preserving experimental structures despite the discretized feasible atomic radii. These findings highlight the role of mathematical optimization problem as a theoretical foundation for mathematical crystal chemistry, enabling efficient structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Scaling in Kinetics of Supercooled Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase transition.We further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately constant.This constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</description>

      <title>Imaging moir\'e flat bands and Wigner molecular crystals in twisted bilayer MoTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconducting moir\'e materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Recently, tMoTe2 has attracted significant attentions due to the observation of the long-sought fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the tMoTe2 moir\'e superlattice remains elusive. Here, we report STM/STS studies in dual-gated tMoTe2 moir\'e devices with twist angles ranging from 2.3 to 3.8 deg. The device consists of two independent back-gates, one enables an ohmic contact for tMoTe2, while the other fine-tunes the Fermi level of tMoTe2. This dual-gate control enables direct measurement of the electronic structure in tMoTe2 under varied displacement fields and moir\'e filling factors, by fine tuning the gate voltage and the tip bias. Our STS spectra and spatial imaging reveal that the low-energy moir\'e flat bands are predominantly localized in the XM and MX regions of the moir\'e superlattice. At zero E-field, these bands form a honeycomb lattice with non-trivial topology, whereas an applied E-field drives a transition into two distinct triangular lattices with trivial topology. The spatial distributions align with large-scale first-principle calculations, demonstrating that the topological flat bands arise from the K-valley hybridization between the top and bottom MoTe2 layers. Furthermore, we show that the effective moir\'e potential depth can be controlled via gate and tip biases. At sufficient potential depths, we observe the emergence of Wigner molecular crystals, transitioning MX triangular lattice into a Kagome lattice at MX moir\'e filling factor 3. These results elucidate the microscopic origin of topological flat bands in tMoTe2 and demonstrate electric-field control of topology and correlated electronic orders, paving the way to engineer exotic quantum phases in moir\'e simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hallmark of topological crystalline insulators is the emergence of a robust electronic state in a bandgap localized at the boundary of the material. However, end, edge, and surface states can also have a nontopological origin. Unfortunately, topological invariants such as the winding number and Zak phase are often not directly experimentally accessible for solids. In addition to topological invariants, the position of the Wannier centers provides a fingerprint for the topological character of a material. Here, we demonstrate a method to experimentally determine the location of Wannier centers in artificial lattices made of Cs/InAs(111)A by integrating the density of states. We determine the locations of the Wannier centers for various 1D chains, topological and trivial, and corroborate our findings with tight-binding simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the redox switching of ferrocene moieties embedded in a double tunnel barrier plasmonic cavity fabricated from a click-chemistry self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenyl-alkylthiol on ultra flat gold surfaces, connected to a single poly(vinylpyrrolidone) capped silver nanocube, AgNC, which is contacted by the tip of a conductive-AFM to study the electron transport properties in the dark and under light irradiation at the plasmonic resonance wavelengths. We observe a dual behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in the dark: a large hysteresis loop at positive voltages and an hysteretic negative differential conductance (NDC) at negative voltages, due to the redox switching of ferrocene between its oxidized (Fc+) and neutral (Fc0) states. The I-V curves are analyzed by a generalized combined Marcus-Landauer model. We determine the highest occupied molecular orbital of the Fc+ and Fc0 states at 0.54 and 0.42 eV below the Fermi energy, respectively, with a weak reorganization energy &lt; 0.1 eV upon switching. Under plasmonic excitation, the hysteresis and NDC behaviors are no longer observed and the I-V characteristics of the Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol/AgNC junctions become similar to Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol SAMs. A virtual molecular orbital due to the plasmon-induced coupling (fast electron transfer) between the two redox states of the Fc is determined at 0.46 eV. This dynamic behavior opens perspectives in artificial synaptic devices for neuromorphic computing with the additional function to turn on/off this synaptic behavior on-demand by light.</description>

      <title>Explicit demonstration of the equivalence between DFT+U and the Hartree-Fock limit of DFT+DMFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several methods have been developed to improve the predictions of density functional theory (DFT) in the case of strongly correlated electron systems. Out of these approaches, DFT+$U$, which corresponds to a static treatment of the local interaction, and DFT combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), which considers local fluctuations, have both proven incredibly valuable in tackling the description of materials with strong local electron-electron interactions. While it is in principle known that the Hartree-Fock (HF) limit of the DFT+DMFT approach should recover DFT+$U$, demonstrating this equivalence in practice is challenging, due to the very different ways in which the two approaches are generally implemented. In this work, we introduce a way to perform DFT+$U$ calculations in Quantum ESPRESSO using Wannier functions as calculated by Wannier90, which allows us to use the same Hubbard projector functions both in DFT+$U$ and in DFT+DMFT. We benchmark these DFT+$U$ calculations against DFT+DMFT calculations where the DMFT impurity problem is solved within the HF approximation. Considering a number of prototypical materials including NiO, MnO, LaMnO$_3$, and LuNiO$_3$, we establish the sameness of the two approaches. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our approach by going beyond the commonly used atomic orbital-like projectors by performing DFT+$U$ calculations for VO$_2$ using a special set of bond-centered Wannier functions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin Hall effect is usually realized in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry, but whether it can be realized without symmetry protection remains unexplored. Here, we propose type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with quantized spin Hall conductivity, whose edge states with opposite chirality and polarization, distributed in different Brillouin zone regions, connect the conduction and valence bands at the boundary. Thus, the type-II quantum spin Hall insulator does not require any symmetry protection other than translational symmetry. Then, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that type-II quantum spin Hall insulator can be realized in both altermagnetic materials and Luttinger compensated magnetic materials. Furthermore, based on lattice model, we find that as long as $U(1)$ symmetry exists, type-II quantum spin Hall insulator phase can always exist stably. However, if $U(1)$ symmetry is broken, type-II quantum spin Hall insulator phase transforms into an obstructed atomic insulator phase as spin-orbit coupling effect is enhanced. Therefore, our work not only proposes a new mechanism for realizing the quantum spin Hall effect, but also enriches the types of unconventional magnetic topological phases.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Enhanced Unconventional Spin Current Anisotropy in a Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) presents a promising avenue for energy-efficient spintronics devices, surpassing the limitations of spin transfer torque. While extensively studied in heavy metals, SOT in antiferromagnetic quantum materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SOT in epitaxial FeSn, a collinear antiferromagnet with a kagome lattice. FeSn exhibits intriguing topological quantum features, including two-dimensional flat bands and Dirac-like surface states, making it an ideal platform for investigating emergent SOT properties. Using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we uncover a six-fold symmetric damping-like SOT in epitaxial-FeSn/Py heterostructures, reflecting the six-fold symmetry of the epitaxial [0001]-oriented FeSn films. Additionally, we observe a substantial unconventional field-like torque, originating from spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization. This torque exhibits a unique angular dependence-a superposition of six-fold crystalline symmetry and uniaxial symmetry associated with the antiferromagnetic spin Hall effect. Notably, the unconventional field-like torque is enhanced when the RF current flows along the Neel vector in FeSn. Our findings reveal an unconventional spin current anisotropy tunable by crystalline and magnetic symmetry, offering a novel approach for controlling SOT in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nLanE) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nLanE-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nLanE-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through SIE4x4 and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.</description>
