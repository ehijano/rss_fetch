      <title>Optimal Decision Mechanisms for Committees: Acquitting the Guilty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group of privately informed agents chooses between two alternatives. How should the decision rule be designed if agents are known to be biased in favor of one of the options? We address this question by considering the Condorcet Jury Setting as a mechanism design problem. Applications include the optimal decision mechanisms for boards of directors, political committees, and trial juries.
  While we allow for any kind of mechanism, the optimal mechanism is a voting mechanism. In the terminology of the trial jury example: When jurors (agents) are more eager to convict than the lawmaker (principal), then the defendant should be convicted if and only if neither too many nor too few jurors vote to convict.
  This kind of mechanism accords with a judicial procedure from ancient Jewish law.</description>

      <title>Carbon Pricing and Resale in Emission Trading Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary markets and resale are integral components of all emission trading systems. Despite the justification for these secondary trades, such as unpredictable demand, they may encourage speculation and result in the misallocation of permits. In this paper, our aim is to underscore the importance of efficiency in the initial allocation mechanism and to explore how concerns leading to the establishment of secondary markets, such as uncertain demand, can be addressed through alternative means, such as frequent auctions. We demonstrate that the existence of a secondary market could lead to higher untruthful bids in the auction, further encouraging speculation and the accumulation of rent. Our results suggest that an inefficient initial allocation could enable speculators with no use value for the permits to bid in the auction and subsequently earn rents in secondary markets by trading these permits. Even if the secondary market operates efficiently, the resulting rent, which represents a potential loss of auction revenue, cannot be overlooked.</description>

      <title>Blackwell-Monotone Information Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Blackwell-monotone information cost function assigns higher costs to Blackwell more informative experiments. This paper provides simple necessary and sufficient conditions for a cost function to be Blackwell monotone over finite experiments. The key condition involves a system of linear differential inequalities. By using this characterization, we show that when a cost function is additively separable, it is Blackwell monotone if and only if it is the sum of sublinear functions. This identifies a wide range of practical information cost functions. Finally, we apply our results to bargaining and persuasion problems with costly information, broadening and strengthening earlier findings.</description>

      <title>A Decentralized Market Mechanism for Energy Communities under Operating Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an operating envelopes (OEs) aware energy community market mechanism that dynamically charges/rewards its members based on two-part pricing. The OEs are imposed exogenously by a regulated distribution system operator (DSO) on the energy community's revenue meter and is subject to a generalized net energy metering (NEM) tariff design. By formulating the interaction of the community operator and its members as a Stackelberg game, we show that the proposed two-part pricing achieves a Nash equilibrium and maximizes the community's social welfare in a decentralized fashion while ensuring that the community's operation abides by the OEs. The market mechanism conforms with the cost-causation principle and guarantees community members a surplus level no less than their maximum surplus when they autonomously face the DSO. The dynamic and uniform community price is a monotonically decreasing function of the community's aggregate renewable generation. We also analyze the impact of exogenous parameters such as NEM rates and OEs on the value of joining the community. Lastly, through numerical studies, we showcase the community's welfare, and pricing, and compare its members' surplus to customers under the DSO's regime.</description>
