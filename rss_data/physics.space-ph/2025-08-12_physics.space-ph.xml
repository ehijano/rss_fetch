      <title>Extreme Solar Storm Reveals Causal Interactions in Space Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar storms perturb Earth's magnetosphere, triggering geomagnetic storms that threaten space-based systems and infrastructure. Despite advances in spaceborne and ground-based observations, the causal chain driving solar-magnetosphere-ionosphere dynamics remains elusive due to multiphysics coupling, nonlinearity, and cross-scale complexity. This study presents an information-theoretic framework to decipher interaction mechanisms in extreme solar geomagnetic storms across intensity levels within space weather causal chains, using 1980-2024 datasets. Unexpectedly, we uncover auroral spatial causality patterns associated with space weather threats in the Arctic during May 2024 extreme storms. By integrating causal consistency constraints into spatiotemporal modeling, SolarAurora outperforms existing frameworks, achieving superior accuracy in forecasting May/October 2024 events. These results advance understanding of space weather dynamics and establish a promising framework for scientific discovery and forecasting extreme space weather events.</description>

      <title>Large Model Driven Solar Activity AI Forecaster: A Scalable Dual Data-Model Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar activity drives space weather, affecting Earth's magnetosphere and technological infrastructure, which makes accurate solar flare forecasting critical. Current space weather models under-utilize multi-modal solar data, lack iterative enhancement via expert knowledge, and rely heavily on human forecasters under the Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action (OODA) paradigm. Here we present the "Solar Activity AI Forecaster", a scalable dual data-model driven framework built on foundational models, integrating expert knowledge to autonomously replicate human forecasting tasks with quantifiable outputs. It is implemented in the OODA paradigm and comprises three modules: a Situational Perception Module that generates daily solar situation awareness maps by integrating multi-modal observations; In-Depth Analysis Tools that characterize key solar features (active regions, coronal holes, filaments); and a Flare Prediction Module that forecasts strong flares for the full solar disk and active regions. Executed within a few minutes, the model outperforms or matches human forecasters in generalization across multi-source data, forecast accuracy, and operational efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm for AI-based space weather forecasting, demonstrating AI's potential to enhance forecast accuracy and efficiency, and paving the way for autonomous operational forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>Advances in aviation radiation mitigation were demonstrated during the Gannon storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A validation strategy for aviation radiation hazard mitigation has been completed using two commercial airline flights in 2024 and 2025. We review the strategy primary elements, including the emergence of aviation radiation awareness and collaborative efforts by global aviation and radiological bodies that established mitigation standards. The article highlights biological effects of radiation exposure influenced by altitude, latitude, and geomagnetic conditions, upon aircrew, frequent flyers, and commercial space travelers. It recognizes the SWAG user needs survey report that identifies the need for continuous monitoring and predictive models to ensure long-term occupational and public health safety. The ALARA strategy validation was completed using two UAL 990 flights on B777 200 aircraft between San Francisco and Paris. Each carried the same ARMAS FM7 radiation monitoring unit. One flight occurred during the Gannon storm May 10 and 11, 2024 and one flight occurred during quiet geomagnetic conditions June 8 and 9, 2025. The flight results validated the strategy during extreme space weather, i.e., apply operational controls for shielding to reduce dose. One approach is fly lower magnetic latitudes to gain more Earth magnetic field shielding and the other is fly lower altitudes to use atmosphere depth shielding. Both ALARA shielding methods are controllable in airline operations and air traffic management. This study shows the effectiveness to deviate flight paths to lower magnetic latitude routes and lower altitudes during major geomagnetic storms. Not only does this approach mitigate HF communication outages but it also reduces risks from increased GNSS errors for takeoff and landing navigation. Magnetic field shielding is a major risk reduction factor for radiation, communication, and navigation while altitude shielding reduces radiation hazard risks.</description>
