      <title>Reevaluating the Origin of Detectable Cataclysmic Variables in Globular Clusters: Testing the Importance of Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the current detectable cataclysmic variable (CV) population in Galactic globular clusters (GCs), we show that there is not a clear relation between the number of sources per unit of mass and the stellar encounter rate, the cluster mass, or the cluster central density. If any, only in the case of core-collapsed GCs could there be an anticorrelation with the stellar encounter rate. Our findings contrast with previous studies where clear positive correlations were identified. Our results suggest that correlations between faint X-ray sources, from which often conclusions for the CV population are drawn, and the GC parameters considered here, are likely influenced by other type of X-ray sources, including other types of compact binaries, which have X-ray luminosities similar to CVs. The findings presented here also suggest that the role of primordial systems is more important than previously believed and that dynamical formation has less influence in the current detectable CV population. The long-standing paradigm that GCs are efficient factories of CVs formed via dynamical interactions does not seem to be supported by current observations.</description>

      <title>The Critical Mass Ratio for W UMa-type Contact Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contact binaries are close binary systems in which both components fill their inner Roche lobes so that the stars are in direct contact and in potential mass and energy exchange. The most common such systems of low-mass are the so-called W UMa-type. In the last few years, there is a growing interest of the astronomical community in stellar mergers, primarily due to the detection of gravitational waves (mergers of black holes and neutron stars), but also because of an alternative model for type Ia supernovae (merger of two white dwarfs), which are again particularly important in cosmology where they played an important role in the discovery of dark energy and the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In that sense, contact systems of W UMa-type with extremely low mass ratio are especially interesting because there are indications that in their case, too, stars can merge and possible form fast-rotating stars such as FC Com stars and the blue-stragglers, and (luminous) red novae such as V1309 Sco. Namely, previous theoretical research has shown that in the cases when the orbital angular momentum of the system is only about three times larger than the rotational angular momentum of the primary, a tidal Darwin's instability occurs, the components can no longer remain in synchronous rotation, orbit continue to shrink fast and they finally merge into a single star. The above stability condition for contact systems can be linked to some critical mass ratio below which we expect a system to be unstable. We give an overview of this condition and show how it can be used to identify potential mergers. Finally, we discuss a number of known extreme mass ratio binaries from the literature and prospect for future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>Derivative Spectroscopy and its Application at Detecting the Weak Emission/Absorption Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic survey telescopes like Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and Sloan Digital Sky Survey has opened up unprecedented opportunities for stellar classification. Specific types of stars, such as early-type emission-line stars and those with stellar winds, can be distinguished by the profiles of their spectral lines. In this paper, we introduce a method based on derivative spectroscopy (DS) designed to detect signals within complex backgrounds and provide a preliminary estimation of curve profiles. This method exhibits a unique advantage in identifying weak signals and unusual spectral line profiles when compared to other popular line detection methods. We validated our approach using synthesis spectra, demonstrating that DS can detect emission signals three times fainter than Gaussian fitting. Furthermore, we applied our method to 579,680 co-added spectra from LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey, identifying 16,629 spectra with emission peaks around the H{\alpha} line from 10,963 stars. These spectra were classified into three distinct morphological groups, resulting in nine subclasses as follows. (1) Emission peak above the pseudo-continuum line (single peak, double peaks, emission peak situated within an absorption line, P Cygni profile, Inverse P Cygni profile); (2) Emission peak below the pseudo-continuum line (sharp emission peak, double absorption peaks, emission peak shifted to one side of the absorption line); (3) Emission peak between the pseudo-continuum line.</description>

      <title>EC 19529-4430: SALT identifies the most carbon- and metal-poor extreme helium star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EC 19529-4430 was identified as a helium-rich star in the Edinburgh-Cape Survey of faint-blue objects and subsequently resolved as a metal-poor extreme helium (EHe) star in the SALT survey of chemically-peculiar hot subdwarfs. This paper presents a fine analysis of the SALT high-resolution spectrum. EC 19529-4430 has $T_{\rm eff} = 20\,700 \pm250$\,K, $\log g /{\rm cm\,s^{-2}} = 3.49\pm0.03$, and an overall metallicity some 1.3 dex below solar; surface hydrogen is $\approx 0.5\%$ by number. The surface CNO ratio 1:100:8 implies that the surface consists principally of CNO-processed helium and makes EC 19529-4430 the coolest known carbon-poor and nitrogen-rich EHe star. Metal-rich analogues include V652 Her and GALEX J184559.8-413827. Kinematically, its retrograde orbit indicates membership of the galactic halo. No pulsations were detected in TESS photometry and there is no evidence for a binary companion. EC 19529-4430 most likely formed from the merging of two helium white dwarfs, which themselves formed as a binary system some 11 Gyr ago.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the effective temperature scale of red giant branch stellar models: the case of the metal-poor halo giant HD 122563</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is plenty of evidence in the literature of significant discrepancies between the observations and models of metal-poor red giant branch stars, in particular regarding the effective temperature, teff, scale. We revisit the benchmark star HD 122563 using the most recent observations from Gaia Data Release 3, to investigate if these new constraints may help in resolving this discrepancy. We review the most recent spectroscopic determinations of the metallicity of HD 122563 [Fe/H], and provide a new assessment of its fundamental parameters, i.e. bolometric luminosity, teff, surface gravity, plus a photometric determination of its metal content. Using these constraints, we compare the position of the star in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram with various recent sets of stellar evolution tracks. The H-R diagram analysis reveals a significant disagreement between observed and theoretical teff values, when adopting the most recent spectroscopic estimate of [Fe/H]. On the other hand, by using the photometric determination of [Fe/H] some of the selected sets of stellar tracks appear in fair agreement with observations. The sets with discrepant teff can be made to agree with observations either by modifying the prescription adopted to calculate the models' outer boundary conditions, and/or by reducing the adopted value of the mixing length parameter with respect to the solar-calibration. A definitive assessment of whether the teff scale of metal-poor stellar red giant branch models is consistent with observations requires an even more accurate determination of the fundamental parameters of HD 122563 and also a larger sample of calibrators. From the theoretical side, it is crucial to minimise the current uncertainties in the treatment (boundary conditions, temperature gradient) of the outer layers of stellar models with convective envelopes.</description>

      <title>Constraining stellar tidal quality factors from planet-induced stellar spin-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of tight star-planet systems is influenced by tidal interactions between the star and the planet, as was shown recently. The rate at which spins and orbits in such a system evolve depends on the stellar and planetary tidal dissipation efficiency. Here, we present a method to constrain the modified tidal quality factor $Q'_*$ of a planet-hosting star whose rotational evolution has been altered by its planet through angular momentum transfer from the planetary orbital motion to the rotation of the stellar convective zone. The altered rotation is estimated from an observed discrepancy of magnetic activity of the planet-hosting star and a coeval companion star, i.e. this method is applicable to star-planet systems with wide stellar companions. We give an example of the planet-hosting wide binary system HD189733 and find that the planet host's modified tidal quality factor is constrained to be $Q'_* \leq 2.33 \times 10^7$.</description>

      <title>On the transition stage of pulsar pulsed radio emission and its potential association with radio pulsar nulling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the precise mechanism of generating pulsed coherent radio emission from pulsars remains elusive, certain gap-invoking models (especially, the inner gap model) offer a comprehensive and plausible explanation for the genesis and termination of such emissions. However, the transition stage between the period of persistent radio emission and the period of radio quiet remains poorly understood, despite observations indicating that a radio pulsar in the pulse nulling state is undergoing the transition stage. In this study, we present a qualitative explanation for the elusive transition stage by modeling pulsar magnetospheres analytically as equivalent RC circuits based on the inner gap model. Our result indicates that, due to lengthy spin-down, older radio pulsars will gradually shift from the state of persistent radio emission to a certain type of pulse nulling state by delayed sparks within their inner gaps.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Accretion-Driven Starquakes in Recycled Millisecond Pulsars using Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recycled millisecond pulsars are susceptible to starquakes as they are continuously accreting matter from their binary companion. A starquake happens when the rotational frequency of the star crosses its breaking frequency. In this study, we perform a model analysis of an accreting neutron star suffering a starquake. We analyze two models: a spherical star with accreting mountains and a deformed star with accreting mountains. We find that as the star crosses the breaking frequency and suffers a starquake there is a sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal arriving from them. It is interesting to note that the amplitude of the gravitational wave signals increases suddenly for the spherical star. In contrast, for the deformed star, the amplitude of the continuous gravitational wave signal decreases suddenly. This sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal in recycled millisecond pulsars can be a unique signature for such pulsars undergoing a starquake.</description>

      <title>Nuclear uncertainties associated with the ejecta of a neutron-star black-hole accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of heavy element nucleosynthesis requires input from yet-to-be-measured nuclear properties. The uncertainty in the values of these off-stability nuclear properties propagates to uncertainties in the predictions of elemental and isotopic abundances. However, for any given astrophysical explosion, there are many different trajectories, i.e. temperature and density histories, experienced by outflowing material and thus different nuclear properties can come into play. We consider combined nucleosynthesis results from 460,000 trajectories from a neutron star-black hole accretion disk and the find spread in elemental predictions due solely to unknown nuclear properties to be a factor of a few. We analyze this relative spread in model predictions due to nuclear variations and conclude that the uncertainties can be attributed to a combination of properties in a given region of the abundance pattern. We calculate a cross-correlation between mass changes and abundance changes to show how variations among the properties of participating nuclei may be explored. Our results provide further impetus for measurements of multiple quantities on individual short-lived neutron-rich isotopes at modern experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>The black hole low mass X-ray binary V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple, and formed without a kick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence suggests that when compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars form, they may receive a ``natal kick,'' where the stellar remnant gains momentum. Observational evidence for neutron star kicks is substantial, yet limited for black hole natal kicks, and some proposed black hole formation scenarios result in very small kicks. Here, we report the discovery that the canonical black hole low-mass X-ray binary V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple with a tertiary companion at least 3500 astronomical units away from the inner binary. Given the orbital configuration, the black hole likely received a sub-5 kilometer per second kick to have avoided unbinding the tertiary. This discovery reveals that at least some black holes form with nearly no natal kick. Furthermore, the tertiary in this system lends credence to evolutionary models of low-mass X-ray binaries involving a hierarchical triple structure. Remarkably, the tertiary is evolved, indicating that the system formed 3-5 billion years ago, and that the black hole has removed at least half a solar mass of matter from its evolved secondary companion. During the event in which the black hole formed, it is likely that at least half of the mass of the black hole progenitor collapsed into the black hole; it may even have undergone a complete implosion, enabling the tertiary to remain loosely bound.</description>

      <title>oMEGACat II -- Photometry and proper motions for 1.4 million stars in Omega Centauri and its rotation in the plane of the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way. It is thought to be the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy because of its high mass and its complex stellar populations. To decipher its formation history and study its dynamics, we created the most comprehensive kinematic catalog for its inner region, by analyzing both archival and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our catalog contains 1 395 781 proper-motion measurements out to the half-light radius of the cluster ($\sim$5.0') and down to $m_{F625W}\approx$25. The typical baseline for our proper-motion measurements is 20 years, leading to a median 1D proper motion precision of $\sim$11 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ for stars with $m_{F625W}\approx$18 mag, with even better precision ($\sim$6.6 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$) achieved in the extensively observed centermost (r$&lt;$1.5') region. In addition to our astrometric measurements, we also obtained precise HST photometry in seven filters spanning from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. This allows detailed color-magnitude-diagram studies and to separate the multiple stellar populations of the cluster. In this work, we describe the data reduction used to obtain both the photometric and the proper-motion measurements. We also illustrate the creation and the content of our catalog, which is made publicly available. Finally, we present measurements of the plane-of-sky rotation of $\omega$ Cen in the previously unprobed inner few arcminutes and a precise measurement of the inclination $i = (43.6\pm1.5)^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field oscillation model of pulsar radio emission: prediction of an observable effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of pulsars, the rotating-lighthouse model has been the choice of model to explain the radiation pulsation of pulsars. After discovering that some main sequence stars (e.g., CU Virginis) and ultracool dwarfs (e.g., TVLM 513-46546) also behave like pulsars, the lighthouse model was again adopted to explain their pulse signals. Our research found that if we use the magnetic-field oscillation (MO) model, we can explain the pulse radiation results better regardless of whether its source is a neutron star, a main-sequence star or an ultracool dwarf. We propose a verifiable prediction that can be used to evaluate the MO model. Our prediction is that there is a 90 degree phase lag between the magnetic field and radio signal of TVLM 513-46546, and the zero-crossing point of the magnetic field is the moment when the direction of the light's circular polarization is reversed. No new observations are needed to check this prediction, but certain existing data needs to be re-mined.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Origin of Ultra-long Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it discovered two ultra-long period radio transients GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (J1627) and GPM J1839$-$10 (J1839) with spin periods longer than 1000 s. The origin of these two ultra-long period radio transients is intriguing in understanding the spin evolution of neutron stars (NSs). In this work, we diagnose whether the interaction between strong magnetized NSs and fallback disks can spin NSs down to the observed ultra-long period. Our simulations found that the magnetar+fallback disk model can account for the observed period, period derivative, and X-ray luminosity of J1627 in the quasi-spin-equilibrium stage. To evolve to the current state of J1627, the initial mass-accretion rate of the fallback disk and the magnetic field of the NS are in the range of $(1.1-30)\times10^{24}~\rm g\,s^{-1}$ and $(2-5)\times10^{14}~\rm G$, respectively. In an active lifetime of fallback disk, J1839 is impossible to achieve the observed upper limit of period derivative. Therefore, we propose that J1839 may be in the second ejector phase after the fallback disk becomes inactive. Those NSs with a magnetic field of $(2-6)\times10^{14}~\rm G$ and a fallback disk with an initial mass-accretion rate of $\sim10^{24}-10^{26}~\rm g\,s^{-1}$ are the possible progenitors of J1839.</description>

      <title>Frequencies of warm debris disks based on point source catalogs of Spitzer, WISE, and Gaia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than a thousand warm debris disks have been detected as infrared excess at mid-infrared wavelengths, and their frequencies have been obtained for various spectral types of stars. However, the dependence of the frequencies on spectral type is still debated because the number of stars with significant and detectable infrared excess is limited. Herein, we present the largest systematic search for infrared excess using data from Gaia, WISE, and Spitzer. We identified 373, 485, and 255-reliable infrared excesses in the mid-infrared archival data at wavelengths of 12, 22, and 24 $\mu$m for WISE/$W3$, $W4$, and Spitzer/MIPS ch1, respectively. Although we confirmed that more massive stars tend to show higher frequencies of debris disks, these disk frequencies are relatively flat for both low- and intermediate-mass stars, with a jump at 7000 K for all three wavelengths. Assuming that bright, warm debris disks have lifetimes of a few to several hundred million years, the disk frequency can be understood as the ratio between the timescale and the upper limits of the sample ages. We also found that intermediate-mass stars with infrared excess tend to be bluer and fainter along the evolutionary track than those without, implying that massive stars hosting debris disks are relatively young, with an isochronal age of approximately 500 Myr. These tendencies are reasonably explained by a standard scenario in which debris disks are likely to be produced by collisions of planetesimals in early stages of stellar evolution, such as the Late Heavy Bombardment.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Analysis of Three-Dimensional Anisotropy in Imbalanced Alfv\'enic Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze in-situ observations of imbalanced solar wind turbulence to evaluate MHD turbulence models grounded in "Critical Balance" (CB) and "Scale-Dependent Dynamic Alignment" (SDDA). At energy injection scales, both outgoing and ingoing modes exhibit a weak cascade; a simultaneous tightening of SDDA is noted. Outgoing modes persist in a weak cascade across the inertial range, while ingoing modes shift to a strong cascade at $\lambda \approx 3 \times 10^{4} d_i$, with associated spectral scalings deviating from expected behavior due to "anomalous coherence" effects. The inertial range comprises two distinct sub-inertial segments. Beyond $\lambda \gtrsim 100 d_i$, eddies adopt a field-aligned tube topology, with SDDA signatures mainly evident in high amplitude fluctuations. The scaling exponents $\zeta_{n}$ of the $n$-th order conditional structure functions, orthogonal to both the local mean field and fluctuation direction, align with the analytical models of Chandran et al. 2015 and Mallet et al. 2017, indicating "multifractal" statistics and strong intermittency; however, scaling in parallel and displacement components is more concave than predicted, possibly influenced by expansion effects. Below $\lambda \approx 100 d_i$, eddies become increasingly anisotropic, evolving into thin current sheet-like structures. Concurrently, $\zeta_{n}$ scales linearly with order, marking a shift towards "monofractal" statistics. At $\lambda \approx 8 d_i$, the increase in aspect ratio halts, and the eddies become quasi-isotropic. This change may signal tearing instability, leading to reconnection, or result from energy redirection into the ion-cyclotron wave spectrum, aligning with the "helicity barrier". Our analysis utilizes 5-point structure functions, proving more effective than the traditional 2-point method in capturing steep scaling behaviors at smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Flickering pulsations in bright X-ray pulsars: the evidence of gravitationally lensed and eclipsed accretion column</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is expected that extreme mass accretion rate onto strongly magnetised neutron star results in appearance of accretion columns above stellar surface. For a distant observer, rotation of a star results in periodic variations of X-ray flux. Because the mass accretion rate fluctuates around the average value, the pulse profiles are not stable and demonstrate fluctuations as well. In the case of bright X-ray pulsars, however, pulse fluctuations are not solely attributed to variations in the mass accretion rate. They are also influenced by the variable height of the columns, which is dependent on the mass accretion rate. This study delves into the process of pulse profile formation in bright X-ray pulsars, taking into account stochastic fluctuations in the mass accretion rate, the corresponding variations in accretion column geometry and gravitational bending. Our analysis reveals that potential eclipses of accretion columns by a neutron star during their spin period should manifest specific features in pulse profile variability. Applying a novel pulse profile analysis technique, we successfully detect these features in the bright X-ray transient V0332+53 at luminosities $\gtrsim 2\times 10^{38}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. This detection serves as compelling evidence for the eclipse of an accretion column by a neutron star. Detection of the eclipse places constraints on the relation between neutron star mass, radius and accretion column height. Specifically, we can establish an upper limit on the accretion column height, which is crucial for refining theoretical models of extreme accretion.</description>

      <title>On the plasma quasi-thermal noise in the outer heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent paper by Li et al. on electron quasi-thermal noise in the outer heliosphere is flawed. It assumes the plasma drift speed to be much smaller than the electron thermal speed, even though both quantities are of the same order of magnitude in the outer heliosphere inward of the termination shock, because of the low plasma temperature. In this case, the Langmuir wave dispersion equation and the quasi-thermal noise in the antenna frame are completely changed. Furthermore, these calculations neglect the shot noise, which should produce a large contribution below the plasma frequency with the Voyager antennas in the outer heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Wormholes inside stars and black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct models of two exotic objects: (i) a wormhole whose throat is hidden by a stellar object like a neutron star; and (ii) a wormhole inside a black hole. We work within Einstein's gravity coupled to two scalar fields with a specific choice of the scalar field Lagrangian. In general, the model contains ghosts, but they are eliminated using the constraints given by the Lagrange multiplier fields. The constraints are a generalization of the mimetic constraint, where non-dynamical dark matter effectively appears. As a result, in our model, instead of the non-dynamical dark matter, non-dynamical exotic matter like a phantom effectively arises. For the mixed wormhole-plus-star system, we find the corresponding mass-radius relations and show that it is possible to get characteristics comparable to those of ordinary neutron stars. For the wormhole inside the black hole, we find an extremal limit where the radius of the throat coincides with the radius of the event horizon and demonstrate that the Hawking temperature vanishes in this limit.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-QUARKS Survey: II. the ACA 1.3 mm continuum source catalog and the assembly of dense gas in massive star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the high resolution, high sensitivity, and wide frequency coverage of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the QUARKS survey, standing for "Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures", is observing 139 massive star-forming clumps at ALMA Band 6 ($\lambda\sim$ 1.3 mm). This paper introduces the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7-m data. Combining multi-wavelength data, we provide the first edition of QUARKS atlas, offering insights into the multiscale and multiphase interstellar medium in high-mass star formation. The ACA 1.3 mm catalog includes 207 continuum sources that are called ACA sources. Their gas kinetic temperatures are estimated using three formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) transitions with a non-LTE radiation transfer model, and the mass and density are derived from a dust emission model. The ACA sources are massive (16-84 percentile values of 6-160 $M_{\odot}$), gravity-dominated ($M\propto R^{1.1}$) fragments within massive clumps, with supersonic turbulence ($\mathcal{M}&gt;1$) and embedded star-forming protoclusters. We find a linear correlation between the masses of the fragments and the massive clumps, with a ratio of 6% between the two. When considering the fragments as representative of dense gas, the ratio indicates a dense gas fraction (DGF) of 6%, although with a wide scatter ranging from 1% to 10%. If we consider the QUARKS massive clumps to be what is observed at various scales, then the size-independent DGF indicates a self-similar fragmentation or collapsing mode in protocluster formation. With the ACA data over four orders of magnitude of luminosity-to-mass ratio ($L/M$), we find that the DGF increases significantly with $L/M$, which indicates clump evolutionary stage. We observed a limited fragmentation at the subclump scale, which can be explained by dynamic global collapse process.</description>
