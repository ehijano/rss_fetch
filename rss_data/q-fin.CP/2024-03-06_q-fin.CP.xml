      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo for Efficient Fourier Pricing of Multi-Asset Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently pricing multi-asset options poses a significant challenge in quantitative finance. The Monte Carlo (MC) method remains the prevalent choice for pricing engines; however, its slow convergence rate impedes its practical application. Fourier methods leverage the knowledge of the characteristic function to accurately and rapidly value options with up to two assets. Nevertheless, they face hurdles in the high-dimensional settings due to the tensor product (TP) structure of commonly employed quadrature techniques. This work advocates using the randomized quasi-MC (RQMC) quadrature to improve the scalability of Fourier methods with high dimensions. The RQMC technique benefits from the smoothness of the integrand and alleviates the curse of dimensionality while providing practical error estimates. Nonetheless, the applicability of RQMC on the unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^d$, requires a domain transformation to $[0,1]^d$, which may result in singularities of the transformed integrand at the corners of the hypercube, and deteriorate the rate of convergence of RQMC. To circumvent this difficulty, we design an efficient domain transformation procedure based on the derived boundary growth conditions of the integrand. This transformation preserves the sufficient regularity of the integrand and hence improves the rate of convergence of RQMC. To validate this analysis, we demonstrate the efficiency of employing RQMC with an appropriate transformation to evaluate options in the Fourier space for various pricing models, payoffs, and dimensions. Finally, we highlight the computational advantage of applying RQMC over MC or TP in the Fourier domain, and over MC in the physical domain for options with up to 15 assets.</description>

      <title>Fill Probabilities in a Limit Order Book with State-Dependent Stochastic Order Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on computing the fill probabilities for limit orders positioned at various price levels within the limit order book, which play a crucial role in optimizing executions. We adopt a generic stochastic model to capture the dynamics of the order book as a series of queueing systems. This generic model is state-dependent and also incorporates stylized factors. We subsequently derive semi-analytical expressions to compute the relevant probabilities within the context of state-dependent stochastic order flows. These probabilities cover various scenarios, including the probability of a change in the mid-price, the fill probabilities of orders posted at the best quotes, and those posted at a price level deeper than the best quotes in the book, before the opposite best quote moves. These expressions can be further generalized to accommodate orders posted even deeper in the order book, although the associated probabilities are typically very small in such cases. Lastly, we conduct extensive numerical experiments using real order book data from the foreign exchange spot market. Our findings suggest that the model is tractable and possesses the capability to effectively capture the dynamics of the limit order book. Moreover, the derived formulas and numerical methods demonstrate reasonably good accuracy in estimating the fill probabilities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Entry and Exit with Signature in Statistical Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16008v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore an optimal timing strategy for the trading of price spreads exhibiting mean-reverting characteristics. A sequential optimal stopping framework is formulated to analyze the optimal timings for both entering and subsequently liquidating positions, all while considering the impact of transaction costs. Then we leverages a refined signature optimal stopping method to resolve this sequential optimal stopping problem, thereby unveiling the precise entry and exit timings that maximize gains. Our framework operates without any predefined assumptions regarding the dynamics of the underlying mean-reverting spreads, offering adaptability to diverse scenarios. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate its superior performance when comparing with conventional mean reversion trading rules.</description>
