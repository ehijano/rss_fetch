      <title>NSI-IBP: A General Numerical Singular Integral Method via Integration by Parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general framework of Numerical Singular Integrals (NSI) method based on the Integration By Parts (IBP) has been developed for integrals involving singular and nearly singular integrands, or NSI-IBP. Through a general integration by parts formula and by choosing some analytically integrable function to approximate the original integrand, various well-known integration by parts methods can be derived. Rigorous mathematical derivations have been performed to transform the original singular or nearly singular integrals into non-singular integrals that can be computed efficiently, along with the boundary values added. What's more important, the NSI-IBP method works well even when the exact form of the singular integrand is not known. Criteria on how to choose the appropriate function with a known analytical integral that closely approximates the original integrand have been outlined and explained. Numerical recipe has been presented to apply the proposed NSI-IBP. Numerical experiments have been carried out on various singular integrals such as the power-law decaying integrand, the logarithmic function, and their hybrid products. It can be shown that various relative accuracy up to $10^{-15}$ can be achieved, even the exact singular function is not known. Finally, the nearly singular integrals involving the scalar Green's function have been evaluated for both electrostatics applications and Computational Electromagnetics (CEM) applications.</description>

      <title>An enhanced single Gaussian point continuum finite element formulation using automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution presents an improved low-order 3D finite element formulation with hourglass stabilization using automatic differentiation (AD). Here, the former Q1STc formulation is enhanced by an approximation-free computation of the inverse Jacobian. To this end, AD tools automate the computation and allow a direct evaluation of the inverse Jacobian, bypassing the need for a Taylor series expansion. Thus, the enhanced version, Q1STc+, is introduced. Numerical examples are conducted to compare the performance of both element formulations for finite strain applications, with particular focus on distorted meshes. Moreover, the performance of the new element formulation for an elasto-plastic material is investigated. To validate the obtained results, a volumetric locking-free reference element based on scaled boundary parametrization is used. Both the implementation of the element routine Q1STc+ and the corresponding material subroutine are made accessible to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14259791</description>

      <title>Design of thermal meta-structures made of functionally graded materials using isogeometric density-based topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) can be efficiently designed through topology optimization to obtain thermal meta-structures that actively steer the heat flow. Compared to conventional analytical design methods, topology optimization allows handling arbitrary geometries, boundary conditions and design requirements; and producing alternate designs for non-unique problems. Additionally, as far as the design of meta-structures is concerned, topology optimization does not need intuition-based coordinate transformation or the form invariance of governing equations, as in the case of transformation thermotics. We explore isogeometric density-based topology optimization in the continuous setting, which perfectly aligns with FGMs. In this formulation, the density field, geometry and solution of the governing equations are parameterized using non-uniform rational basis spline entities. Accordingly, the heat conduction problem is solved using Isogeometric Analysis. We design various 2D &amp; 3D thermal meta-structures under different design scenarios to showcase the effectiveness and versatility of our approach. We also design thermal meta-structures based on architected cellular materials, a special class of FGMs, using their empirical material laws calculated via numerical homogenization.</description>

      <title>Four Guiding Principles for Modeling Causal Domain Knowledge: A Case Study on Brainstorming Approaches for Urban Blight Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban blight is a problem of high interest for planning and policy making. Researchers frequently propose theories about the relationships between urban blight indicators, focusing on relationships reflecting causality. In this paper, we improve on the integration of domain knowledge in the analysis of urban blight by introducing four rules for effective modeling of causal domain knowledge. The findings of this study reveal significant deviation from causal modeling guidelines by investigating cognitive maps developed for urban blight analysis. These findings provide valuable insights that will inform future work on urban blight, ultimately enhancing our understanding of urban blight complex interactions.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Markets for Differentially-Private Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data is an increasingly vital component of decision making processes across industries. However, data access raises privacy concerns motivating the need for privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy. Data markets provide a means to enable wider access as well as determine the appropriate privacy-utility trade-off. Existing data market frameworks either require a trusted third party to perform computationally expensive valuations or are unable to capture the combinatorial nature of data value and do not endogenously model the effect of differential privacy. This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a valuation mechanism based on the Wasserstein distance for differentially-private data, and corresponding procurement mechanisms by leveraging incentive mechanism design theory, for task-agnostic data procurement, and task-specific procurement co-optimisation. The mechanisms are reformulated into tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programs, which are validated with numerical studies.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Resource Allocation Framework for Microservices in Hybrid Cloud Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for scalable, efficient resource management in hybrid cloud environments has led to the exploration of AI-driven approaches for dynamic resource allocation. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for resource allocation among microservices in hybrid cloud platforms. The framework employs reinforcement learning (RL)-based resource utilization optimization to reduce costs and improve performance. The framework integrates AI models with cloud management tools to respond to challenges of dynamic scaling and cost-efficient low-latency service delivery. The reinforcement learning model continuously adjusts provisioned resources as required by the microservices and predicts the future consumption trends to minimize both under- and over-provisioning of resources. Preliminary simulation results indicate that using AI in the provision of resources related to costs can reduce expenditure by up to 30-40% compared to manual provisioning and threshold-based auto-scaling approaches. It is also estimated that the efficiency in resource utilization is expected to improve by 20%-30% with a corresponding latency cut of 15%-20% during the peak demand periods. This study compares the AI-driven approach with existing static and rule-based resource allocation methods, demonstrating the capability of this new model to outperform them in terms of flexibility and real-time interests. The results indicate that reinforcement learning can make optimization of hybrid cloud platforms even better, offering a 25-35% improvement in cost efficiency and the power of scaling for microservice-based applications. The proposed framework is a strong and scalable solution to managing cloud resources in dynamic and performance-critical environments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Partitioning Strategy for High-Dimensional Discrete Simulation-based Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a technique to enhance the computational efficiency of solution algorithms for high-dimensional discrete simulation-based optimization problems. The technique is based on innovative adaptive partitioning strategies that partition the feasible region using solutions that has already been simulated as well as prior knowledge of the problem of interesting. We integrate the proposed strategies with the Empirical Stochastic Branch-and-Bound framework proposed by Xu and Nelson (2013). This combination leads to a general-purpose discrete simulation-based optimization algorithm that is both globally convergent and has good small sample (finite-time) performance. The proposed general-purpose discrete simulation-based optimization algorithm is validated on a synthetic discrete simulation-based optimization problem and is then used to address a real-world car-sharing fleet assignment problem. Experiment results show that the proposed strategy can increase the algorithm efficiency significantly.</description>

      <title>DeTEcT: Dynamic and Probabilistic Parameters Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical extension of the DeTEcT framework proposed by Sadykhov et al., DeTEcT, where a formal analysis framework was introduced for modelling wealth distribution in token economies. DeTEcT is a framework for analysing economic activity, simulating macroeconomic scenarios, and algorithmically setting policies in token economies. This paper proposes four ways of parametrizing the framework, where dynamic vs static parametrization is considered along with the probabilistic vs non-probabilistic. Using these parametrization techniques, we demonstrate that by adding restrictions to the framework it is possible to derive the existing wealth distribution models from DeTEcT. In addition to exploring parametrization techniques, this paper studies how money supply in DeTEcT framework can be transformed to become dynamic, and how this change will affect the dynamics of wealth distribution. The motivation for studying dynamic money supply is that it enables DeTEcT to be applied to modelling token economies without maximum supply (i.e., Ethereum), and it adds constraints to the framework in the form of symmetries.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Mesh Movement Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00382v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

      <title>Relevance of the Basset history term for Lagrangian particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>

      <title>Differential Shape Optimization with Image Representation for Photonic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for differentiating shapes represented in binary images with respect to their parameters. This framework functions as an automatic differentiation tool for shape parameters, generating both binary density maps for optical simulations and computing gradients when the simulation provides a gradient of the density map. Our algorithm enables robust gradient computation that is insensitive to the image's pixel resolution and is compatible with all density-based simulation methods. We demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and generalizability of our differential shape algorithm using photonic designs with different shape parametrizations across several differentiable optical solvers. We also demonstrate a substantial reduction in optimization time using our gradient-based shape optimization framework compared to traditional black-box optimization methods.</description>
