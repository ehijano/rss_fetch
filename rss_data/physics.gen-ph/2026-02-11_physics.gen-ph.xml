      <title>Schrodinger Was Right!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Now that we have reached the centennial of Erwin Schrodinger's seminal paper introducing the wavefunction theory of matter, it is right and proper to inquire as to its legacy. It is undeniable that today every paper in atomic physics cites his 1926 equation in the first paragraph. But the philosophy undergirding the wavefunction seems to have fallen into the shadows. And Schrodinger left his program incomplete. I will argue here that recent developments in nonlinear mathematics, including so-called "chaos theory", permit finishing the task. It turns out that one nonlinear addition to his equation from 1926 can resolve both the Measurement Problem and the Randomness Problem. With this emendation, the wavefunction alone suffices to explain the outcomes of many experiments (and it is particles that can be relegated to the shadows).</description>

      <title>Revealing Gauge Constraints in LQG-Inspired Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consistent embedding of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effects within the Standard Model requires a rigorous understanding of how Planck-scale deformations manifest at low energies. While phenomenological approaches often introduce canonical deformations with multiple free parameters to capture these effects, the physical requirement of gauge symmetry in the framework of a covariant Effective Field Theory (EFT) imposes strict conditions on the allowed interaction structure. In this paper, we demonstrate that these conditions act as physical selection rules for admissible quantum gravity models. By applying non-Abelian Ward identities and a covariant operator mapping to the dimension-six operator basis, we derive a fundamental on-shell equivalence between kinetic and cubic interaction terms. As a paradigmatic application, we show that the Levy-Helayel-Neto (LHN) framework, a candidate effective description of LQG, satisfies this physical requirement only when its parameters obey the specific algebraic relation: theta_3 / theta_8 = -1/2 * [ 1 + theta_7 * (ell_P / L)^(2 + 2 Upsilon) ] + O(ell_P). It must be highlighted that this result advances the physical understanding of LQG phenomenology by revealing that the apparent freedom in defining the Hamiltonian is illusory; the parameters are bound by the necessity of preserving the gauge structure of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints and Geometric Diagnostics of Barboza-Alcaniz and Logarithmic Dark Energy Parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates and compares two prominent two-dimensional dark energy (DE) parameterizations: Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) and Logarithmic forms by comparing them with a comprehensive set of observational data comprising Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Pantheon compilation, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (DESI BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC). The primary objective was to explore the constraining power and cosmological implications of each parameterization in light of the current data. After formulating the theoretical framework and background equations governing cosmic expansion, we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques using the emcee Python package to constrain the free parameters of each model. The best-fit values for parameters $\omega_0$, $\omega_a$, and $H_0$ were extracted for each model using individual and combined datasets. The results include confidence contours at the levels $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$. Our findings demonstrate that both parameterizations are consistent with observational data, with logarithmic parameterization showing slightly better constraints in terms of parameter evolution. Furthermore, we employed a statefinder diagnostic to analyze the geometric behavior of the models, providing an effective distinction between the two DE scenarios. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of DE evolution and its constraints in light of current cosmological data.</description>
