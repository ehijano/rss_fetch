      <title>Equivariant elliptic cohomology and the 2-loop groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following an outline of Rezk, we give a construction of complex-analytic $G$-equivariant elliptic cohomology for an arbitrary compact Lie group $G$ and we prove some of its fundamental properties. The construction is parametrised over the orbit category of the groupoid of principal $G$-bundles over 2-dimensional tori and generalises Grojnowski's construction of equivariant elliptic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral coproducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dualising the construction of a polyhedral product, we introduce the notion of a polyhedral coproduct as a certain homotopy limit over the face poset of a simplicial complex. We begin a study of the basic properties of polyhedral coproducts, surveying the Eckmann-Hilton duals of various familiar examples and properties of polyhedral products. In particular, we show that polyhedral coproducts give a functorial interpolation between the wedge and cartesian product of spaces which differs from the one given by polyhedral products, and we establish a general loop space decomposition for these spaces which is dual to the suspension splitting of a polyhedral product due to Bahri, Bendersky, Cohen and Gitler.</description>

      <title>Morse Theory for Chromatic Delaunay Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic alpha filtration is a generalization of the alpha filtration that can encode spatial relationships among classes of labelled point cloud data, and has applications in topological data analysis of multi-species data. In this paper we introduce the chromatic Delaunay--\v{C}ech and chromatic Delaunay--Rips filtrations, which are computationally favourable alternatives to the chromatic alpha filtration. We use generalized discrete Morse theory to show that the \v{C}ech, chromatic Delaunay--\v{C}ech, and chromatic alpha filtrations are related by simplicial collapses. Our result generalizes a result of Bauer and Edelsbrunner from the non-chromatic to the chromatic setting. We also show that the chromatic Delaunay--Rips filtration is locally stable to perturbations of the underlying point cloud. Our results provide theoretical justification for the use of chromatic Delaunay--\v{C}ech and chromatic Delaunay--Rips filtrations in applications, and we demonstrate their computational advantage with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A general Greenlees-May splitting principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In equivariant topology, Greenlees and May used Mackey functors to show that, rationally, the stable homotopy category of $G$-spectra over a finite group $G$ splits as a product of simpler module categories. We extend the algebraic part (also independently proved by Th\'evenaz and Webb) of this classical result to Mackey modules over an arbitrary Green functor, and use the case of the complex representation ring Green functor to obtain an algebraic model of the rational equivariant Kasparov category of $G$-cell algebras.</description>

      <title>On the string topology of symmetric spaces of higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09350v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homology of the free and the based loop space of a compact globally symmetric space can be studied through explicit cycles. We use cycles constructed by Bott and Samelson and by Ziller to study the string topology coproduct and the Chas-Sullivan product on compact symmetric spaces. We show that the Chas-Sullivan product for compact symmetric spaces is highly non-trivial for any rank and we prove that there are many non-nilpotent classes whose powers correspond to the iteration of closed geodesics. Moreover, we show that the based string topology coproduct is trivial for compact symmetric spaces of higher rank and we study the implications of this result for the string topology coproduct on the free loop space.</description>

      <title>Torus orbit closures in the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of torus orbit closures in the (complete) flag variety was initiated by Klyachko and Gelfand--Serganova in the mid-1980s, but it seems that not much has been done since then. In this chapter, we present some of the work by Klyachko and Gelfand--Serganova and our recent work on the topology, geometry, and combinatorics of torus orbit closures in the flag variety.</description>

      <title>Anyonic Topological Order in Twisted Equivariant Differential (TED) K-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the classification of non-interacting crystalline topological insulator phases by equivariant K-theory has become widely accepted, its generalization to anyonic interacting phases -- hence to phases with topologically ordered ground states supporting topological braid quantum gates -- has remained wide open. On the contrary, the success of K-theory with classifying non-interacting phases seems to have tacitly been perceived as precluding a K-theoretic classification of interacting topological order; and instead a mix of other proposals has been explored. However, only K-theory connects closely to the actual physics of valence electrons; and self-consistency demands that any other proposal must connect to K-theory.
  Here we provide a detailed argument for the classification of symmetry protected/enhanced su(2)-anyonic topological order, specifically in interacting 2d semi-metals, by the twisted equivariant differential (TED) K-theory of configuration spaces of points in the complement of nodal points inside the crystal's Brillouin torus orbi-orientifold.
  We argue, in particular, that: (1) topological 2d semi-metal phases modulo global mass terms are classified by the flat differential twisted equivariant K-theory of the complement of the nodal points; (2) n-electron interacting phases are classified by the K-theory of configuration spaces of n points in the Brillouin torus; (3) the somewhat neglected twisting of equivariant K-theory by "inner local systems" reflects the effective "fictitious" gauge interaction of Chen, Wilczeck, Witten &amp; Halperin (1989), which turns fermions into anyonic quanta; (4) the induced su(2)-anyonic topological order is reflected in the twisted Chern classes of the interacting valence bundle over configuration space, constituting the hypergeometric integral construction of monodromy braid representations.</description>

Abstract: For a semisimple complex algebraic group $G$ we determine the rational cohomology and the Hodge-Tate structure of the moduli stack ${\mathscr B}un_{G,X}$ of principal $G$-bundles over a connected smooth complex projective variety $X$ of special type using the homotopy theory of the underlying topological stack.</description>
