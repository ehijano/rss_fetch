      <title>Single-neuron deep generative model uncovers underlying physics of neuronal activity in Ca imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcium imaging has become a powerful alternative to electrophysiology for studying neuronal activity, offering spatial resolution and the ability to measure large populations of neurons in a minimally invasive manner. This technique has broad applications in neuroscience, neuroengineering, and medicine, enabling researchers to explore the relationship between neuron location and activity. Recent advancements in deep generative models (DGMs) have facilitated the modeling of neuronal population dynamics, uncovering latent representations that provide insights into behavior prediction and neuronal variance. However, these models often rely on spike inference algorithms and primarily focus on population-level dynamics, limiting their applicability for single-neuron analyses. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for single-neuron representation learning using autoregressive variational autoencoders (AVAEs). Our approach embeds individual neurons' spatiotemporal signals into a reduced-dimensional space without the need for spike inference algorithms. The AVAE excels over traditional linear methods by generating more informative and discriminative latent representations, improving tasks such as visualization, clustering, and the understanding of neuronal activity. Additionally, the reconstruction performance of the AVAE outperforms the state of the art, demonstrating its ability to accurately recover the original fluorescence signal from the learned representation. Using realistic simulations, we show that our model captures underlying physical properties and connectivity patterns, enabling it to distinguish between different firing and connectivity types. These findings position the AVAE as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing single-neuron analysis and lays the groundwork for future integration of multimodal single-cell datasets in neuroscience.</description>

Abstract: Mental disorders have become a significant global public health issue, while the shortage of psychiatrists and inefficient training systems severely hinder the accessibility of mental health services. This paper designs and implements an artificial intelligence-based training system for psychiatrists. By integrating technologies such as large language models, knowledge graphs, and expert systems, the system constructs an intelligent and standardized training platform. It includes six functional modules: case generation, consultation dialogue, examination prescription, diagnostic decision-making, integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine prescription, and expert evaluation, providing comprehensive support from clinical skill training to professional level assessment.The system adopts a B/S architecture, developed using the Vue.js and Node.js technology stack, and innovatively applies deep learning algorithms for case generation and doctor-patient dialogue. In a clinical trial involving 60 psychiatrists at different levels, the system demonstrated excellent performance and training outcomes: system stability reached 99.95%, AI dialogue accuracy achieved 96.5%, diagnostic accuracy reached 92.5%, and user satisfaction scored 92.3%. Experimental data showed that doctors using the system improved their knowledge mastery, clinical thinking, and diagnostic skills by 35.6%, 28.4%, and 23.7%, respectively.The research results provide an innovative solution for improving the efficiency of psychiatrist training and hold significant importance for promoting the standardization and scalability of mental health professional development.</description>

      <title>Latency correction in sparse neuronal spike trains with overlapping global events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: In Kreuz et al., J Neurosci Methods 381, 109703 (2022) two methods were proposed that perform latency correction, i.e., optimize the spike time alignment of sparse neuronal spike trains with well defined global spiking events. The first one based on direct shifts is fast but uses only partial latency information, while the other one makes use of the full information but relies on the computationally costly simulated annealing. Both methods reach their limits and can become unreliable when successive global events are not sufficiently separated or even overlap.
  New Method: Here we propose an iterative scheme that combines the advantages of the two original methods by using in each step as much of the latency information as possible and by employing a very fast extrapolation direct shift method instead of the much slower simulated annealing.
  Results: We illustrate the effectiveness and the improved performance, measured in terms of the relative shift error, of the new iterative scheme not only on simulated data with known ground truths but also on single-unit recordings from two medial superior olive neurons of a gerbil.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The iterative scheme outperforms the existing approaches on both the simulated and the experimental data. Due to its low computational demands, and in contrast to simulated annealing, it can also be applied to very large datasets.
  Conclusions: The new method generalizes and improves on the original method both in terms of accuracy and speed. Importantly, it is the only method that allows to disentangle global events with overlap.</description>

      <title>Classification of Major Depressive Disorder Using Vertex-Wise Brain Sulcal Depth, Curvature, and Thickness with a Deep and a Shallow Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11046</link>

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric disorder that affects the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe. Even today, researchers debate if morphological alterations in the brain are linked to MDD, likely due to the heterogeneity of this disorder. The application of deep learning tools to neuroimaging data, capable of capturing complex non-linear patterns, has the potential to provide diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for MDD. However, previous attempts to demarcate MDD patients and healthy controls (HC) based on segmented cortical features via linear machine learning approaches have reported low accuracies. Here, we used globally representative data from the ENIGMA-MDD working group containing 7,012 participants from 30 sites (N=2,772 MDD and N=4,240 HC), which allows a comprehensive analysis with generalizable results. Based on the hypothesis that integration of vertex-wise cortical features can improve classification performance, we evaluated the classification of a DenseNet and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the expectation that the former would outperform the latter. We found that both classifiers exhibited close to chance performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 51%; SVM: 53%), when estimated on unseen sites. Slightly higher classification performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 58%; SVM: 55%) was found when the cross-validation folds contained subjects from all sites, indicating site effect. In conclusion, the integration of vertex-wise morphometric features and the use of the non-linear classifier did not lead to the differentiability between MDD and HC. Our results support the notion that MDD classification on this combination of such features and classifiers is unfeasible. Perhaps more sophisticated integration of multimodal information may lead to a higher performance in this diagnostic task.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization Index: a New Approach for Exploring Complex Epileptogenic Networks in Stereoelectroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective. In this work, we propose a new computational framework to assist neurophysiologists in Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) analysis, with the final aim of improving the definition of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Method. We consider the Phase Transfer Entropy (PTE) model to estimate the effective connectivity between SEEG channels. Hence, we design an algorithm, named the Desynchronization Index (DI), that classifies as epileptogenic the channels that show independent behavior with respect to the rest of the network during the seconds preceding the seizure propagation. Results. We test the proposed DI algorithm against Epileptogenic Index (EI) on a clinical dataset of 11 patients, considering the neurophysiological evaluation of the EZ as the clinical ground truth. Our results denote that DI overcomes EI in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC=0.80 vs AUC=0.74), while combining the two algorithms as a unique tool leads to the best performance (AUC=0.87). Conclusions. The DI algorithm underscores connectivity dynamics that can hardly be identified with a pure visual analysis, increasing the accuracy in the EZ definition compared to traditional methods. Significance. The integration of connectivity- and energy-based metrics, as the one we propose, can lead to the definition of a new effective biomarker of the EZ, reducing the burden required by the SEEG review in the case of extensive implants and improving our understanding of the dynamics leading to the generation of seizures.</description>

      <title>A Fuzzy-based Approach to Predict Human Interaction by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a Fuzzy-based Attention (Fuzzy Attention Layer) mechanism, a novel computational approach to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of neural models in psychological research. The proposed Fuzzy Attention Layer mechanism is integrated as a neural network layer within the Transformer Encoder model to facilitate the analysis of complex psychological phenomena through neural signals, such as those captured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). By leveraging fuzzy logic, the Fuzzy Attention Layer is capable of learning and identifying interpretable patterns of neural activity. This capability addresses a significant challenge when using Transformer: the lack of transparency in determining which specific brain activities most contribute to particular predictions. Our experimental results demonstrated on fNIRS data from subjects engaged in social interactions involving handholding reveal that the Fuzzy Attention Layer not only learns interpretable patterns of neural activity but also enhances model performance. Additionally, the learned patterns provide deeper insights into the neural correlates of interpersonal touch and emotional exchange. The application of our model shows promising potential in deciphering the subtle complexities of human social behaviors, thereby contributing significantly to the fields of social neuroscience and psychological AI.</description>
