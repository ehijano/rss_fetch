      <title>Self-consistent solution to the semiclassical Einstein equations of a star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the interior solution for a static, spherically symmetric perfect fluid star backreacted by QFT in four dimensions invoking no arbitrary parameters. It corresponds to a constant energy density star and is fully non-perturbative. The space of solutions includes ultra-compact configurations that have neither singularities nor light rings inside the star and can exist arbitrarily close to the Schwarzschild limit, showing that the classical paradigm of astrophysics does not hold once QFT in curved space is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in extreme mass ratio inspirals: perturbations to the environment in Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observatories open a unique avenue to study the environments surrounding black holes. Intermediate or extreme mass ratio inspirals will spend thousands to millions of cycles in the sensitivity range of detectors, allowing subtle environmental effects to accumulate in the gravitational waveform. Working in Lorenz gauge and considering equatorial circular orbits, we present the first self-consistent, fully relativistic calculation of a perturbation to a black hole environment due to an inspiraling secondary in the Kerr geometry. As an example case, we consider the environment to be that of a superradiantly grown scalar cloud, though our framework is generalizable to other scenarios. We demonstrate that the scalar field develops a rich wake structure induced by the secondary and compute scalar fluxes emitted to infinity and through the horizon. Relative differences in the fluxes compared to Schwarzschild are tens of percent on large intervals of parameter space, underscoring the importance of modeling in Kerr.</description>

      <title>Soliton methods and the black hole balance problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is an extended version of a presentation given at KOZWaves 2024: The 6th Australasian Conference on Wave Science, held in Dunedin, New Zealand.
  Soliton methods were initially introduced to study equations such as the Korteweg--de Vries equation, which describes nonlinear water waves. Interestingly, the same methods can also be used to analyse equilibrium configurations in general relativity. An intriguing open problem is whether a relativistic $n$-body system can be in stationary equilibrium. Due to the nonlinear effect of spin-spin repulsion of rotating objects, and possibly considering charged bodies with additional electromagnetic repulsion, the existence of such unusual configurations remains a possibility. An important example is a (hypothetical) equilibrium configuration with $n$ aligned black holes. By studying a linear matrix problem equivalent to the Einstein equations for axisymmetric and stationary (electro-) vacuum spacetimes, we derive the most general form of the boundary data on the symmetry axis in terms of a finite number of parameters. In the simplest case $n=1$, this leads to a constructive uniqueness proof of the Kerr (-Newman) solution. For $n=2$ and vacuum, we obtain non-existence of stationary two-black-hole configurations. For $n=2$ with electrovacuum, and for larger $n$, it remains an open problem whether the well-defined finite solution families contain any physically reasonable solutions, i.e.\ spacetimes without anomalies such as naked singularities, magnetic monopoles, and struts.</description>

      <title>Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. By incorporating the effects of Lorentz-violating term $\ell$ and the monopole charge $\eta$ in the KR field, we derive the modified gravitational field equations and analyze the resulting black hole spacetime. The obtained solution exhibits deviations from the Schwarzschild metric with topological defect, as it is influenced by the monopole charge and self-interaction potential. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, revealing novel stability conditions. Additionally, we perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge. Our findings suggest that these parameters have to be significantly small, although there are different constraints imposed by individual tests, ranging from $10^{-9}\leq|\ell|\leq 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-9}\leq\eta\leq 10^{-6}\, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Infrared Behavior of Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Induced gravitational waves provide a powerful probe of primordial perturbations in the early universe through their distinctive spectral properties. We analyze the spectral energy density $\Omega_{\text{GW}}$ of gravitational waves induced by isocurvature scalar perturbations. In the infrared regime, we find that the spectral slope $n_{\text{GW}} \equiv \text{d} \ln\Omega_\mathrm{GW}/\text{d}\ln k$ takes the log-dependent form $3-4/ \ln (\tilde{k}_*^2 / 6k^2)$, where $\tilde{k}_*$ represents the effective peak scale of the primordial scalar power spectrum. This characteristic behavior differs markedly from that of adiabatic-induced gravitational waves, establishing a robust observational discriminant between isocurvature and adiabatic primordial perturbation modes.</description>

      <title>A state sum for four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum geometry in terms of edge vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the construction of a new state sum model for $4d$ Lorentzian quantum gravity based on the description of quantum simplicial geometry in terms of edge vectors. Quantum states and amplitudes for simplicial geometry are built from irreducible representations of the translation group, then related to the representations of the Lorentz group via expansors, leading to interesting (and intricate) non-commutative structures. We also show how the new model connects to the Lorentzian Barrett-Crane spin foam model, formulated in terms of quantized triangle bivectors.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Within the framework of the Standard Model, the production of PBHs through well-tested physical processes is highly worthy of investigations. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations of energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formations in the primordial universe. We analyze the abundance and mass range of PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition, and, remarkably, without invoking any new physics beyond the Standard Model, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the only allowed ``asteroid mass'' window from current joint observations, and their abundance constitutes approximately 20\% of the total mass and energy of the universe. These findings strongly suggest that PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Rotating spacetimes with a free scalar field in four and five dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit rotating solutions in Einstein's theory of relativity with a minimally coupled free scalar field rederiving and finding solutions in four or five spacetime dimensions. These spacetimes describe, in particular, the back-reaction of a free scalar field evolving in a Kerr spacetime. Adapting the general integrability result obtained many years ago from Eri\c{s}-G\"{u}rses to simpler spherical coordinates, we present a method for rederiving the four-dimensional Bogush-Gal'tsov solution. Furthermore, we find the five-dimensional spacetime featuring a free scalar with two distinct angular momenta. In the static limit, these five-dimensional geometries provide higher-dimensional extensions of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime. Last but not least, we obtain the four-dimensional version of a Kerr-Newman-NUT spacetime endowed with a free scalar, where the scalar field's radial profile is extended to incorporate dependence on the polar angular coordinate. Our results offer a comprehensive analysis of several recently proposed four-dimensional static solutions with scalar multipolar hair, representing a unified study of spacetimes with a free scalar field in both four and five dimensions under the general integrability result of Eri\c{s}-G\"{u}rses.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for extracting tidal information from neutron star binary mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs regarding the detection of compact binary mergers via gravitational waves opened up a new window to the Universe. Gravitational-wave models have been essential to this success since they are necessary to infer the properties of the compact binary system from the observational data. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, will allow for more observations of binary neutron star mergers with higher precision, making accurate waveform models crucial in describing these systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach for constructing phenomenological waveform models informed by observational data. Using mock data representing a one-year operation of the Einstein Telescope as our baseline, we demonstrate how the results improve as more events are included in the calibration. This method offers a new and complementary approach for developing sophisticated gravitational-wave models compared to classical techniques that employ analytical computations and numerical-relativity simulations. Improved waveform models will then yield more accurate parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Modular global-fit pipeline for LISA data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We anticipate that the data acquired by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be dominated by the gravitational wave signals from several astrophysical populations. The analysis of these data is a new challenge and is the main focus of this paper. Numerous gravitational wave signals overlap in the time and/or frequency domain, and the possible correlation between them has to be taken into account during their detection and characterization. In this work, we present a method to address the LISA data analysis challenge; it is flexible and scalable for a number of sources and across several populations. Its performance is demonstrated on the simulated data LDC2a.</description>

      <title>Near-Boundary Asymptotics and Unique Continuation for the AdS--Einstein--Maxwell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the results of both Shao and Holzegel-Shao to the AdS-Einstein-Maxwell system $({M}, g, F)$. We study the asymptotics of the metric $g$ and the Maxwell field $F$ near the conformal boundary ${I}$ for the fully nonlinear coupled system. Furthermore, we characterise the holographic (boundary) data used in the second part of this work.
  We also prove the local unique continuation property for solutions of the coupled Einstein equations from the conformal boundary. Specifically, the prescription of the coefficients $(\mathfrak{g}^{(0)}, \mathfrak{g}^{(n)})$ in the near-boundary expansion of $g$, along with the boundary data for the Maxwell fields $(\mathfrak{f}^{0}, \mathfrak{f}^{1})$, on a domain ${D} \subset {I}$ uniquely determines $(g, F)$ near ${D}$. The geometric conditions required for unique continuation are identical to those in the vacuum case, regardless of the presence of the Maxwell fields.
  This work is part of the author's thesis.</description>

      <title>Scattering, Polyhomogeneity and Asymptotics for Quasilinear Wave Equations From Past to Future Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general construction of semiglobal scattering solutions to quasilinear wave equations in a neighbourhood of spacelike infinity including past and future null infinity, where the scattering data are posed on an ingoing null cone and along past null infinity. More precisely, we prove weighted, optimal-in-decay energy estimates and propagation of polyhomogeneity statements from past to future null infinity for these solutions, we provide an algorithmic procedure how to compute the precise coefficients in the arising polyhomogeneous expansions, and we apply this procedure to various examples. As a corollary, our results directly imply the summability in the spherical harmonic number $\ell$ of the estimates proved for fixed spherical harmonic modes in the papers [Keh22b,KM24] from the series "The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity".
  Our (physical space) methods are based on weighted energy estimates near spacelike infinity similar to those of [HV23], commutations with (modified) scaling vector fields to remove leading order terms in the relevant expansions, time inversions, as well as the Minkowskian conservation laws: $$
  \partial_u(r^{-2\ell}\partial_v(r^2\partial_v)^{\ell}(r\phi_{\ell}))=0, $$ which are satisfied if $\Box_\eta\phi=0$. Our scattering constructions go beyond the usual class of finite energy solutions and, as a consequence, can be applied directly to the Einstein vacuum equations in harmonic gauge.</description>

      <title>General relativistic particle trajectories via quantum mechanical weak values and the Schwarzschild-Alcubierre spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the average trajectories of relativistic quantum particles in Schwarzschild spacetime, obtained via quantum mechanical weak measurements of momentum and energy, are equivalent to the predicted flow lines of probability current in curved spacetime quantum theory. We subsequently demonstrate that these trajectories correspond exactly to classical null geodesics in a hybrid Schwarzschild-Alcubierre spacetime. This threefold equivalence demonstrates how quantum theory in curved spacetime can be formulated via operationally-defined measurements, and that such a theory may be interpreted deterministically, in the spirit of hidden-variable models such as Bohmian mechanics, through the novel connection to an underlying "guiding metric."</description>

      <title>Holographic Bound of Casimir Effect in General Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed that holography imposes a universal lower bound on the Casimir effect for 3d BCFTs. This paper generalizes the discussions to higher dimensions. We find Einstein gravity, DGP gravity, and Gauss-Bonnet gravity sets a universal lower bound of the strip Casimir effect in general dimensions. We verify the holographic bound by free theories and $O(N)$ models in the $\epsilon$ expansions. We also derive the holographic bound of the Casimir effect for a wedge and confirm free theories obey it. It implies holography sets a lower bound of the Casimir effect for general boundary shapes, not limited to the strip. Finally, we briefly comment on the impact of mass and various generalizations and applications of our results.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Multi-Wavelength Analysis of a New Dissociative Galaxy Merger: The Champagne Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new binary galaxy cluster merger, the Champagne Cluster (RM J130558.9+263048.4), using a detection method that identifies dynamically active clusters in the redMaPPer SDSS DR8 photometric galaxy cluster catalog. The Champagne Cluster exhibits the classic X-ray morphology of a post-pericenter dissociative galaxy cluster merger: an X-ray peak located between two galaxy overdensities at the same redshift. We conducted a Keck/DEIMOS survey and obtained redshifts for 103 member galaxies. The redshift analysis indicates a relative velocity of 411 $\pm$ 180 km/s between the two subclusters, which suggests that the merger is happening near the plane of the sky. We used cosmological simulations to find analogous systems to constrain the time since pericenter (74-250 Myr) and the angle the merger axis makes with the plane of the sky (62$^\circ$-90$^\circ$) at the 68$\%$ confidence level. We estimated the bulk temperature (8.20 $\pm 1.2$ keV) and total X-ray luminosity (5.2 $\pm$ 0.8 $\times$ $10^{44}$ erg $\times$ $s^{-1}$) of the intracluster medium using $\textit{Chandra}$ archival data.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a manifold of a system with internal degrees of freedom, such as Lorentz symmetry or gauge symmetry, the ``curvature'' is defined for the manifold. If one defines the local vacuum in the tangent space of the manifold, one can define a local mapping in the vicinity of the contact point, which is nothing but the Bogoliubov transformation. The curvature of the electromagnetic field gives the Schwinger effect, and the curvature of the base space introduces the local Unruh effect, which realizes Hawking radiation if applied on the Black hole horizon. To show how the Bogoliubov transformation appears on the manifold and why the local calculation is crucial there, we consider the Schwinger effect with a slowly varying electric field. Then, we show what happens in the Unruh effect if the acceleration is not a constant parameter.</description>

      <title>Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field, which admits viable solutions of bouncing universe satisfying the following requirements: (i) absence of Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) instability, ghost and gradient instability, (ii) absence of superluminality, (iii) generation of nearly scale-invariant curvature perturbations and very small tensor-to-scalar ratio, and (iv) conventional asymptotics in the distant past and future, where gravity sector is described by General Relativity and the DHOST scalar has a canonical form of Lagrangian. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis in the presence of density perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out a new effect on the freeze-out process of heavy particles induced by density perturbations in the early universe, which we call ``acoustically driven freeze-out.'' This beyond-linear effect is caused by the exponential decoupling of heavy particles from the thermal bath in the presence of density perturbations, and already at moderately large values $\delta T / \bar{T} = O (10^{-2})$ it cannot be captured by linear perturbation theory. We illustrate this effect with leptogenesis taking the decay and inverse decay of heavy neutrinos into account, and discuss its phenomenological implications. We found that perturbations always enhance the (spatially averaged) values of the final lepton asymmetry, and as a result, constraints on the mass of heavy neutrinos are found to be relaxed in the presence of perturbations.</description>

      <title>Binary superfluids: low-energy properties and dissipative processes from spontaneous emission of massive phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.</description>

      <title>No evidence that the binary black hole mass distribution evolves with redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass distribution of merging binary black holes is generically predicted to evolve with redshift, reflecting systematic changes in their astrophysical environment, stellar progenitors, and/or dominant formation channels over cosmic time. Whether or not such an effect is observed in gravitational-wave data, however, remains an open question, with some contradictory results present in the literature. In this paper, we study the ensemble of binary black holes within the latest GWTC-3 catalog released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, systematically surveying for possible evolution of their mass distribution with redshift. We specifically focus on two key features present in the binary black hole primary mass distribution -- (1) an excess of $35\,M_\odot$ black holes and (2) a broad power-law continuum ranging from 10 to $\gtrsim 80 M_\odot$ -- and ask if one or both of these features are observed to vary with redshift. We find no evidence that either the Gaussian peak or power-law continuum components of the mass distribution change with redshift. In some cases, we place somewhat stringent bounds on the degree of allowed redshift evolution. Most notably, we find that the mean location of the $35\,M_\odot$ peak and the slope of the power-law continuum are constrained to remain approximately constant below redshift $z\approx 1$. The data remain more agnostic about other forms of redshift dependence, such as evolution in the height of the $35\,M_\odot$ excess or the minimum and maximum black hole masses. In all cases, we conclude that a redshift-dependent mass spectrum remains possible, but that it is not required by current data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining asymptotically safe quantum gravity with a tensor field theory, we exhibit the first example of a theory with gravity and scalar fields in four dimensions which may realize asymptotic safety at a non-vanishing value of the scalar quartic coupling.
  We first present (further) evidence that in the asymptotic-safety paradigm, quantum fluctuations of gravity generically screen the quartic couplings in (multi-)scalar models. For a tensor field theory in which the scalar field transforms under an internal $O(N)^3$ symmetry, this has the effect of replacing asymptotic freedom, recently discovered at large $N$ on a fixed flat background, by an interacting fixed point in the presence of quantum gravity. The fixed point originates from the competition between the effects of the matter self-interactions which, contrary to the usual scalar models, are antiscreening, and the screening gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Sign Switching in Dark Sector Coupling Interactions as a Candidate for Resolving Cosmological Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations, but is increasingly challenged by the emergence of cosmological tensions, particularly the Hubble Tension $H_0$ and the $S_8$ tension. The Hubble Tension, with a significance above 5$\sigma$, and the $S_8$ tension, showing a discrepancy of approximately 2-4$\sigma$, highlight inconsistencies between measurements of the local and early universe. This paper expands a well-established Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) phenomenological scenario, where dark matter (DM) can transfer energy to dark energy (DE) or vice versa, depending on the sign of the coupling parameter $\xi$. The novel feature consists in a transition mechanism which reverses the direction of the energy-momentum transfer after the redshift where the densities of the dark species are the same. We evaluate this model using a comprehensive set of recent observational data, including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the DESI survey, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5 and Union3 samples, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis shows that this scenario can potentially relax both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions simultaneously. We find the new model to be weakly preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by BAO-DESI data. However, we show that the IDE model features positive Bayesian evidence compared to $\Lambda$CDM only when Cepheid distance calibration in the SH0ES sample is used to calibrate SNIa data from PantheonPlus.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Holography via Quantum Coherence on Causal Horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12080v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is much recent development towards interferometric measurements of holographic quantum uncertainties in an emergent background space-time. Despite increasing promise for the target detection regime of Planckian strain power spectral density, the foundational insights of the motivating theories have not been connected to a phenomenological model of observables measured in a realistic experiment. This work proposes a candidate model, based on the central hypothesis that all horizons are universal boundaries of coherent quantum information -- where the decoherence of space-time happens for the observer. The prediction is inspired by 't Hooft's algebra for black hole information that gives coherent states on horizons, whose spatial correlations were shown by Verlinde and Zurek to also appear on holographic fluctuations of causal boundaries in flat space-time (conformal Killing horizons). Time-domain correlations are projected from Planckian jitters whose coherence scales match causal diamonds, motivated by Banks' framework for the emergence of space-time and locality. The universality of this coherence on causal horizons compels a multimodal research program probing concordant signatures: An analysis of cosmological data to probe primordial correlations, motivated by Hogan's interpretation of well-known CMB anomalies as coherent fluctuations on the inflationary horizon, and upcoming 3D interferometers to probe causal diamonds in flat space-time. Candidate interferometer geometries are presented, with a modeled frequency spectrum for each design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is univocally anticipated that in a theory of quantum gravity, there exist quantum superpositions of semiclassical states of spacetime geometry. Such states could arise for example, from a source mass in a superposition of spatial configurations. In this paper we introduce a framework for describing such "quantum superpositions of spacetime states." We introduce the notion of the relativity of spacetime superpositions, demonstrating that for states in which the superposed amplitudes differ by a coordinate transformation, it is always possible to re-express the scenario in terms of dynamics on a single, fixed background. Our result unveils an inherent ambiguity in labelling such superpositions as genuinely quantum-gravitational, which has been done extensively in the literature, most notably with reference to recent proposals to test gravitationally-induced entanglement. We apply our framework to the above mentioned scenarios looking at gravitationally-induced entanglement, the problem of decoherence of gravitational sources, and clarify commonly overlooked assumptions. In the context of decoherence of gravitational sources, our result implies that the resulting decoherence is not fundamental, but depends on the existence of external systems that define a relative set of coordinates through which the notion of spatial superposition obtains physical meaning.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy Implies Varying-G: Horizon Area Dependent Field Equations and Black Hole-Cosmology Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified, ambiguity often arises concerning whether the Hawking temperature or the thermodynamic mass should be modified. The common practice, however, is to keep the black hole solution the same as that in general relativity. On the other hand, if Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, and then look for the compatible black hole solution before investigating its thermodynamics. We comment on some properties and subtleties in this approach. In particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational "constant" theory, where $G_\text{eff}$ depends on the horizon area. We discuss in what ways such theories are discernible from general relativity despite its seemingly jarring differences, and how to make sense of area-dependent field equations. As a consequence we show that in the Jacobson's approach, the standard quantum gravitational logarithmic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is equivalent to a running gravitational "constant". A horizon area dependent $G_\text{eff}$ could also lead to a coupling between black hole masses and cosmological expansion, a scenario that has been studied recently in the literature, but so far lacks strong theoretical motivation. In the Tsallis case, we show that the thermodynamic mass for a Schwarzschild black hole is just a constant multiple of its ADM mass, which is considerably simpler than the approach not utilizing the Jacobson's method.</description>

Abstract: The Hawking temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole can be heuristically derived by identifying the temperature with the inverse radius of the horizon up to a multiplicative constant. This does not work for more general black holes such as the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions. Expounding on the details of how it fails to work nevertheless uncovers interesting connections with the "spring constant" of black holes and with black hole thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We address a dynamical, spherically symmetric background in beyond Horndeski theory and formulate a set of linear stability conditions for high energy perturbation modes above an arbitrary solution. In this general setting we derive speeds of propagation in both radial and angular directions for gravity waves and compare them with the speed of light in the case of minimally coupled photon. In particular, we find that the class of beyond Horndeski theories, which satisfy the equality of gravity waves' speed to the speed of light over a cosmological background, feature gravity waves propagating at luminal speeds above a time-dependent inhomogeneous background as well.</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>Non-singular cosmological scenarios in scalar-tensor theories and their stability: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article gives a concise overview of the development and current status of studies on healthy models of the early Universe without an initial singularity, namely the cosmological bounce and Genesis scenarios, constructed within a broad class of scalar-tensor theories, specifically Horndeski theories and their generalizations. The review focuses on the topics related to linear stability at the perturbation level over the non-singular background solutions: 1) the no-go theorem, valid for non-singular cosmologies within Horndeski theory, 2) the updates on possible approaches to evade the no-go theorem, 3) the role of disformal transformations relating the Horndeski subclasses with the generalized theories like DHOST, 4) the effects on stability caused by additional matter coupling and potential emergence of superluminal perturbation modes in the multi-component setting.</description>

      <title>Black-Hole Cartography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes (QNMs) are usually characterized by their time dependence; oscillations at specific frequencies predicted by black hole (BH) perturbation theory. QNMs are routinely identified in the ringdown of numerical relativity waveforms, are widely used in waveform modeling, and underpin key tests of general relativity and of the nature of compact objects; a program sometimes called BH spectroscopy. Perturbation theory also predicts a specific spatial shape for each QNM perturbation. For the Kerr metric, these are the ($s=-2$) spheroidal harmonics. Spatial information can be extracted from numerical relativity by fitting a feature with known time dependence to all of the spherical harmonic modes, allowing the shape of the feature to be reconstructed; a program initiated here and that we call BH cartography. Accurate spatial reconstruction requires fitting to many spherical harmonics and is demonstrated using highly accurate Cauchy-characteristic numerical relativity waveforms. The loudest QNMs are mapped, and their reconstructed shapes are found to match the spheroidal harmonic predictions. The cartographic procedure is also applied to the quadratic QNMs -- nonlinear features in the ringdown -- and their reconstructed shapes are compared with expectations based on second-order perturbation theory. BH cartography allows us to determine the viewing angles that maximize the amplitude of the quadratic QNMs, an important guide for future searches, and is expected to lead to an improved understanding of nonlinearities in BH ringdown.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hawking radiation of the quantum Oppenheimer- Snyde black hole with the tunneling scheme by Parikh and Wilczek. We calculate the emission rate of massless scalar particles. Compared to the traditional results within the framework of General Relativity, our findings include quantum correction terms arising from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the approach in [1, 2], we establish the entropy of the black hole. This entropy includes a logarithmic correction, which arises from quantum gravity effects. Our result is consistent with the well-known result in the context of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>The Case For Black Hole Remnants: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been almost 40 years since the proposal of the idea that Hawking radiation of black holes does not lead to a complete evaporation but rather a "remnant" state. Though traditionally viewed with great criticisms especially from the high energy physics community, in recent years, various approaches have demonstrated that black hole remnants remain a viable possibility. In this review, which is primarily aimed as an introduction to the subject, we will discuss some possible routes to forming remnants and their respective properties and challenges.</description>

      <title>A geometric template bank for the detection of spinning low-mass compact binaries with moderate orbital eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binaries on eccentric orbits are another class of gravitational-wave (GW) sources that can provide a wealth of information on binary formation pathways and astrophysical environments. However, historically, eccentricity is often neglected in modelled GW searches for compact binaries. We show that currently used modelled searches that employ quasi-circular template banks are highly ineffectual in detecting binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems with orbital eccentricities in the range of $[10^{-5},0.15]$ at a GW frequency of $15$Hz. For populations of moderately eccentric BNS and NSBH binaries with (anti-)aligned component spins, we demonstrate that quasi-circular template banks fail to detect up to $\sim 40\%$ of such systems. To alleviate these inefficiencies, we develop the first \emph{geometric} template bank for the search of BNSs and NSBH binaries that includes masses, (anti-)aligned spins and moderate eccentricity. Utilising the post-Newtonian inspiral waveform {\tt TaylorF2Ecc} and a global coordinate transformation, we construct a globally flat metric to efficiently place eccentric templates. Our geometric template bank is highly effectual, and significantly improves the recovery of eccentric signals with less than $6\%$ of signals missed due to the finite template spacing in the bank.</description>

      <title>Geometric distances between closed universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale structure of the Universe is well approximated by the Friedmann equations, parametrized by several energy densities which can be observationally inferred. A natural question to ask is: How different would the Universe be if these densities took on other values? While there are many ways this can be approached depending on interpretation and mathematical rigor, we attempt an answer by building a "history space" of different cosmologies. A metric is introduced after overcoming technical hurdles related to Lorentzian signature and infinite volume, at least for topologically closed cases. Geodesics connecting two points on the superspace are computed to express how distant--in a purely geometric sense--two universes are. Age can be treated as a free parameter in such an approach, leading to a more general mathematical construct relative to geometrodynamical configuration space. Connections to bubble inflation and phase transitions are explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement the Einsenhart-Duval lift in scalar-tensor gravity as a means to construct integrable cosmological models and analytic cosmological solutions. Specifically, we employ a geometric criterion to constrain the free functions of the scalar-tensor theory such that the field equations can be written in the equivalent form of linear equations. This geometric linearization is achieved by the introduction of an extended minisuperspace description. The results are applied to construct analytic solutions in modified theories of gravity such as the $f\left( R\right) $-theory and the hybrid metric-Palatini $f\left( \mathcal{R}\right) $-gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent arguments based on the quantum extremal surface formula or the gravitational path integral have given fairly compelling evidence that the Hilbert space of quantum gravity in a closed universe is one-dimensional and real. How can this be consistent with the complexity of our own experiences? In this paper we propose that the experiences of any observer $Ob$ in a closed universe can be approximately described by a quantum mechanical theory with a Hilbert space whose dimension is roughly $e^{S_{Ob}}$, where $S_{Ob}$ is the number of degrees of freedom of $Ob$. Moreover we argue that the errors in this description are exponentially small in $S_{Ob}$. We give evidence for this proposal using the gravitational path integral and the coding interpretation of holography, and we explain how similar effects arise in black hole physics in appropriate circumstances.</description>

      <title>Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>Broad primordial power spectrum and $\mu$-distortion constraints on primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) might originate from supermassive primordial black holes (PBHs). However, the hypothesis that these PBHs formed through the enhancement of the primordial curvature perturbations has consistently faced significant challenges due to the stringent constraints imposed by $\mu$-distortion in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Gaussianity on $\mu$-distortion constraint in the context of broad power spectra. Our results show that, under the assumption of non-Gaussian curvature perturbations, a broad power spectrum may lead to weaker $\mu$-distortion constraints compared to the Gaussian cases. Our findings highlight the potential of the broad power spectrum to alleviate the $\mu$-distortion constraints on supermassive PBHs under large non-Gaussianity.</description>
