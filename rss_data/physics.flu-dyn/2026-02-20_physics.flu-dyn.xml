      <title>Ground effect on Undulation and pumping near surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locomotion and fluid pumping near surfaces are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from the slow crawling of snails to the rapid flight of bats. This study categorizes these behaviors based on the Undulation number ($\text{Un}$) and Reynolds number ($Re$). We contrast low $Re$ undulatory propulsion ($\text{Un} &gt; 1$), exemplified by freshwater snails, with high $Re$ flapping propulsion ($\text{Un} &lt; 1$), seen in bats and bees. For snails, we derive lubrication models showing that pumping and swimming speeds scale with $(a/h_0)^2$, a result validated by robotic experiments which also reveal the detrimental effects of surface deformation (high Capillary/Bond ratio). Conversely, for high $Re$ fliers, we examine the ground effect's role in lift enhancement. Biological data from bats (\textit{R. ferrumequinum}) reveal a 2.5-fold increase in lift coefficient during surface-skimming drinking flights, attributed to aerodynamic squeezing effects. Finally, we analyze honeybee fanning, demonstrating how a "jet-vortex" mechanism utilizes ground effect to transport pheromones efficiently against diffusion. These findings provide a unified framework for understanding fluid-structure interactions near boundaries in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of a freely floating droplet in an airstream: effects of temperature, humidity, and shape oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the evaporation dynamics of freely levitated water droplets in an upward airstream under varying temperature and relative humidity conditions, using a custom-designed wind tunnel that replicates natural rainfall scenarios. A high-speed imaging system captures the temporal evolution of morphology, shape oscillations, and size reduction of the droplet undergoing evaporation. Our observations reveal that larger droplets exhibit persistent shape oscillations due to the interplay between inertia and surface tension in the presence of convective airflow, which significantly alters the evaporation rate compared to that of a stationary spherical droplet in quiescent air. To quantify the effects of air convection, complex morphology, and shape oscillations of the levitated droplet at different temperatures and humidity, we develop a modified evaporation model that extends the classical $d^2$-law. This model incorporates (i) a generalized Sherwood number that accounts for the variation in Reynolds number, Schmidt number, temperature, and relative humidity and (ii) a shape factor that captures the time-averaged surface area of oscillating droplets. The model is validated against experimental findings across a wide range of droplet sizes and environmental conditions, showing excellent agreement in predicting the temporal evolution of droplet diameter and total evaporation time. Furthermore, we construct a regime map showing the variation in the lifetime of the droplet in the temperature-humidity space. The present study establishes a framework that integrates convective transport and morphological deformation, offering new insights into the microphysics of raindrop evaporation.</description>

      <title>Fluid viscoelasticity controls acoustic streaming via shear waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of acoustic streaming can significantly impact fluid and particle transport in microfluidics. We report enhancement, suppression, and reversal of acoustic streaming inside a rectangular microchannel by controlling the fluid viscoelastic properties. Our study reveals that the streaming regimes depend on Deborah number ($De$) and viscous diffusion number ($Dv$), expressed in terms of a Streaming Coefficient ($C_s$). We find streaming is enhanced when $C_s&gt;1$, suppressed for $0\leq C_s\leq1$, and reversed when $C_s&lt;0$. We explain the regimes in terms of the interplay between the Reynolds and viscoelastic stresses that collectively drive fluid motion. Remarkably, we discover the role of viscoelastic shear waves in acoustic streaming transition characterized by the ratio of acoustic attenuation length and shear wavelength. We gain deeper insight into the streaming transition by examining energy dynamics in terms of the loss and storage moduli. Our study may find applications in acousto-microfluidics systems for particle handling and fluid pumping/mixing.</description>

      <title>Order of Magnitude Analysis and Data-Based Physics-Informed Symbolic Regression for Turbulent Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction losses in rough pipes are often predicted using semi-empirical correlations, such as the Colebrook-White equation (Colebrook,1939), which do not fully replicate Nikuradse's rough-pipe experiments (1950). This study derives scaling relations for the viscous and turbulent contributions to the streamwise pressure drop through an order-of-magnitude analysis of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the kinetic-energy transport equations. These relations impose constraints on the local sensitivity of the pressure drop to factors such as mean velocity, roughness, viscosity, and density through exponent envelopes and serve as a physical prior for symbolic regression. By combining Nikuradse's rough-pipe and smooth-pipe data of Zagarola and Smits (1998), we aim to derive compact correlations for the friction factor that fit experimental data while adhering to the derived constraints. A modified genetic programming engine (GPTIPS2) optimizes model structure and evaluates it based on fitness, complexity, and constraint violation. This method yields interpretable expressions that accurately reproduce friction factors across various roughness levels and Reynolds numbers, validated up to $Re \sim 10^7$.</description>

      <title>Conversions between kinetic and surface energy in periodically forced multiphase turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiphase flows, kinetic and interfacial energies coexist, and their mutual conversion can strongly influence the overall energy balance. However, in statistically steady flows these energy reservoirs remain constant, making such conversions undetectable. For them to be observed, a degree of unsteadiness must be introduced, here provided by the deliberate use of a fluctuating time-periodic input of kinetic energy into the system. The main focus of the present work is on the dynamical cycle connecting energy injection, conversion, and dissipation which we explore using numerical simulations of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence, subjected to periodic forcing. The database includes various Reynolds and Weber numbers and volume fractions in the dense regime. To interpret and replicate the observed dynamics, we reformulate the \textit{Ka-Pi-bara} model of \cite{Bos2026} (an extension of the $k$--$\epsilon$ model) in terms of total energy (the sum of kinetic and surface energy), which we further enhance by adding equations for the surface energy and its destruction. This model accurately captures a key feature of turbulence: non-equilibrium effects, seen as the phase lag between kinetic energy and its rate of dissipation, which are found to operate also in multiphase flows. Linearizing the model highlights the various relevant time scales of the system and provides predictions of how different observables are coupled and respond to the energy input. In particular, the model predicts that fluctuations of surface energy and its destruction are in phase, in good agreement with numerical simulations. Therefore, unlike kinetic energy, surface energy remains in equilibrium, indicating the absence of a surface energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Penetration of impact-induced jets into skin-simulating materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares the penetration characteristics of impact-induced jets with those of laser-induced jets, focusing on the underlying penetration mechanism rather than device performance for needle-free injection. Using an impact-induced jet system capable of ejecting a highly focused liquid jet at high speed without the use of lasers, we examine jet penetration into skin-simulating materials. Unlike conventional needle-free injectors that produce diffused liquid jets, the impact-induced method generates a highly focused jet that limits the injected area, thereby reducing invasiveness. Comparative experiments with laser-induced jets show that, even at similar jet tip velocities, impact-induced jets achieve greater penetration depth. The penetration depth remains constant regardless of the offset distance D from the target, owing to the high and nearly uniform velocity of the cylindrical jet root region, indicating that penetration is governed by the cylindrical jet structure. Furthermore, we systematically vary the liquid viscosity, jet inertia, and elastic modulus of the skin-simulating material. To account for cylindrical liquid jet penetration, a shear deformation model is proposed, in which the jet kinetic energy is dissipated through deformation of the gelatin. The model shows good agreement with experimental results and provides a unified physical basis for liquid jet penetration.</description>

      <title>Wavy-wall-based flow control for the suction side geometry of NACA4412 at Retau = 3000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a high Reynolds number experimental study of turbulent boundary layer separation control on a convex plate using the wavy-wall method, which was initially proposed for a flat plate by Dr\'o\.zd\.z et al. 2021 (Exp Therm Fluid Sci 2021;121:110291). The application of this method increases the friction coefficient by up to 42.3%, resulting in a substantial delay in turbulent separation from the convex wall, while maintaining total momentum, quantified by changes in momentum-loss thickness. Other parameters indicating the high efficiency of the method are the invariant value of the friction Reynolds number along the flow and the thinner boundary layer. The above indicators demonstrate promising aerodynamic improvements in airfoils, similar to those achieved when active suction is applied to the suction side. The new insight into the physical mechanism of the wavy wall suggests that small-scale turbulent activity is the primary determinant of the effectiveness of the wavy wall in enhancing small-scale streamwise convection and the sweeping motion, resulting in superior momentum transport. However, when the wavy wall, due to poorly selected geometry, induces large-scale motions, such as separation in the trough, it counteracts the mechanism. Then this geometry has a detrimental effect on the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Controlled dripping from a grooved condensing plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed water on vertical surfaces ultimately leaves the substrate at the lower edge, where accumulated liquid detaches as drops. While droplet growth and surface transport have been extensively studied, this final release step remains poorly understood and largely uncontrolled. Yet this boundary event determines how and when condensed water is removed. We ask whether geometry can replace randomness as the governing mechanism of edge dripping. By engraving vertical grooves upstream, we redirect water from surface flow into groove-guided drainage toward the boundary. This switch in transport mode changes how liquid accumulates and detaches at the edge. Using rapid forced condensation and high-resolution imaging, we systematically vary groove spacing s, aspect ratio d/w, and orientation. We then analyse how these geometric parameters influence the formation, stability, and spatial organization of droplets hanging below the edge. Smooth substrates exhibit irregular, impact-driven detachment. Grooved substrates produce localized and steady dripping points. When grooves converge, dripping occurs at fixed, geometry-defined locations. For convergent designs, a simple condensation-capillarity model captures the dependence of the dripping period on the area of the drainage basin. Together, these results demonstrate that geometry alone can transform stochastic edge dripping into spatially organized and temporally regular release, with implications for dew harvesting, passive cooling, and millifluidic transport.</description>

      <title>Reverse segregation in dense granular flow through narrow vertical channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling flow-induced segregation in a granular mixture is highly relevant to many industrial settings. To enhance mixing or promote segregation, the continuous gravity flow of a bidisperse granular mixture through a series of narrow vertical channels with exit slots is investigated. The bidisperse mixture is composed of two different sizes of particles, but of the same density. In dense flow, segregation occurs, leading to formation of bands. The bands of large particles appear at a distance away from the walls. This finding is in contrast to that in shear-driven segregation in a dense flow where large particles segregate towards the walls. Using a phenomenological model, it has been shown that rolling and bouncing induced segregation is the dominant mechanism. When cylindrical inserts are placed to modify flow patterns, that significantly influences segregation patterns. The symmetrical placement of a cylindrical insert close to the exit slot vanishes the bands and enhances mixing. However, with two inserts placed symmetrically and close to the exit slot, the degree of segregation in the reverse direction is greatly enhanced compared to that without insert. In the former, small particles accumulate in thin regions adjacent to the walls, and large particles comprise the bulk of the domain and the flowing stream. The heap formation above the insert in a narrow channel, when the insert is close to the exit, enhances mixing in one configuration, whereas it amplifies reverse segregation in the other.</description>

      <title>Particle Thermal Inertia Delays the Onset of Convection in Particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the linear stability of a thermally stratified fluid layer confined between horizontal walls and subject to continuous injection of dilute thermal particles at one boundary and extraction at the opposite, forming a particulate Rayleigh-B\'enard (pRB) system. The analysis focuses on the influence of thermal coupling between the dispersed and carrier phases, quantified by the specific heat capacity ratio $\epsilon$. Increasing $\epsilon$ systematically enhances stability, with this effect persisting across a wide range of conditions, including heavy and light particles, variations in volumetric flux, injection velocity and direction, and injection temperature. The stabilizing influence saturates when the volumetric heat capacity of the particles approaches that of the fluid, $\epsilon = O(1)$. The physical mechanism is attributed to a modification of the base-state temperature profile caused by interphase heat exchange, which reduces thermal gradients near the injection wall and weakens buoyancy-driven motion.</description>

      <title>Droplet Breakup Against an Isolated Obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk &lt;&lt; 1) to always breaking for Bk &gt;&gt; 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric cavities in hypersonic flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed experimental campaign is conducted to investigate the shear layer characteristics of an axisymmetric open cavity exposed to a Mach $6$ freestream. Experiments are performed in a Ludwieg tunnel for varying Reynolds numbers ($23000\leq Re_D \leq 74000$) based on cavity depth ($D$). The effects of geometry are examined through length-to-depth ratios ($[L/D]=[2,4,6]$) and non-dimensional rear-face height differences ($[\Delta h/D]=[-0.5,-0.25,0,0.25,0.5]$). Shear layer evolution is interpreted using qualitative schlieren and Planar Laser Rayleigh Scattering (PLRS) along with quantitative unsteady pressure measurements. For all $[L/D]$, the shear layer remains laminar at low $Re_D$ and develops Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) vortices as $Re_D$ increases. For the longest cavity ($[L/D]=6$), transition to turbulence occurs at the highest $Re_D$ due to a longer K-H growth length. Spectral analysis of pressure signals and PLRS intensity shows a shift in dominant frequency from the first Rossiter mode to higher modes for $[L/D]=6$. Except for $[L/D]=6, [\Delta h/D]=0$, dominant frequencies agree with Rossiter predictions and remain largely Reynolds-number independent. Variation of $[\Delta h/D]$ leads to mode switching identified using POD of PLRS snapshots. Negative $[\Delta h/D]$ favors K-H modes (5th-6th Rossiter), whereas positive values promote a strong flapping mode (1st Rossiter) due to pressure build-up inside the cavity. At $[\Delta h/D]=0$, both modes may coexist depending on $Re_D$. Azimuthal measurements indicate dominant axisymmetric behavior in flapping cases and weaker correlation for K-H dominated shear layers.</description>

      <title>Large traveling capillary-gravity waves for Darcy flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study capillary-gravity surface waves for fluid flows governed by Darcy's law. This includes flows in vertical Hele-Shaw cells and in porous media (the one-phase Muskat problem) with finite or infinite depth. The free boundary is acted upon by an external pressure posited to be in traveling wave form with an arbitrary periodic profile and an amplitude parameter. For any given wave speed, we first prove that there exists a unique local curve of small periodic traveling waves corresponding to small values of the parameter. Then we prove that as the parameter increases but could possibly be bounded, the curve belongs to a connected set $\mathcal{C}$ of traveling waves. The set $\mathcal{C}$ contains traveling waves that either have arbitrarily large gradients or are arbitrarily close to the rigid bottom in the finite depth case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of large traveling surface waves for a viscous free boundary problem.</description>

      <title>Transverse Instability of Stokes Waves at Finite Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Stokes wave is a traveling free-surface periodic water wave that is constant in the direction transverse to the direction of propagation. In 1981 McLean discovered via numerical methods that Stokes waves are unstable with respect to transverse perturbations. In \cite{CreNguStr} for the case of infinite depth we proved rigorously that the spectrum of the water wave system linearized at small Stokes waves, with respect to transverse perturbations, contains unstable eigenvalues lying approximately on an ellipse. In this paper we consider the case of finite depth and prove that the same spectral instability result holds for all but finitely many values of the depth. The computations and some aspects of the theory are considerably more complicated in the finite depth case.</description>
