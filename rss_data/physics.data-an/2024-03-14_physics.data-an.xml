      <title>Guidelines for the Creation of Analysis Ready Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globally, there is an increased need for guidelines to produce high-quality data outputs for analysis. There is no framework currently exists providing guidelines for a comprehensive approach in producing analysis ready data (ARD). Through critically reviewing and summarising current literature, this paper proposes such guidelines for the creation of ARD. The guidelines proposed in this paper inform ten steps in the generation of ARD: ethics, project documentation, data governance, data management, data storage, data discovery and collection, data cleaning, quality assurance, metadata, and data dictionary. These steps are illustrated through a substantive case study which aimed to create ARD for a digital spatial platform: the Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas (ACYWA).</description>

      <title>Criticality in an imidazolium ionic liquid fully wetting a sapphire support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Ionic liquids have various applications in catalytic reaction environments. In those systems, their interaction with interfaces is key to their performance as a liquid phase. We hypothesize that the way a monolayer ionic liquid phase interacts with interfaces like a sapphire substrate is significantly dependent on temperature and that critical behavior can be observed in the structural properties of the liquid film.
  Methods and simulations: We perform molecular dynamics simulations of imidazolium-based ionic liquid monolayers deposited on a sapphire substrate at temperatures from 200K to 400K. We develop computational tools to analyze structural properties of molecular arrangement in the monolayer, the structure of the film and the defects spontaneously forming and healing.
  Findings: We observe a clear structural phase transition at around 300K from a solid-like to a liquid-like behavior of a film. Below the critical point an alternating crystalline structure of cations and anions with alignment of periodic vectors with the underlying substrate grid is observed, with frozen defects. Above the critical temperature, the pattern becomes isotropic within the contact layer that displays dynamic defects of a characteristic size. Our results highlight the importance of confinement to the phase behavior of the system.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty components in profile likelihood fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a measurement of a physical quantity is reported, the total uncertainty is usually decomposed into statistical and systematic uncertainties. This decomposition is not only useful to understand the contributions to the total uncertainty, but also required to propagate these contributions in subsequent analyses, such as combinations or interpretation fits including results from other measurements or experiments. In profile-likelihood fits, widely applied in high-energy physics analyses, contributions of systematic uncertainties are routinely quantified using ``impacts'', which are not adequate for such applications. We discuss the difference between impacts and actual uncertainty components, and establish methods to determine the latter in a wide range of statistical models.</description>

      <title>Process signature-driven high spatio-temporal resolution alignment of multimodal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present HiRA-Pro, a novel procedure to align, at high spatio-temporal resolutions, multimodal signals from real-world processes and systems that exhibit diverse transient, nonlinear stochastic dynamics, such as manufacturing machines. It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Suspended accounts align with the Internet Research Agency misinformation campaign to influence the 2016 US election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ongoing debate surrounding the impact of the Internet Research Agency s (IRA) social media campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential election has largely overshadowed the involvement of other actors. Our analysis brings to light a substantial group of suspended Twitter users, outnumbering the IRA user group by a factor of 60, who align with the ideologies of the IRA campaign. Our study demonstrates that this group of suspended Twitter accounts significantly influenced individuals categorized as undecided or weak supporters, potentially with the aim of swaying their opinions, as indicated by Granger causality.</description>

      <title>Unifying Lyapunov exponents with probabilistic uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lyapunov exponent is well-known in deterministic dynamical systems as a measure for quantifying chaos and detecting coherent regions in physically evolving systems. In this Letter, we show how the Lyapunov exponent can be unified with stochastic sensitivity (which quantifies the uncertainty of an evolving uncertain system whose initial condition is certain) within a finite time uncertainty quantification framework in which both the dynamics and the initial condition of a continuously evolving $ n $-dimensional state variable are uncertain.</description>
