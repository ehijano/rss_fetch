      <title>Generalisation of the Total Linearisation Method to Three-dimensional Free-Surface Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An iterative Finite Element method predicated on a linearisation of the weak form around a reference configuration is derived for general, three-dimensional, free-surface flows, including systems with moving contact lines. The method is a rigorous generalisation of the Total Linearisation Method that was proposed by Kruyt et al. (1988) for two-dimensional flows with contact angles limited to $90^\circ$. In contrast to existing numerical methods for free-surface-flow problems, the present linearisation produces a weak form that is devoid of displacement degrees of freedom in the bulk, thus nearly halving the size of the linear system when compared to standard linearised methods. A novel preconditioner, whose implementation is made possible by the size reduction, is employed to solve the large resulting monolithic Jacobian systems with the Generalised Minimum Residual Method. The proposed method and the preconditioner are shown to be effective on two numerical examples of capillary flows, namely (i) the cylindrical die swell problem, solved both in 3D Cartesian coordinates and under the Ansatz of axisymmetry; and (ii) an enclosed 2D thermo-capillary problem. For the die swell, numerical results are validated by existing experimental results and prior simulations, and confirm both the extension to 3D and theoretical convergence rates. For the thermo-capillary problem, simulations verify earlier calculations. Additional simulations are also carried out for a new range of contact angles made possible by the extension.</description>

      <title>Laboratory observation of internal gravity wave turbulence in a three-dimensional, large-scale facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for solutions to the theory of weakly non-linear internal gravity wave turbulence is an active research topic. It is notably stimulated by the fact that this regime could drive fine-scale ocean dynamics for which the identification of a physical model could yield improved parametrizations in global oceanic models. In this context, analytical works lead to diverse predictions and the experimental observation of a regime of developed weakly-non-linear internal wave turbulence constitutes a major, still unachieved, objective of experimentalists in the field. In this study, building on recent experimental developments, we present laboratory observations of internal gravity wave turbulence in a linearly stratified fluid, performed in a large-scale, three-dimensional facility allowing the forcing of long-wavelength internal waves. Our setup allows to access large Reynolds numbers favoring the development of turbulent power-law spectra while keeping the Froude number relatively low in order to remain weakly non-linear. As the forcing amplitude increases, the flow seems to approach a wave turbulence regime: we indeed observe the progressive construction of a continuous distribution of energy both in the frequency and wave number spaces, whereas the spatio-temporal spectra indicate that the energy remains almost exclusively carried by internal gravity waves verifying the dispersion relation. We finally show that, as the transition to turbulence proceeds, the bicoherence spectrum of the velocity field becomes smooth over the internal wave frequency domain, taking values of the order of the Froude number. While these observations are in line with the phenomenology of weakly non-linear wave turbulence, the power laws in $k^{-3}$ we report over about a decade for the horizontal and vertical spatial energy spectra agree with the prediction that can be made from raw [...]</description>

      <title>First observation of the Josephson-Anderson relation in experiments on hydrodynamic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify a recent prediction (Eq. 3.50 in G. L. Eyink, Phys. Rev. X 11, 031054 (2021)) for the drag on an object moving through a fluid. In this prediction the velocity field is decomposed into a nonvortical (potential) and vortical contribution, and so is the associated drag force. In the Josephson-Anderson relation the vortical contribution of the drag force follows from the flux of vorticity traversing the streamlines of the corresponding potential flow. The potential component is directly determined by the plate acceleration and its added mass. The Josephson-Anderson relation is derived from the quantum description of superfluids, but remarkably applies to the classical fluid in our experiment. In our experiment a flat plate is accelerated through water using a robotic arm. This geometry is simple enough to allow analytic potential flow streamlines. The monitored plate position shows an oscillatory component of the acceleration, which adds an additional test of the Josephson-Anderson relation. The instantaneous velocity field is measured using particle image velocimetry. It enables us to evaluate Eq. 3.50 from [1] and compare its prediction to the measured drag force. We find excellent agreement, and, most remarkably find that the added mass contribution to the drag force still stands out after the flow has turned vortical. We finally comment on the requirements on the experimental techniques for evaluating the Josephson-Anderson relation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-steady aerodynamics predicts the dynamics of flapping locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propulsion of a flapping wing or foil is emblematic of bird flight and fish swimming. Previous studies have identified hallmarks of the propulsive dynamics that have been attributed to unsteady effects such as the formation and shedding of edge vortices and wing-vortex interactions. Here we show that the key behaviors of heaving flight are captured by a quasi-steady aerodynamic model that predicts forces from motions without needing to solve for the flows. We address the forward dynamics induced by up-and-down heaving motions of a thin plate with a nonlinear model which involves lift and drag forces that vary with speed and attack angle. Simulations reproduce the well-known transition for increasing Reynolds number from a stationary state to a propulsive state, where the latter is characterized by a Strouhal number that is conserved across broad ranges of parameters. Parametric, sensitivity, and stability analyses provide physical interpretations for these results and show the importance of accounting for the flow regimes which are demarcated by Reynolds number and angle of attack. These findings extend the phenomena of unsteady locomotion that can be explained by quasi-steady modeling, and they broaden the conditions and parameter ranges over which such models are applicable.</description>

      <title>Source locations and convection velocities of outer-scaled wall-pressure fluctuations in canonical turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study identifies that the large-scale ($\delta$-scaled) sources of wall-pressure fluctuations ($p_w$) beneath a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer extend from the near-wall region up to the top of the logarithmic region (approximately 0.15$\delta$, where $\delta$ is the boundary layer thickness). Even though contributions from the wake region are present, they are found to be statistically less dominant than those from the logarithmic region. The findings are based on bespoke measurements using an array of 63 microphones spanning 5$\delta$ in the streamwise direction, which synchronously captures space-time $p_w$ data alongside streamwise velocity fluctuations ($u$) from a single hotwire probe at the array's downstream end. The array is designed to spatially filter $p_w$ signals to uncover outer-scale contributions, by accurately resolving the large-scale portion of the frequency-wavenumber $p_w$ spectrum while avoiding aliasing from small-scale energy. This design is validated against previously published low-Reynolds-number simulation datasets of turbulent boundary layer flow. Present experiments span a friction Reynolds number range of $1400 \lesssim Re_{\tau} \lesssim 5200$, over which the large-scale energy in the boundary layer grows significantly. This growth is reflected in both the frequency-wavenumber $p_w$ spectrum and the space-time $p_w$ correlations, both of which show scaling trends reflective of the large-scale pressure field convecting at an outer-scaled velocity of $0.75U_\infty$, where $U_\infty$ is the freestream velocity. The Reynolds-number-dependent amplification of large-scale $p_w$ sources is directly quantified through reconstructed space-time $p_w$--$u$ correlations, which show increasing magnitudes across the inner region with rising $Re_{\tau}$.</description>

      <title>Preferential sampling enabled by particle finite size and anisotropic shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic, finite-sized particles, common in environmental and industrial flows, exhibit complex dynamics distinct from those of small, spherical particles. Their shape introduces orientation-dependent forces, and their finite size affects how they experience the flow field. While the effects of particle inertia are known to cause preferential sampling, in this study we consider whether preferential sampling can arise due to finite size and shape alone by considering inertialess rods using slender-body theory. First, we show analytically that preferential sampling can only occur in this limit given the presence of three ingredients: finite particle size, anisotropic particle shape, and a nonlinear flow field. Next, to demonstrate this effect, we simulate rods in a steady 2D cellular flow: the Taylor-Green vortex flow. By analyzing the rod trajectories, we find that rods do indeed preferentially sample areas of both high and low vorticity, corresponding to the fixed points of the flow: the high vorticity cell centers and the low vorticity saddle points in the corners of each cell. This preferential sampling increases with increasing rod length. We also analyze the same data with respect to the flow's nonlinearity (i.e. curvature) to find that the rods preferentially sample the linear regions of the flow and undersample the nonlinear regions. Finally, we analyze the nonlinear dynamics of this system, showing that chaotic trajectories appear as the rod length increases, and that these chaotic regions in the flow also tend to overlap with higher flow nonlinearity. Overall, we show how finite size and anisotropic shape alone can cause particles to preferentially sample a flow field, and that this preferential sampling is highly linked to the flow's nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Physics-based modelling of turbulence in wind-turbine wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So-called engineering or analytical wind farm flow solvers typically build upon two submodels: one for the velocity deficit and one for the wake-added turbulence intensity. While velocity deficit modelling has received considerable attention, wake-added turbulence models are less prevalent in comparison. Yet, accurate estimates of local turbulence intensity are essential for predicting flow interactions and energy yield, as turbine wakes are both sensitive to and sources of turbulence. Existing wake-added turbulence models are typically empirical or assume axial symmetry despite the inherently three-dimensional nature of turbulent wake fields. In this work, we present a physics-based model for wake-added turbulence intensity. Our approach is based on the analysis of the turbulent kinetic energy and the streamwise Reynolds stress budget, incorporating classical RANS modelling assumptions and far-wake approximations. The resulting model maintains a simple and practical form, demonstrating strong agreement with LES and wind tunnel measurements. Our model provides a more physically consistent and predictive tool for wind farm flow modelling and performance estimation.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of high-order compact and second-order gas-kinetic schemes in compressible flow simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trade-off among accuracy, robustness, and computational cost remains a key challenge in simulating complex flows. Second-order schemes are computationally efficient but lack the accuracy required for resolving intricate flow structures, particularly in turbulence. High-order schemes, especially compact high-order schemes, offer superior accuracy and resolution at a relatively modest computational cost. To clarify the practical performance of high-order schemes in scale-resolving simulations, this study evaluates two representative gas-kinetic schemes: the newly developed fifth-order compact gas-kinetic scheme (CGKS-5th) and the conventional second-order gas-kinetic scheme (GKS-2nd). Test cases ranging from subsonic to supersonic flows are used to quantitatively assess their accuracy and efficiency. The results demonstrate that CGKS-5th achieves comparable resolution to GKS-2nd at roughly an order of magnitude lower computational cost. Under equivalent computational resources, CGKS-5th delivers significantly higher accuracy and resolution, particularly in turbulent flows involving shocks and small-scale vortices. This study provides the first clear verification of the advantages of high-order compact gas-kinetic schemes in simulating viscous flows with discontinuities. Additionally, multi-GPU parallelization using CUDA and MPI is implemented to enable large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity and growth of non-linear magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability -- Role of the magnetic field strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-linear regime of the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) has been studied in the context of several laboratory and astrophysical systems. Yet, several fundamental aspects remain unclear. One of them is the self-similar evolution of the instability. Studies have assumed that non-linear MRTI has a self-similar, quadratic growth similar to hydrodynamic (HD) RTI. However, neither self-similarity nor quadratic growth has been proved analytically. Furthermore, an explicit understanding of the factors that control the growth of non-linear instability remains unclear. Magnetic fields are known to play a crucial role in the evolution of the instability. Yet, a systematic study discussing how the magnetic field influences the instability growth is missing. These issues were addressed by performing an analytical and numerical study of the MRTI with a uniform magnetic field. Our study reveals that the imposed magnetic field does not conform to the HD self-similar evolution. However, the influence of the imposed magnetic field decays with time (t) as 1/t relative to the other non-linear terms, making the MRTI conform to the HD self-similarity. Thus, the HD RTI self-similar scaling becomes relevant to MRTI at late times, when nonlinear dynamics dominate. Based on energy conservation, an equation for the mixing layer height (h) is derived, which demonstrates the quadratic growth of h in time. This gave insight into various factors that could influence the non-linear growth of the instability. By studying MRTI at different magnetic field strengths, we demonstrate the role of magnetic field strength on the nonlinear growth of MRTI. Thus, the current study analytically and numerically proves the role of magnetic fields on the evolution of MRTI.</description>

      <title>Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition of rapid snapshot pairs sampled at sub-Nyquist intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modal decomposition methods are important for characterizing the low-dimensional dynamics of complex systems, including turbulent flows. Different methods have varying data requirements and produce modes with different properties. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) produces orthogonal, energy-ranked spatial modes at discrete temporal frequencies for statistically stationary flows. However, SPOD requires long stretches of sequential, uniformly sampled, time-resolved data. These data requirements limit SPOD's use in experimental settings where the maximum capture rate of a camera is often slower than the Nyquist sampling rate required to resolve the highest turbulent frequencies. However, if two PIV systems operate in tandem, pairs of data can be acquired that are arbitrarily close in time. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) uses this pairwise data to resolve frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency associated with the small time step within a pair. However, these modes do not form a basis and have no set ranking. The present work attempts to compute SPOD modes from pairwise data with a small time step but with large gaps between pairs. We use DMD on pairwise data to estimate segment-wise, uniformly sampled series that can then be used to estimate the SPOD modes, intending to resolve frequencies between the gap and pair Nyquist limits. The method is tested on numerically obtained data of the linearized complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, as well as a Mach 0.4 isothermal turbulent jet. For the jet, pairwise SPOD can accurately de-alias the SPOD spectrum and estimate mode shapes at frequencies up to St = 1.0, while using over 90% less data.</description>

      <title>Experimental identification of blade-level forces, torque, and pitching moment for cross-flow turbines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-flow turbine power is a net sum of power generation from rotating blades and power loss from rotating support structures. While the aggregate forces and torques at the turbine level are important for end use, these can inhibit a deeper understanding of fluid-structure interactions. Identification of blade-level forces and torques allows for specific investigations into how the fluid forcing on the blade drives rotation and can aid blade structural design. Here, we present a physics-based methodology for extracting blade-level forces and torques from experimental measurements at the axis of rotation of a cross-flow turbine, and demonstrate strong agreement with equivalent blade-only simulations. In doing so, we highlight the often-overlooked pitching moment, which offsets continuous increases in power generation from the tangential force and leads to net-zero power generation at freewheel.</description>

      <title>Inferring activity from the flow field around active colloidal particles using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active colloidal particles create flow around them due to non-equilibrium process on their surfaces. In this paper, we infer the activity of such colloidal particles from the flow field created by them via deep learning. We first explain our method for one active particle, inferring the $2s$ mode (or the stresslet) and the $3t$ mode (or the source dipole) from the flow field data, along with the position and orientation of the particle. We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.</description>
