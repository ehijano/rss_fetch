      <title>Physics-informed motion registration of lung parenchyma across static CT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung injuries, such as ventilator-induced lung injury and radiation-induced lung injury, can lead to heterogeneous alterations in the biomechanical behavior of the lungs. While imaging methods, e.g., X-ray and static computed tomography (CT), can point to regional alterations in lung structure between healthy and diseased tissue, they fall short of delineating timewise kinematic variations between the former and the latter. Image registration has gained recent interest as a tool to estimate the displacement experienced by the lungs during respiration via regional deformation metrics such as volumetric expansion and distortion. However, successful image registration commonly relies on a temporal series of image stacks with small displacements in the lungs across succeeding image stacks, which remains limited in static imaging. In this study, we have presented a finite element (FE) method to estimate strains from static images acquired at the end-expiration (EE) and end-inspiration (EI) timepoints, i.e., images with a large deformation between the two distant timepoints. Physiologically realistic loads were applied to the geometry obtained at EE to deform this geometry to match the geometry obtained at EI. The results indicated that the simulation could minimize the error between the two geometries. Using four-dimensional (4D) dynamic CT in a rat, the strain at an isolated transverse plane estimated by our method showed sufficient agreement with that estimated through non-rigid image registration that used all the timepoints. Through the proposed method, we can estimate the lung deformation at any timepoint between EE and EI. The proposed method offers a tool to estimate timewise regional deformation in the lungs using only static images acquired at EE and EI.</description>

      <title>An analytic, moment-based method to estimate orthopositronium lifetimes in positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of tumor hypoxia is known to correlate with poor patient prognosis. Measurement of tissue oxygen concentration can be challenging, but recent advancements using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) in three-dimensional positron emission tomography (PET) scans have shown promise for hypoxia detection. In this work, a novel method for estimating the orthopositronium lifetime in PALS is presented. This method is analytical and uses moments of the time-difference histogram from photon arrival times. For sufficient statistical power, the method produces monotonic, stable estimates. For cases with a lower number of photon counts, the method was characterized and solutions are presented to correct for bias and estimation variability.</description>

      <title>JulianA.jl -- A Julia package for radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of computers is continually increasing in radiotherapy. Efficient algorithms, implementations and the ability to leverage advancements in computer science are crucial to improve cancer care even further and deliver the best treatment to each patient. Yet, the software landscape for radiotherapy is fragmented into proprietary systems that do not share a common interface. Further, the radiotherapy community does not have access to the vast possibilities offered by modern programming languages and their ecosystem of libraries yet.
  We present JulianA.jl, a novel Julia package for radiotherapy. It aims to provide a modular and flexible foundation for the development and efficient implementation of algorithms and workflows for radiotherapy researchers and clinicians. JulianA.jl can be interfaced with any scriptable treatment planning system, be it commercial, open source or in-house developed. This article highlights our design choices and showcases the package's simplicity and powerful automatic treatment planning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Color-map recommendation for MR relaxometry maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To harmonize the use of color for MR relaxometry maps and therefore recommend the use of specific color-maps for representing T1 and T2 maps. Methods: Perceptually linearized color-maps were chosen to have similar color settings as those proposed by Griswold et al. in 2018. A Delphi process, polling the opinion of a panel of 81 experts, was used to generate consensus on the suitability of these maps. Results: Consensus was reached on the suitability of the logarithm-processed Lipari color-map for T1 and the logarithm-processed Navia color-map for T2. There was consensus on color bars being mandatory and on the use of a specific value indicating invalidity. There was no consensus on whether the ranges should be fixed per anatomy. Conclusion: The authors recommend the use of the logarithm-processed Lipari color map for displaying quantitative T1 maps and R1 maps; likewise, the authors recommend the logarithm-processed Navia color-map for displaying T2, T2*, R2 and R2* maps.</description>

      <title>Multiomics-based Outcome Prediction for the Treatment of Brain Metastases with Personalized Ultra-fractionated Stereotactic Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We aimed to develop a data-driven multiomics approach integrating radiomics, dosiomics, and delta features to predict treatment response at an earlier stage (intra-treatment) for brain metastases (BMs) patients treated with PULSAR. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 39 patients with 69 BMs treated with PULSAR. Radiomics, dosiomics, and delta features were extracted from pretreatment and intra-treatment MRI scans and dose distributions. Six individual models and an ensemble feature selection (EFS) model were constructed using SVM and evaluated via stratified 5-fold cross-validation. The classification task distinguished lesions with &gt;20% volume reduction at follow-up. We assessed performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, and AUC. Various feature extraction and ensemble selection scenarios were explored to enhance model robustness and reduce overfitting. Results: The EFS model, integrating features from pre-treatment radiomics and dosiomics, intra-treatment radiomics, and delta-radiomics, outperformed six individual models. It achieved an AUC of 0.979, accuracy of 0.917, and F1 score of 0.821. Among the top 9 features, six were derived from post-wavelet transformation, and three from original images. The discrete wavelet transform decomposes volumetric images into multi-resolution components, offering a more comprehensive characterization of underlying structures. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of employing a data-driven multiomics approach to predict tumor volume changes in BMs patients with PULSAR. The EFS model demonstrates enhanced performance compared with six individual models, emphasizing the importance of integrating both pretreatment and intra-treatment data. This application holds promise for optimizing BMs management, potentially mitigating risks associated with under- or over-treatment.</description>

      <title>A Novel Portable and Wearable Broadband Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Device for In-Vivo Oxygenation and Metabolism Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband NIRS (bNIRS) is an extension of fNIRS that provides the same assessment of oxygenation biomarkers along with a valuable marker for oxygen metabolism at a cellular level, the oxidation state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO). bNIRS implements many (100s) NIR wavelengths in the full NIR spectrum to address this and provide insight to tissue energetics. To supply these many wavelengths of light, broadband sources are required, and spectrometers are employed to distinguish power per wavelength. Current multi-channel bNIRS instruments are bulky and only semi-portable due to technological limitations. We propose a design for a bNIRS device that has been miniaturized to allow for portable use. This design leverages the innovations in photonic devices that have created a new line of microspectrometers and broadband NIR high-power LEDs; the Hamamatsu SMD-type spectrometer C14384MA and the Ushio SMBBIR45-1100 LED. This first-of-itskind device, referred to as microCYRIL (after its two predecessors CYRIL and miniCYRIL), has been developed for oxygenation and metabolism measurements with dual channel operation. To verify functionality, concentration changes in oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin and oxCCO were successfully tracked during a cuff-induced venous and arterial occlusion.</description>

      <title>A network aggregation model for the dynamics and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases at the brain scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the assembly of specific proteins into oligomers and fibrillar aggregates. At the brain scale, these protein assemblies can diffuse through the brain and seed other regions, creating an autocatalytic protein progression. The growth and transport of these assemblies depend on various mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. Here, we use spatially-extended nucleation-aggregation-fragmentation models for the dynamics of prion-like neurodegenerative protein-spreading in the brain to study the effect of different drugs on whole-brain Alzheimer's disease progression.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis of FLASH Effect Models Based on Theoretical Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clinical applications of FLASH radiotherapy require formulas to describe how the FLASH radiation features and other related factors determine the FLASH effect. Mathematical analysis of the models can connect the theoretical hypotheses with the radiobiological effect, which provides the foundation for establishing clinical application models. We abstract the complex models of the oxygen depletion hypothesis and radical recombination-antioxidants hypothesis into concise mathematical equations. The equations are solved to analyze how the radiation features and other factors influence the FLASH effect. Then we propose methodologies for determining the parameters in the models and utilizing the models to predict the FLASH effect.The formulas linking the physical, chemical and biological factors to the FLASH effect are obtained through mathematical derivation of the equation. The analysis indicates that the initial oxygen concentration, radiolytic oxygen consumption and oxygen recovery are key factors for the oxygen depletion hypothesis and that the level of antioxidants is the key factor for the radical recombination-antioxidants hypothesis. According to the model derivations and analysis, the methodologies for determining parameters and predicting the FLASH effect are proposed: the criteria for data filtration, the strategy of hybrid FLASH and conventional dose rate irradiation to ensure the acquisition of effective experimental data across a wide dose range, the pipelines of fitting parameters and predicting the FLASH effect. The derived formulas can be used to calculate the FLASH effect in future clinical FLASH radiotherapy. The proposed methodologies guide to obtain sufficient high-quality datasets and utilize them to predict the FLASH effect. Furthermore, this study indicates the key factors of the FLASH effect and offers clues to further explore the FLASH mechanism.</description>

      <title>Explicit Abnormality Extraction for Unsupervised Motion Artifact Reduction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01732v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion artifacts compromise the quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pose challenges to achieving diagnostic outcomes and image-guided therapies. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches have emerged as successful solutions for motion artifact reduction (MAR). One disadvantage of these methods is their dependency on acquiring paired sets of motion artifact-corrupted (MA-corrupted) and motion artifact-free (MA-free) MR images for training purposes. Obtaining such image pairs is difficult and therefore limits the application of supervised training. In this paper, we propose a novel UNsupervised Abnormality Extraction Network (UNAEN) to alleviate this problem. Our network is capable of working with unpaired MA-corrupted and MA-free images. It converts the MA-corrupted images to MA-reduced images by extracting abnormalities from the MA-corrupted images using a proposed artifact extractor, which intercepts the residual artifact maps from the MA-corrupted MR images explicitly, and a reconstructor to restore the original input from the MA-reduced images. The performance of UNAEN was assessed by experimenting with various publicly available MRI datasets and comparing them with state-of-the-art methods. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates the superiority of UNAEN over alternative MAR methods and visually exhibits fewer residual artifacts. Our results substantiate the potential of UNAEN as a promising solution applicable in real-world clinical environments, with the capability to enhance diagnostic accuracy and facilitate image-guided therapies. Our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/YuSheng-Zhou/UNAEN.</description>
