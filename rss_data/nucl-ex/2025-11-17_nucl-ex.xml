      <title>New Ground State in ${}^{149}$La: Lanthanum Isotopes Lose Their Distinctive Feature in Two-Neutron Separation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear mass is a key indicator of how the nuclear shell structure evolves. The recent mass measurement study of neutron-rich lanthanum isotopes [A. Jaries, $et~al$., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 042501(2025)] reveals the presence of a distinct prominence in their two-neutron separation energies. However, its presence has been called into question based on the results of another study [B. Liu, Ph.D. thesis, University of Notre Dame (2025)]. In this letter, we report an effort to clarify these contradictory results through the use of the simultaneous mass-lifetime measurement of the neutron-rich lanthanum isotope ${}^{149}$La using a multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrograph combined with a $\beta$-TOF detector. The peak corresponding to a $\beta$-decaying state was observed in the time-of-flight spectra at a position of $221(6)~{\rm keV/c^2}$ lighter than the reported ${}^{149}$La mass. We have concluded that this peak is the ground state of ${}^{149}$La. With this, the previously reported distinct prominence in the two-neutron separation energies disappears, while a new kink structure, similar to that in the cerium isotopes, appears. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a nuclear shape transition from octupole deformation to another type of deformation occurs around $N=91$ and is likely the cause of this kink structure.</description>

      <title>Jet fragmentation function and groomed substructure of bottom quark jets in proton-proton collisions at 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A measurement of the substructure of bottom quark jets (b jets) in proton-proton (pp) collisions is presented. The measurement uses data collected in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment in 2017, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 301$^{-1}$. An algorithm to identify and cluster the charged decay daughters of b hadrons is developed for this analysis, which facilitates the exposure of the gluon radiation pattern of b jets using iterative Cambridge-Aachen declustering. The soft-drop-groomed jet radius, $R_\mathrm{g}$, and momentum balance, $z_\mathrm{g}$, of b quark jets are presented. These observables can be used to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics predictions that account for mass effects. Because the b hadron is partially reconstructed from its charged decay daughters, only charged particles are used for the jet substructure studies. In addition, a jet fragmentation function, $z_\text{b,ch}$, is measured, which is defined as the distribution of the ratio of the transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) of the partially reconstructed b hadron with respect to the charged-particle component of the jet $p_\mathrm{T}$. The substructure variable distributions are unfolded to the charged-particle level. The b jet substructure is compared to the substructure of jets in an inclusive jet sample that is dominated by light-quark and gluon jets in order to assess the role of the b quark mass. A strong suppression of emissions at small $R_\mathrm{g}$ values is observed for b jets when compared to inclusive jets, consistent with the dead-cone effect. The measurement is also compared with theoretical predictions from Monte Carlo event generators. This is the first substructure measurement of b jets that clusters together the b hadron decay daughters.</description>

      <title>Constraining Neutron Capture Cross Sections for $^{88}\mathrm{Y}$ with Gamma-ray Strength Function in $(p,p^\prime\gamma)$ Surrogate Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate to extract $^{88}\mathrm{Y}(n,\gamma)$ cross sections using the $(p,p'\gamma)$ surrogate reaction with proper treatment of the spin-parity distribution of the compound nucleus $^{89}\mathrm{Y}$. Experimental data of both $\gamma$-decay probability and $\gamma$-ray strength function are used to constrain the nuclear model parameters within a computational framework combining the Bayesian optimization and Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which helps to significantly reduce the $(n,\gamma)$ data uncertainty. The $^{88}\mathrm{Y}(n,\gamma)$ cross sections are then extracted with a narrow uncertainty of 7.6\%-23.1\% within neutron energy range of 0.01 to 3.0 MeV for the first time, where no experimental data are available. Moreover, our method is verified with the $^{88}\mathrm{Sr}(p,\gamma)$ reaction, of which the measured data are available for comparison. This work opens interesting perspectives on the matter of extracting ($n,\gamma$) reaction cross sections on unstable nuclei as surrogate reaction experiments are becoming widely available.</description>

      <title>Sparse Methods for Vector Embeddings of TPC Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are versatile detectors that reconstruct charged-particle tracks in an ionizing medium, enabling sensitive measurements across a wide range of nuclear physics experiments. We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $\beta$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder. We find that even an untrained sparse ResNet model provides useful embeddings of AT-TPC data, and we observe improvements when the model is trained on GADGET data. Together, these results highlight the potential of sparse convolutional techniques as a general tool for representation learning in diverse TPC experiments.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of a $\pi^0\gamma $ pair in the saturation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the exclusive photoproduction of a $\pi^0 \gamma$ pair with large invariant mass, as a promising channel to study the effects of gluon saturation. It has recently been demonstrated that this process is incompatible with a collinear factorization approach in terms of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at the leading twist. In such a situation, a (generalized) $k_T$-dependent factorization at small $x$ is a valid alternative approach. We perform this calculation using the shockwave formalism, which resums multiple gluon exchanges between the projectile and the dense nuclear target. We find that the polarized amplitude changes sign as a function of back-to-back transverse momentum $|\vec{p}_t|$ of the pion-photon pair, resulting in a dip-like structure in the fully differential cross section as a function of $|\vec{p}_t|$.</description>

      <title>Charged-Current Elastic Scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the measurement of the charged-current elastic scattering process $e^-p\rightarrow\nu_e n$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This process provides sensitivity to the poorly constrained axial form factor of the nucleon, which encodes the spatial distribution of weak charge. Collisions of electrons with polarized protons enable measuring the axial form factor via the $e^{-\!}\,\vec{p} \to \nu_e\,n$ target-spin asymmetry for the first time. We conclude that a measurement of charged-current elastic scattering at the EIC will, perhaps unsurprisingly, prove very challenging. However, with dedicated instrumentation at a second EIC detector, the measurement may be possible.</description>

      <title>Understanding neutrino pion production with the GiBUU model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pion production is a major source of systematic uncertainty in neutrino oscillation measurements. We report a systematic investigation of neutrino-induced pion production using MINERvA and MicroBooNE data within the GiBUU theoretical framework. The analysis begins by establishing baseline model parameters using inclusive and pionless data from MINERvA, MicroBooNE, and T2K experiments. We then examine the role of in-medium effects, including resonance broadening and nucleon-nucleon final-state interactions. While agreement with individual datasets can be achieved through specific model configurations, we demonstrate the difficulty of a unified description across all experiments: MINERvA measurements prefer minimum in-medium modifications, whereas MicroBooNE data require the maximum in-medium enhancement, revealing the complexity and richness of the underlying nuclear dynamics.</description>
