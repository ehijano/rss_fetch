      <title>MCHex: Marching Cubes Based Adaptive Hexahedral Mesh Generation with Guaranteed Positive Jacobian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing an adaptive hexahedral tessellation to fit an input triangle boundary is a key challenge in grid-based methods. The conventional method first removes outside elements (RO) and then projects the axis-aligned boundary onto the input triangle boundary, which has no guarantee on improving the initial Intersection over Union (IoU) and Hausdorff distance ratio (HR, w.r.t bounding box diagonal). The proposed MCHex approach replaces RO with a Marching Cubes method MCHex. Given the same computational budget (benchmarked using an identical precomputed Signed Distance Field, which dominates the runtime), MCHex provides better boundary approximation (higher IoU and lower HR) while guaranteeing a lower, yet still positive, minimum scaled Jacobian (&gt;0 vs. RO's &gt;0.48).</description>

      <title>Optimizing Kernel Discrepancies via Subset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel discrepancies are a powerful tool for analyzing worst-case errors in quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Building on recent advances in optimizing such discrepancy measures, we extend the subset selection problem to the setting of kernel discrepancies, selecting an m-element subset from a large population of size $n \gg m$. We introduce a novel subset selection algorithm applicable to general kernel discrepancies to efficiently generate low-discrepancy samples from both the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube, the traditional setting of classical QMC, and from more general distributions $F$ with known density functions by employing the kernel Stein discrepancy. We also explore the relationship between the classical $L_2$ star discrepancy and its $L_\infty$ counterpart.</description>

      <title>MadVoro: Parallel Construction of Voronoi Diagrams in Distributed Memory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voronoi diagrams are essential geometrical structures with numerous applications, particularly astrophysics-driven finite volume methods. While serial algorithms for constructing these entities are well-established, parallel construction remains challenging. This is especially true in distributed memory systems, where each host manages only a subset of the input points. This process requires redistributing points across hosts and accurately computing the corresponding Voronoi cells. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed construction algorithm, which is implemented in our open-source C++ 3-dimensional Voronoi construction framework. Our approach leverages Delaunay triangulation as an intermediate step, which is then transformed into a Voronoi diagram. We introduce the algorithms we implemented for the precise construction and our load-balancing approach and compare the running time with other state-of-the-art frameworks. MadVoro is a versatile tool that can be applied in various scientific domains, such as mesh decomposition, computational physics, chemistry, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Curves, points, incidences and covering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a point set, mostly a grid in our case, we seek upper and lower bounds on the number of curves that are needed to cover the point set. We say a curve covers a point if the curve passes through the point. We consider such coverings by monotonic curves, lines, orthoconvex curves, circles, etc. We also study a problem that is converse of the covering problem -- if a set of $n^2$ points in the plane is covered by $n$ lines then can we say something about the configuration of the points?</description>
