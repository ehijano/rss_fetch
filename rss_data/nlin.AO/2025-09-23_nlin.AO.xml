      <title>Emergent topology of optimal networks for synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world networks, whether shaped by evolution or intelligent design, are typically optimized for some functionality while adhering to physical, geometric, or budget constraints. Yet, theoretical and computational tools for identifying such optimal structures remain limited. We develop a gradient-based optimization framework to identify synchrony-optimal weighted networks under a constrained coupling budget. The resulting networks exhibit a combination of counterintuitive features: they are sparse, bipartite, elongated, and extremely monophilic (i.e., the neighbors of any given node are highly similar to one another while differing from the node itself). These computational findings are matched by a "constructive" theory for optimal networks; a nonlinear differential equation identifies the optimal pairing of nodes for edges, whereas a variational principle prescribes optimal node-strength allocation. The resulting dynamics provably lack the traditional synchronization threshold; instead, as the budget exceeds a calculable critical value, the system becomes globally phase-locked, exhibiting critical scaling at the transition. Our results have broad implications for real-world systems including power grids, neuromorphic computing, and coupled oscillator technologies.</description>

      <title>Exact Dimensional Reduction for Quasi-Linear ODE Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact dimensional reduction for high-dimensional dynamical systems composed of $N$ identical dynamical units governed by quasi-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of order $M$. In these systems, each unit follows a linear differential equation whose coefficients depend nonlinearly on the ensemble variables, such as a mean field variable. We derive $M+1$ closed-form macroscopic equations of order $M$ with variables that exactly capture the full microscopic dimensional dynamics and that allow reconstruction of individual trajectories from the reduced system. Our approach enables low-dimensional analysis of collective behavior in coupled oscillator networks and provides computationally efficient exact representations of large-scale dynamics. We illustrate the theory with examples, highlighting new families of solvable models relevant to physics, biology and engineering that are now amenable to simplified analysis.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Activity Patterns in a Bio-Inspired Hopfield-Type Network in Different Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>
