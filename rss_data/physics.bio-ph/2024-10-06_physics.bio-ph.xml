      <title>Longitudinal photoacoustic monitoring of collagen evolution modulated by cancer-associated fibroblasts: simulation and experiment studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noninvasive in vivo detection of collagen facilitates the investigation of mechanisms by which cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) regulates the extracellular matrix. This study explored the feasibility of photoacoustic spectrum analysis (PASA) in identifying longitudinal changes of collagen modulated by CAFs using simulations and experiment studies. Optical and acoustic simulations in tissues were performed based on the histological slides of maximum cross-sections of murine malignancies to verify the effectiveness of photoacoustic (PA) detection system and the parameter "relative area of power spectrum density (APSD)". Experiments were conducted on three groups of mouse models with incremental ratios of CAFs and breast cancer cells at 3 continuous time points. Results discovered that the system configuration and APSD were capable of reflecting the evolution of collagen during cancer growth. Furthermore, cancers receiving a high dose of CAFs exhibited a suppressed collagen level. The presented methods show great potential for clinical translation of PASA in the field of cancer therapies targeting CAFs.</description>

      <title>Double-Strand Break Clustering: An Economical and Effective Strategy for DNA Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mammalian cells, repair centers for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) have been identified. However, previous researches predominantly rely on methods that induce specific DSBs by cutting particular DNA sequences. The clustering and its spatiotemporal properties of non-specifically DSBs, especially those induced by environmental stresses such as irradiation, remains unclear. In this study, we used Dragonfly microscopy to induce high-precision damage in cells and discovered that DSB clustering during the early stages of DNA damage response (DDR) and repair, but not during the repair plateau phase. Early in DDR, DSB clustered into existing 53BP1 foci. The DSB clustering at different stages has different implications for DNA repair. By controlling the distance between adjacent damage points, we found that the probability of DSB clustering remains constant at distances of 0.8 - 1.4 um, while clustering does not occur beyond 1.4 um. Within the 0.8 um range, the probability of clustering significantly increases due to the phase separation effect of 53BP1. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we developed a dynamic model of 53BP1 foci formation, fission, and fusion. This model accurately predicts experimental outcomes and further demonstrates the temporal and spatial influences on DSB clustering. These results showed that, similarly to specifically induced DSBs, non-specifically induced DSBs can also cluster. The extent of DSB clustering is influenced by both temporal and spatial factors, which provide new insights into the dynamics of DSB clustering and the role of 53BP1 in DNA repair processes. Such findings could enhance our understanding of DNA damage responses and help us improve DNA repair therapies in disease.</description>

      <title>Elastocapillarity-driven surface growth in tumour spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing experimental evidence highlights the relevant role of mechanics in the physiology of solid tumours, even in their early stages. While most of the mathematical models describe tumour growth as a volumetric increase of mass in the bulk, in vitro experiments on tumour spheroids have demonstrated that cell proliferation occurs in a thin layer at the boundary of the cellular aggregate. In this work, we investigate how elasticity and surface tension interact during the development of tumour spheroids. We model the tumour as a hyperelastic material undergoing boundary accretion, where the newly created cells are deformed by the action of surface tension. This growth leads to a frustrated reference configuration, resulting in the appearance of residual stress.Our theoretical framework is validated through experimental results of tumour spheroid cutting. Similar to fully developed tumours, spheroids tend to open when subject to radial cuts. Remarkably, even newly formed spheroids, which lack residual stress, exhibit this behaviour. Through both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we show that this phenomenon is driven by elastocapillary interactions, where the residual stress developed in grown spheroids amplifies the tumour opening. Our model's outcomes align with experimental observations and allow us to estimate the surface tension acting on tumour spheroids.</description>

      <title>Receptors cluster in high-curvature membrane regions for optimal spatial gradient sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial information from cell-surface receptors is crucial for processes that require signal processing and sensing of the environment. Here, we investigate the optimal placement of such receptors through a theoretical model that minimizes uncertainty in gradient estimation. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the physical limits of sensing or biochemical processes, we reproduce the emergence of clusters that closely resemble those observed in real cells. On perfect spherical surfaces, optimally placed receptors spread uniformly. When perturbations break their symmetry, receptors cluster in regions of high curvature, massively reducing estimation uncertainty. This agrees with mechanistic models that minimize elastic preference discrepancies between receptors and cell membranes. We further extend our model to motile receptors responding to cell-shape changes and external fluid flow, demonstrating the relevance of our model in realistic scenarios. Our findings provide a simple and utilitarian explanation for receptor clustering at high-curvature regions when high sensing accuracy is paramount.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic tracking of photo-magnetically powered nanoparticles for cancer therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in vivo propulsion and monitoring of nanoparticles (NPs) have received tremendous achievements in the past decade. Developing functional NPs that can be efficiently manipulated inside the human body with a non-invasive tracking modality is critical to clinical translation. This study synthesized a photo-magnetically powered nanoparticle (PMN) with a Fe3O4 core and gold spiky surface. The Au-nanotips ensure PMNs have a strong light absorption in the second near-infrared (NIR) window and produce outstanding photoacoustic signals. The Bio-transmission electron microscopy and simulation results prove that the assembly of PMNs under a magnetic field further enhances the photothermal conversion in cells, contributing to the reduction of ambient viscosity. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) realized real-time monitoring of PMN movements and revealed that laser plus magnetic coupling couldimprove intratumoral distribution and retention. The proposed methods exhibit excellent potential for the clinical research of cancer nanotherapies.</description>

      <title>Slower swimming promotes chemotactic encounters between bacteria and small phytoplankton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis enables marine bacteria to increase encounters with phytoplankton cells by reducing their search times, provided that bacteria detect noisy chemical gradients around phytoplankton. Gradient detection depends on bacterial phenotypes and phytoplankton size: large phytoplankton produce spatially extended but shallow gradients, whereas small phytoplankton produce steeper but spatially more confined gradients. To date, it has remained unclear how phytoplankton size and bacterial swimming speed affect bacteria's gradient detection ability and search times for phytoplankton. Here, we compute an upper bound on the increase in bacterial encounter rate with phytoplankton due to chemotaxis over random motility alone. We find that chemotaxis can substantially decrease search times for small phytoplankton, but this advantage is highly sensitive to variations in bacterial phenotypes or phytoplankton leakage rates. By contrast, chemotaxis towards large phytoplankton cells reduces the search time more modestly, but this benefit is more robust to variations in search or environmental parameters. Applying our findings to marine phytoplankton communities, we find that, in productive waters, chemotaxis towards phytoplankton smaller than 2 micrometers provides little to no benefit, but can decrease average search times for large phytoplankton (about 20 micrometers) from two weeks to two days, an advantage that is robust to variations and favors bacteria with higher swimming speeds. By contrast, in oligotrophic waters, chemotaxis can reduce search times for picophytoplankton (about 1 micrometer) up to ten-fold, from a week to half a day, but only for bacteria with low swimming speeds and long sensory timescales. This asymmetry may promote the coexistence of diverse search phenotypes in marine bacterial populations.</description>

      <title>Acoustic signaling enables collective perception and control in active matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snake-like self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision-making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.</description>

      <title>A Reaction-Diffusion-Chemotaxis Model for Human Population Dynamics over Fractal Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advection of entities induced by gradients in attractant concentration fields is observed via diffusiophoresis in colloids and via chemotaxis in microorganisms. Mathematically, both diffusiophoresis and chemotaxis follow similar mathematical descriptions and display a variety of interesting behaviors that are not observed through other transport mechanisms. However, the application of such a mathematical framework has largely been restricted to soft matter research. In this article, we argue that this framework is more general and can be expanded to study human population dynamics. We assert that human populations also migrate chemotactically, but by sensing concentrations gradients in attractants such as resource availability, social connections, and safety indices. Therefore, we extend the Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, foundational to human population dynamics, to incorporate chemotactic advection. Furthermore, we introduce a fractal terrain to better mimic the human dispersal phenomena. Simulations demonstrate that, by including chemotaxis of a population toward attractants which are dispersed heterogenously over fractal terrains, population hotspots can appear from from initially uniformly dispersed states whereas Fisher-KPP without chemotaxis predicts a persistent tendency toward population uniformity. Varying the chemotactic migration yields fine control over inter- or intra-population segregation and thus the population growth rates may be substantially altered by considering the population-attractant coupling. This framework may be useful for characterizing historical population separations, and furthermore is particularly pertinent for predicting emergence of new population hotspots as climate change is expected to cause large-scale human displacement, which may be dictated by chemotactic movement of humans due to evolving concentration gradients in safety indices.</description>

      <title>Solvent-cosolvent attraction is sufficient to induce polymer collapse in good solvent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cononsolvency occurs when two miscible, competing good solvents for a polymer are mixed, resulting in a loss of solubility. In this study, we demonstrate through simulations, supported by theory, that cononsolvency can be driven solely by solvent-cosolvent attraction ($\epsilon_{sc}$). The primary mechanism underlying this behavior is the emergent depletion effect, which is amplified by solvent-cosolvent interactions. The polymer reaches a compact state when the solvent and cosolvent fractions are equal ($x_s = x_c = 0.5$), a finding that aligns with predictions from Flory-Huggins theory and the random phase approximation. We show that this cononsolvency behavior is observed for different cosolvent sizes, provided the cosolvent density remains below the depletion threshold and the sizes of solvent and cosolvent particles are not smaller than the monomer size. Additionally, we investigate the role of temperature and find that cononsolvency weakens as temperature increases, due to a reduction in the depletion effect. Finally, we show that when preferential cosolvent attraction is introduced in this simple model, it leads to cononsolvency driven by bridging interactions, occurring at lower cosolvent fractions ($x_c &lt; 0.5$).</description>
