      <title>Learning Model Parameter Dynamics in a Combination Therapy for Bladder Cancer from Sparse Biological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to learn time-varying interactions between cells, such as those of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their response to a combination of anticancer treatments in a limited data scenario. We employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at time points where no observed data are available. We demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the biological explanation of subpopulation trajectories. Our method provides a framework for learning evolving interactions among biological organisms when external interventions are applied to their environment.</description>

      <title>Motility-Driven Viscoelastic Control of Tissue Morphology in Presomitic Mesoderm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embryonic tissues deform across broad spatial and temporal scales and relax stress through active rearrangements. A quantitative link between cell-scale activity, spatial forcing, and emergent tissue-scale mechanics remains incomplete. Here, we use a vertex-based tissue model with active force fluctuations to study how motility controls viscoelastic response. After validation against experimental presomitic mesoderm relaxation dynamics, we extract intrinsic mechanical timescales using stress relaxation and oscillatory shear. The model captures motility-dependent shifts between elastic and viscous behavior and the coexistence of fast relaxation with long-lived residual stress. When subjected to spatially patterned, temporally pulsed forcing, tissues behave as mechanical filters: long-wavelength inputs are accumulated, whereas short-wavelength, cell-scale perturbations are rapidly erased, largely independent of motility. Simulations with localized motility hotspots, motivated by spatially confined FGF signaling reported in vertebrate limb development, produce sustained protrusive tissue deformations consistent with experimentally observed early bud-like morphologies. Together, these results establish a minimal framework linking motility-driven activity to wavelength-selective mechanical memory and emergent tissue patterning.</description>
