      <title>A Construction of the Symmetric Monoidal Structure of the Geometric Whittaker Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ and let $\ell$ be a prime number different from $p$. Let $U \subseteq G$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup, $T$ a maximal torus normalizing $U$ and $W$ the Weyl group of $G$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a non-degenerate multiplicative $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell} $-local system on $U$. In \cite{bd}, the authors show that the bi-Whittaker category, namely the triangulated monoidal category of $(U, \mathcal{L})$-biequivariant $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell}$-complexes on $G$ is monoidally equivalent to an explicit thick triangulated monoidal subcategory $\mathscrsfs{D}_{W}^{\circ}(T) \subseteq \mathscrsfs{D}_{W}(T)$ of "central sheaves" on the torus. In particular it has the structure of a symmetric monoidal category coming from the symmetric monoidal structure on $\mathscrsfs{D}_W(T)$.
  In this paper, we give another construction of a symmetric monoidal structure on the above category and prove that it agrees with the one coming from the above construction. For this, among other things, we generalize a proof by Gelfand (ref. \cite{car}) for finite groups to the geometric setup.</description>

      <title>Machine Checked Proofs and Programs in Algebraic Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a library of formalized results around symmetric functions and the character theory of symmetric groups. Written in Coq/Rocq and based on the Mathematical Components library, it covers a large part of the contents of a graduate level textbook in the field. The flagship result is a proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule, which computes the structure constants of the algebra of symmetric function in the schur basis which are integer numbers appearing in various fields of mathematics, and which has a long history of wrong proofs. A specific feature of algebraic combinatorics is the constant interplay between algorithms and algebraic constructions: algorithms are not only in computations, but also are key ingredients in definitions and proofs. As such, the proof of the Littlewood-Richardson rule deeply relies on the understanding of the execution of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm. Many results in this library are effective and actually used in computer algebra systems, and we discuss their certified implementation.</description>

      <title>Center of affine $\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}$ at the critical level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we shall describe the center of the universal affine vertex superalgebra $V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak g)$ associated with $\mathfrak g=\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}, \mathfrak {gl}_{2|1}$ at the critical level $\kappa_c$ and prove the conjecture of A. Molev and E. Ragoucy in this case.
  The center $\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ turns out to be isomorphic to the large level limit $\ell \rightarrow \infty$ of a vertex subalgebra, called the parafermion vertex algebra $K^{\ell} (\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, of the affine vertex algebra $V^\ell(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. The key ingredient of the proof is to understand the principal $W$-superalgebra $ W^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1})$ at the critical level. It relates the center $\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl} _{2|1}))$ to $V^\infty(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ via the Kazama-Suzuki duality while it has a surprising coincidence with $V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1})$, whose center has been recently described. Moreover, the centers $\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ and $\mathfrak{z}(W^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ are proven to coincide as a byproduct.
  A general conjecture is proposed which describes the center $\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{n|m}))$ with $n&gt;m$ as a large level limit of ``the dual side'', i.e., the parafermion-type subalgebras of $W$-algebras $ W^\ell(\mathfrak{sl}_{n}, \mathbb{O}_{[n-m,1^m]})$ associated with hook-type partitions $[n-m,1^m]$, known also as vertex algebras at the corner.</description>

      <title>Barcoding Invariants and Their Equivalent Discriminating Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistence barcode (equivalently, the persistence diagram), which can be obtained from the interval decomposition of a persistence module, plays a pivotal role in applications of persistent homology. For multi-parameter persistent homology, which lacks a complete discrete invariant, and where persistence modules are no longer always interval decomposable, many alternative invariants have been proposed. Many of these invariants are akin to persistence barcodes, in that they assign (possibly signed) multisets of intervals. Furthermore, those invariants assign any interval decomposable module to its corresponding multiset of intervals. Naturally, identifying the relationships among invariants of this type, or ordering them by their discriminating power, is a fundamental question. To address this, we formalize the notion of barcoding invariants and compare their discriminating powers. Notably, this formalization enables us to prove that all barcoding invariants with the same basis possess equivalent discriminating power. One implication of our result is that introducing a new barcoding invariant does not add any value in terms of its generic discriminating power, even if the new invariant is distinct from the existing barcoding invariants. This suggests the need for a more flexible and adaptable comparison framework for barcoding invariants. Along the way, we generalize several recent results on the discriminative power of invariants for poset representations within our unified framework.</description>

      <title>Characters of symmetric groups: sharp bounds on virtual degrees and the Witten zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sharp bounds on the virtual degrees introduced by Larsen and Shalev. This leads to improved bounds on characters of symmetric groups. We then sharpen bounds of Liebeck and Shalev concerning the Witten zeta function. Our main application is a characterization of the fixed-point free conjugacy classes whose associated random walk mixes in 2 steps.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-invariants via Quot schemes II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a $K$-theoretic analogue of the Vafa--Intriligator formula, computing the (virtual) Euler characteristics of vector bundles over the Quot scheme that compactifies the space of degree $d$ morphisms from a fixed projective curve to the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(r,N)$. As an application, we deduce interesting vanishing results, used in Part I (arXiv:2406.12191) to study the quantum $K$-ring of $\mathrm{Gr}(r,N)$. In the genus-zero case, we prove a simplified formula involving Schur functions, consistent with the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem in the degree-zero setting. These new formulas offer a novel approach for computing the structure constants of quantum $K$-products.</description>
