      <title>On the Order of Products of Coprime Elements in Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the subgroups $D_m(G)$ and $D_{m,n}(G)$, defined in terms of the orders of products of coprime elements in a finite group $G$. We show that both subgroups are characteristic, that $D_{m,n}(G)$ is always nilpotent, and that their nilpotent structure provides a characterization of Frobenius group decompositions. Furthermore, we define the $E$-series, which extends this framework to the study of an important class of solvable groups of Fitting height at most $4$. We prove that a finite group $G$ has an $E$-series of length at most $4$ if and only if there exists a characteristic subgroup $F \leq G$ such that $G/F$ is nilpotent and $F$ is either nilpotent, a Frobenius group, or a $2$-Frobenius group.</description>

      <title>On Uniformly Perfect Morse Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and geometrically characterize the notion of uniformly perfect Morse boundary for proper geodesic metric spaces. As a unifying result, we prove that the Morse boundary of any finitely generated, non-elementary group is uniformly perfect whenever it is nonempty. This theorem applies to a broad class of groups, including all acylindrically hyperbolic groups, Artin groups, and hierarchically hyperbolic groups.
  Furthermore, we establish a rigidity theorem for homeomorphisms between such boundaries: for any two spaces with uniformly perfect Morse boundaries, a homeomorphism is induced by a quasi-isometry if and only if it satisfies any one of several natural geometric conditions. These conditions include being bi-H\"older, quasi-conformal, quasi-symmetric, or $2$-stable and quasi-M\"obius.</description>

      <title>Minimum $\mathcal{F}$-covers: the supersolvable and metabelian cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $\mathcal{F}$ of finite groups, it is said that a group $G$ is an $\mathcal{F}$-cover if every group in $\mathcal{F}$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G$. Moreover, $G$ is a minimum $\mathcal{F}$-cover if there is no $\mathcal{F}$-cover whose order is less than $|G|$. In [Cameron P. J., et al., Minimal cover groups, J. Algebra 660 (2024)], the authors pose the following question: For which classes $\mathcal{X}$ of groups, closed under taking subgroups and direct products, is it true that, if $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of $\mathcal{X}$-groups, then there is a minimum $\mathcal{F}$-cover which is an $\mathcal{X}$-group? In this paper, we give a negative answer in two cases: $\mathcal{X}\in \{``supersolvable", ``metabelian"\}.$</description>

      <title>On some problems regarding $LCM$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and denote by $o(g)$ the order of an element $g\in G$. We say that $G$ is an $LCM$-group if $o(x^ny)$ is a divisor of the least common multiple of $o(x^n)$ and $o(y)$ for all $x, y\in G$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This paper extends some existing results on $LCM$-groups, such as the structure of a minimal non-$LCM$-group, and establishes criteria for $G$ to be an $LCM$-group or a nilpotent group. We also prove that, in general, a minimum cover of a finite set of $LCM$-groups is not an $LCM$-group, and we answer two questions posed by M. Amiri.</description>

      <title>Factors in finite groups and well-covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a combinatorial property of subsets in finite groups that is analogous to the notion of independence in graphs. Given a group $G$ and a non-empty subset $A\subset G$, we define a (right) $s$-factor as a subset $B\subset G$ satisfying the following conditions:
  (i) Every element of $AB$ can be written uniquely as $ab$ with $a\in A$ and $b\in B$.
  (ii) $B$ is maximal (with respect to inclusion) with this property.
  For a finite group $G$, the upper and lower indices of $A$ are the sizes of the largest and smallest $s$-factors associated with $A$. A subset is called stable if its upper and lower indices coincide. A group is called stable if all its subsets are stable.
  We then explore the connection between $s$-factors in groups and maximal independent sets in graphs. Specifically, we show that $s$-factors in $G$ associated with $A$ correspond to maximal independent sets in a Cayley graph Cay($G$, $S$), where $S=A^{-1}A\setminus\{e\}$. Consequently, the upper and lower indices of $A$ are equal to the independence number and the independent domination number of the associated Cayley graph.
  The concepts of $s$-factors, subset indices in groups, stable subsets, and stable groups (under different names) were introduced by Hooshmand in 2020. Later, Hooshmand and Yousefian-Arani classified stable groups using computer calculations.
  Using the connection with graphs, we compute the upper and lower indices for various groups and their subsets. Furthermore, we prove a classification theorem describing all stable groups without relying on computer calculations.</description>

      <title>Unitarising measures for Kac-Moody algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact connected Lie group $G$ with dual Coxeter number $\check h$ and a level $\kappa&lt;-2\check h$, we introduce a probability measure $\nu_\kappa$ on the space of holomorphic $\mathfrak g_{\mathbb C}$-valued $(1,0)$-forms in $\mathbb D$, in relation to the K\"ahler geometry of the loop group of $G$ and the action of a pair of Kac--Moody algebras at respective levels $\kappa$ and $-2\check h-\kappa&gt;0$. We prove that $\nu_\kappa$ is characterised by a covariance property making rigorous sense of the formal path integral ``$\mathrm d\nu_\kappa(\gamma)=e^{-\check\kappa\mathscr{S}(\gamma)}D\gamma$", where $D\gamma$ is the non-existent Haar measure on the loop group and $\mathscr S$ is a K\"ahler potential for the right-invariant Kac--Moody metric. Infinitesimally, the covariance formula prescribes the Shapovalov forms of the Kac--Moody representations.</description>

      <title>From cubic norm pairs to $G_2$- and $F_4$-graded groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Lie algebras arising from cubic norm pairs over arbitrary commutative base rings. Such Lie algebras admit a grading by a root system of type $G_2$, and when the cubic norm pair is a cubic Jordan matrix algebra, the $G_2$-grading can be further refined to an $F_4$-grading. We then use these Lie algebras and their gradings to construct corresponding root graded groups. Along the way, we produce many results providing detailed information about the structure of these Lie algebras and groups.</description>

      <title>Exceptional groups and the $s$-arc-transitivity of vertex-primitive digraphs, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the primitive actions of almost simple exceptional groups of Lie type on \(s\)-arc-transitive digraphs. Our motivation is the following question posed by Giudici and Xia: Is there an upper bound on $s$ for finite vertex-primitive $s$-arc-transitive digraphs that are not directed cycles? In a 2018 paper, Giudici and Xia reduced this question to the case where the automorphism group of the digraph is an almost simple group with socle \(L\). Subsequently, it has been proved that $s\leq 2$ when \(L\) is a linear, symplectic or alternating group, and $s\leq 1$ when \(L\) is a Suzuki group, a small Ree group, or one of $22$ specific sporadic groups. In this paper, we prove that $s\leq 2$ when \(L\) is $ {}^3D_4(q)$, $G_2(q)$ (including $G_2(2)'$), ${}^2F_4(q)$ (including ${}^2F_4(2)'$), $F_4(q)$, $E_6(q)$ or ${}^2E_6(q)$.</description>

      <title>Higher Kazhdan property and unitary cohomology of arithmetic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Notions of higher Kazhdan property can be defined in terms of vanishing of unitary group cohomology in higher degrees. Garland's theorem for simple groups over non-archimedean fields provides the first examples of a higher Kazhdan property. We prove a version of Garland's theorem for simple Lie groups and their lattices. We generalize theorems of Borel and Borel-Yang about the invariance of the cohomology of lattices in semisimple Lie groups and adelic groups by improving the stability range and allowing for arbitrary unitary representations as coefficients. A novelty of our approach is the use of methods from geometric group theory and -- in the case of rank 1 -- from Clozel's work on the spectral gap property.</description>

      <title>Critical Exponent Rigidity for $\Theta-$positive Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove for a $\Theta-$positive representation from a discrete subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, the critical exponent for any $\alpha\in \Theta$ is not greater than one. When $\Gamma$ is geometrically finite, the equality holds if and only if $\Gamma$ is a lattice.</description>
