      <title>A quantum neural network framework for scalable quantum circuit approximation of unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Lie group theoretic approach for parametric representation of unitary matrices. This leads to develop a quantum neural network framework for quantum circuit approximation of multi-qubit unitary gates. Layers of the neural networks are defined by product of exponential of certain elements of the Standard Recursive Block Basis, which we introduce as an alternative to Pauli string basis for matrix algebra of complex matrices of order $2^n$. The recursive construction of the neural networks implies that the quantum circuit approximation is scalable i.e. quantum circuit for an $(n+1)$-qubit unitary can be constructed from the circuit of $n$-qubit system by adding a few CNOT gates and single-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Recovering noise-free quantum observables"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) stands as the most widespread quantum error mitigation technique in order to aim the recovery of noise-free expectation values of observables of interest by means of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines. Recently, Otten and Gray proposed a multidimensional generalization of poynomial ZNE for systems where there is not a tunable global noise source [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{99,} 012338 (2019)]. Specifically, the authors refer to multiqubit systems where each of the qubits experiences several noise processes with different rates, i.e. a non-identically distributed noise model. While effective, the proposed method presents an unbearable experiment repetition overhead, making it impractical, at least from the perspective of quantum computing. In this comment, we show that the traditional extrapolation techniques can be applied for such non-identically distributed noise setting consisted of many different noise sources, implying that the measurement overhead is reduced considerably. For doing so, we clarify what it is meant by a tunable global noise source in the context of ZNE, concept that we consider important to be clarified for a correct understanding about how and why these methods work.</description>

      <title>Structure learning of Hamiltonians from real-time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of Hamiltonian structure learning from real-time evolution: given the ability to apply $e^{-\mathrm{i} Ht}$ for an unknown local Hamiltonian $H = \sum_{a = 1}^m \lambda_a E_a$ on $n$ qubits, the goal is to recover $H$. This problem is already well-studied under the assumption that the interaction terms, $E_a$, are given, and only the interaction strengths, $\lambda_a$, are unknown. But is it possible to learn a local Hamiltonian without prior knowledge of its interaction structure?
  We present a new, general approach to Hamiltonian learning that not only solves the challenging structure learning variant, but also resolves other open questions in the area, all while achieving the gold standard of Heisenberg-limited scaling. In particular, our algorithm recovers the Hamiltonian to $\varepsilon$ error with an evolution time scaling with $1/\varepsilon$, and has the following appealing properties: (1) it does not need to know the Hamiltonian terms; (2) it works beyond the short-range setting, extending to any Hamiltonian $H$ where the sum of terms interacting with a qubit has bounded norm; (3) it evolves according to $H$ in constant time $t$ increments, thus achieving constant time resolution. To our knowledge, no prior algorithm with Heisenberg-limited scaling existed with even one of these properties. As an application, we can also learn Hamiltonians exhibiting power-law decay up to accuracy $\varepsilon$ with total evolution time beating the standard limit of $1/\varepsilon^2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Doeblin coefficients: A simple upper bound on contraction coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contraction coefficients give a quantitative strengthening of the data processing inequality. As such, they have many natural applications whenever closer analysis of information processing is required. However, it is often challenging to calculate these coefficients. As a remedy we discuss a quantum generalization of Doeblin coefficients. These give an efficiently computable upper bound on many contraction coefficients. We prove several properties and discuss generalizations and applications. In particular, we give additional stronger bounds for PPT channels and introduce reverse Doeblin coefficients that bound certain expansion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Engineering superpositions of N00N states using an asymmetric non-linear Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a method for mapping arbitrary single-mode pure states into superpositions of N00N states using an asymmetric non-linear Mach-Zehnder interferometer (ANLMZI). This method would allow for one to tailor-make superpositions of N00N states where each axis of the two-mode joint-photon number distribution is weighted by the statistics of any single-mode pure state. The non-linearity of the ANLMZI comes in the form of a $\chi^{\left(3\right)}$ self-Kerr interaction occurring on one of the intermediary modes of the interferometer. Motivated by the non-classical interference effects that occur at a beam splitter, we introduce inverse-engineering techniques aimed towards extrapolating optimal transformations for generating N00N state superpositions. These techniques are general enough so as to be employed to probe the means of generating states of any desired quantum properties.</description>

      <title>Averting multi-qubit burst errors in surface code magic state factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on the assumption of time-invariant, sufficiently low physical error rates. However, current superconducting quantum computers suffer from frequent disruptive noise events, including cosmic ray impacts and shifting two-level system defects. Several methods have been proposed to mitigate these issues in software, but they add large overheads in terms of physical qubit count, as it is difficult to preserve logical information through burst error events. We focus on mitigating multi-qubit burst errors in magic state factories, which are expected to comprise up to 95% of the space cost of future quantum programs. Our key insight is that magic state factories do not need to preserve logical information over time; once we detect an increase in local physical error rates, we can simply turn off parts of the factory that are affected, re-map the factory to the new chip geometry, and continue operating. This is much more efficient than previous more general methods, and is resilient even under many simultaneous impact events. Using precise physical noise models, we show an efficient ray detection method and evaluate our strategy in different noise regimes. Compared to existing baselines, we find reductions in ray-induced overheads by several orders of magnitude, reducing total qubitcycle cost by geomean 6.5x to 13.9x depending on the noise model. This work reduces the burden on hardware by providing low-overhead software mitigation of these errors.</description>

      <title>Distribution of lowest eigenvalue in $k$-body bosonic random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue of finite many-boson systems with $k$-body interactions modeled by Bosonic Embedded Gaussian Orthogonal [BEGOE($k$)] and Unitary [BEGUE($k$)] random matrix Ensembles. Following the recently established result that the $q$-normal describes the smooth form of the eigenvalue density of the $k$-body embedded ensembles, the first four moments of the distribution of lowest eigenvalues have been analyzed as a function of the $q$ parameter, with $q \sim 1$ for $k = 1$ and $q = 0$ for $k = m$; $m$ being the number of bosons. Our results show the distribution exhibits a smooth transition from Gaussian like for $q$ close to 1 to a modified Gumbel like for intermediate values of $q$ to the well-known Tracy-Widom distribution for $q=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation enables reliable quantum computation but incurs a significant overhead from both time and resource perspectives. To reduce computation time, Austin G. Fowler proposed time-optimal quantum computation by constructing a quantum circuit for a fault-tolerant $T$ gate without probabilistic $S$ gate correction. In this work, we introduce a resource-compact quantum circuit that significantly reduces resource requirements by more than 60% for a fault-tolerant $T$ gate without probabilistic $S$ gate correction. Consequently, we present a quantum circuit that minimizes resource utilization for time-optimal quantum computation, demonstrating efficient time-optimal quantum computation. Additionally, we describe an efficient form involving initialization, CNOTs, and measurements, laying the foundation for the development of an efficient compiler for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac equation has resided among the greatest successes of modern physics since its emergence as the first quantum mechanical theory fully compatible with special relativity. This compatibility ensures that the expectation value of the velocity is less than the vacuum speed of light. Here, we show that the Dirac equation admits free-particle solutions where the peak amplitude of the wavefunction can travel at any velocity, including those exceeding the vacuum speed of light, despite having a subluminal velocity expectation value. The solutions are constructed by superposing basis functions with correlations in momentum space. These arbitrary velocity wavefunctions feature a near-constant profile and may impact quantum mechanical processes that are sensitive to the local value of the probability density as opposed to expectation values.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of the Caldeira-Leggett model with non-equilibrium Gaussian reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-equilibrium version of the Caldeira-Leggett model in which a quantum particle is strongly coupled to a set of engineered reservoirs. The reservoirs are composed by collections of squeezed and displaced thermal modes, in contrast to the standard case in which the modes are assumed to be at equilibrium. The model proves to be very versatile. Strongly displaced/squeezed reservoirs can be used to generate an effective time dependence in the system Hamiltonian and can be identified as sources of pure work. In the case of squeezing, the time dependence is stochastic and breaks the fluctuation-dissipation relation, this can be reconciled with the second law of thermodynamics by correctly accounting for the energy used to generate the initial non-equilibrium conditions. To go beyond the average description and compute the full heat statistics, we treat squeezing and displacement as generalized Hamiltonians on a modified Keldysh contour. As an application of this technique, we show the quantum-classical correspondence between the heat statistics in the non-equilibrium Caldeira-Leggett model and the statistics of a classical Langevin particle under the action of squeezed and displaced colored noises. Finally, we discuss thermodynamic symmetries of the heat generating function, proving a fluctuation theorem for the energy balance and showing that the conservation of energy at the trajectory level emerges in the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Optimized Distribution of Entanglement Graph States in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building large-scale quantum computers, essential to demonstrating quantum advantage, is a key challenge. Quantum Networks (QNs) can help address this challenge by enabling the construction of large, robust, and more capable quantum computing platforms by connecting smaller quantum computers. Moreover, unlike classical systems, QNs can enable fully secured long-distance communication. Thus, quantum networks lie at the heart of the success of future quantum information technologies. In quantum networks, multipartite entangled states distributed over the network help implement and support many quantum network applications for communications, sensing, and computing. Our work focuses on developing optimal techniques to generate and distribute multipartite entanglement states efficiently. Prior works on generating general multipartite entanglement states have focused on the objective of minimizing the number of maximally entangled pairs (EPs) while ignoring the heterogeneity of the network nodes and links as well as the stochastic nature of underlying processes. In this work, we develop a hypergraph based linear programming framework that delivers optimal (under certain assumptions) generation schemes for general multipartite entanglement represented by graph states, under the network resources, decoherence, and fidelity constraints, while considering the stochasticity of the underlying processes. We illustrate our technique by developing generation schemes for the special cases of path and tree graph states, and discuss optimized generation schemes for more general classes of graph states. Using extensive simulations over a quantum network simulator (NetSquid), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed techniques and show that they outperform prior known schemes by up to orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheduling for Accelerating Neural Network Training with Newton's Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability.
  Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\cdot\kappa \log(N\cdot\kappa/\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\kappa$, error tolerance~$\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\kappa$ and $d$).
  We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating &amp; reducing $\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver.
  Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics of quantum Brownian motion based on the exact solution of its reduced density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the quantum thermodynamics of quantum Brownian motion from the exact solution of its reduced density matrix. By exactly traced over all the reservoir states, we solve analytically and exactly the reduced density matrix of the Brownian particle from the total equilibrium thermal state of the system strongly entangling with its reservoir. We find that the reduced Hamiltonian and the reduced partition function of the Brownian particle must be renormalized significantly, as be generally shown in the nonperturbative renormalization theory of quantum thermodynamics we developed recently. A momentum-dependent potential is generated naturally from the linear coupling between the Brownian particle and the reservoir particles, after all the reservoir states are completely traced out. Moreover, beyond the weak coupling limit, it is imperative to take into account the non-negligible changes of the reservoir state induced by the system-reservoir coupling, in order to obtain the correctly reduced partition function of the Brownian particle. Using the exact solutions of the reduced density matrix, the renormalized Hamiltonian and the reduced partition function for the Brownian particle, we show that the controversial results from the different definitions of internal energy and the issue of the negative heat capacity in the previous studies of strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics are resolved.</description>

      <title>QUACK: Quantum Aligned Centroid Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) seems to show potential for application in machine learning (ML). In particular quantum kernel methods (QKM) exhibit promising properties for use in supervised ML tasks. However, a major disadvantage of kernel methods is their unfavorable quadratic scaling with the number of training samples. Together with the limits imposed by currently available quantum hardware (NISQ devices) with their low qubit coherence times, small number of qubits, and high error rates, the use of QC in ML at an industrially relevant scale is currently impossible. As a small step in improving the potential applications of QKMs, we introduce QUACK, a quantum kernel algorithm whose time complexity scales linear with the number of samples during training, and independent of the number of training samples in the inference stage. In the training process, only the kernel entries for the samples and the centers of the classes are calculated, i.e. the maximum shape of the kernel for n samples and c classes is (n, c). During training, the parameters of the quantum kernel and the positions of the centroids are optimized iteratively. In the inference stage, for every new sample the circuit is only evaluated for every centroid, i.e. c times. We show that the QUACK algorithm nevertheless provides satisfactory results and can perform at a similar level as classical kernel methods with quadratic scaling during training. In addition, our (simulated) algorithm is able to handle high-dimensional datasets such as MNIST with 784 features without any dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase as a Resource for Quantum Enhanced Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are a special phase of matter in which time translational symmetry is broken through a periodic driving pulse. Here, we first propose and characterize an effective mechanism to generate a stable discrete time crystal phase in a disorder-free many-body system with indefinite persistent oscillations even in finite-size systems. Then we explore the sensing capability of this system to measure the spin exchange coupling. The results show strong super-Heisenberg precision, in terms of system size, throughout the time crystal phase. As the spin exchange coupling varies, the system goes through a sharp phase transition and enters a non-time crystal phase in which the performance of the probe considerably decreases. We characterize this phase transition as a second-order type and determine its critical properties through a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. The performance of our probe is independent of the initial states and may even benefit from imperfections in the driving pulse.</description>

      <title>Multi-Path and Multi-Particle Tests of the Dimensionality of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axioms of quantum mechanics provide limited information regarding the structure of the Hilbert space, such as the underlying number system. The latter is generally regarded as complex, but generalizations of complex numbers, so-called hyper-complex numbers, cannot be ruled out in theory. Therefore, specialized experiments to test for hyper-complex quantum mechanics are needed. To date, experimental tests are limited to single-particle interference exploiting a closed phase relation in three-path interference called the Peres test. In this work, we reveal an elegant matrix formalism to derive the Peres test putting it on a solid mathematical ground. On this basis, we introduce multi-path and multi-particle interference tests, which provide a direct probe for the dimensionality of the number system of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an atom interferometer measurement protocol compatible with operation on a dynamic platform. Our method employs two open interferometers, derived from the same atomic source, with different interrogation times to eliminate initial velocity dependence while retaining precision, accuracy, and long term stability. We validate the protocol by measuring gravitational tides, achieving a precision of 4.5 {\mu}Gal in 2000 runs, marking the first demonstration of inertial quantity measurement with open atom interferometry that achieves long-term phase stability.</description>

      <title>Pure State Inspired Lossless Post-selected Quantum Metrology of Mixed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an ensemble of identical pure quantum states that depend on an unknown parameter, recently it was shown that the quantum Fisher information can be losslessly compressed into a subensemble with a much smaller number of samples. However, generalization to mixed states leads to a technical challenge that is formidable to overcome directly. In this work, we avoid such technicality by unveiling the physics of a featured lossless post-selection measurement: while the post-selected quantum state is unchanged, the parametric derivative of the density operator is amplified by a large factor equal to the square root of the inverse of the post-selection success probability. This observation not only clarifies the intuition and essence of post-selected quantum metrology but also allows us to develop a mathematically compact theory for the lossless post-selection of mixed states. We find that if the parametric derivative of the density operator of a mixed state, or alternatively the symmetric logarithmic derivative, vanishes on the support of the density matrix, lossless post-selection can be achieved with an arbitrarily large amplification factor. We exemplify with the examples of superresolution imaging and unitary encoding of mixed initial states. Our results are useful for realistic post-selected quantum metrology in the presence of decoherence and of foundational interests to several problems in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and fidelity across quantum phase transitions in locally perturbed topological codes with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological-to-non-topological quantum phase transitions (QPTs) occurring in the Kitaev code under local perturbations in the form of local magnetic field and spin-spin interactions of the Ising-type using fidelity susceptibility (FS) and entanglement as the probes. We assume the code to be embedded on the surface of a wide cylinder of height $M$ and circumference $D$ with $M\ll D$. We demonstrate a power-law divergence of FS across the QPT, and determine the quantum critical points (QCPs) via a finite-size scaling analysis. We verify these results by mapping the perturbed Kitaev code to the 2D Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, and computing the single-site magnetization as order parameter using quantum Monte-Carlo technique. We also point out an odd-even dichotomy in the occurrence of the QPT in the Kitaev ladder with respect to the odd and even values of $D$, when the system is perturbed with only Ising interaction. Our results also indicate a higher robustness of the topological phase of the Kitaev code against local perturbations if the boundary is made open along one direction. We further consider a local entanglement witness operator designed specifically to capture a lower bound to the localizable entanglement on the vertical non-trivial loop of the code. We show that the first derivative of the expectation value of the witness operator exhibits a logarithmic divergence across the QPT, and perform the finite-size scaling analysis. We demonstrate similar behaviour of the expectation value of the appropriately constructed witness operator also in the case of locally perturbed color code with open boundaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for N-1 security in power grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the supply and demand of electricity has significantly increased. As a result, the interconnecting grid infrastructure has required (and will continue to require) further expansion, while allowing for rapid resolution of unforeseen failures. Energy grid operators strive for networks that satisfy different levels of security requirements. In the case of N-1 security for medium voltage networks, the goal is to ensure the continued provision of electricity in the event of a single-link failure. However, the process of determining if networks are N-1 secure is known to scale polynomially in the network size. This poses restrictions if we increase our demand of the network. In that case, more computationally hard cases will occur in practice and the computation time also increases significantly. In this work, we explore the potential of quantum computers to provide a more scalable solution. In particular, we consider gate-based quantum computing, quantum annealing, and photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Global Minimum Finder based on Variational Quantum Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for global minima is a critical challenge across multiple fields including engineering, finance, and artificial intelligence, particularly with non-convex functions that feature multiple local optima, complicating optimization efforts. We introduce the Quantum Global Minimum Finder (QGMF), an innovative quantum computing approach that efficiently identifies global minima. QGMF combines binary search techniques to shift the objective function to a suitable position and then employs Variational Quantum Search to precisely locate the global minimum within this targeted subspace. Designed with a low-depth circuit architecture, QGMF is optimized for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, utilizing the logarithmic benefits of binary search to enhance scalability and efficiency. This work demonstrates the impact of QGMF in advancing the capabilities of quantum computing to overcome complex non-convex optimization challenges effectively.</description>

      <title>Floquet geometric entangling gates in ground-state manifolds of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the Floquet theory for constructing quantum entangling gates in ground-state manifolds of Rydberg atoms. By dynamically controlling periodically modulating the Rabi frequencies of transitions between ground and Rydberg states of atoms, error-resilient two-qubit entangling gates can be implemented in the regime of Rydberg blockade. According to different degrees of Floquet theory utilization, the fidelity of the resulting controlled gates surpasses that of the original reference. Our method only uses encoding in the ground states, and compared to the original scheme using Rydberg state for encoding, it is less susceptible to environmental interference, making it more practical to implement. Therefore, our approach may have broader applications or potential for further expansion of geometric quantum computation with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Noiseless Loss Suppression for Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Mi\v{c}uda et al. (arXiv:1206.2852v1) suggests that pairing noiseless amplification with noiseless attenuation can conditionally suppress loss terms in the direct transmission of quantum states. Here we extend this work to entangled states: first, we explore bipartite states, specifically the two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) and NOON states; and second, we examine M-partite states, concentrating on W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. In analogy with the original proposal, our results demonstrate that in each case under consideration, a correct combination of attenuation and amplification techniques before and after transmission through a pure loss channel can restore the initial quantum state. However, we find that for both W and NOON states, the noiseless attenuation is redundant and not required to achieve loss term suppression. This work clarifies the role of noiseless attenuation when paired with noiseless amplification for entanglement distribution and provides an operational example of how GHZ and W state entanglement differs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose digital-analog quantum kernels for enhancing the detection of complex features in the classification of images. We consider multipartite-entangled analog blocks, stemming from native Ising interactions in neutral-atom quantum processors, and individual operations as digital steps to implement the protocol. To further improving the detection of complex features, we apply multiple quantum kernels by varying the qubit connectivity according to the hardware constraints. An architecture that combines non-trainable quantum kernels and standard convolutional neural networks is used to classify realistic medical images, from breast cancer and pneumonia diseases, with a significantly reduced number of parameters. Despite this fact, the model exhibits better performance than its classical counterparts and achieves comparable metrics according to public benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the relevance of digital-analog encoding, paving the way for surpassing classical models in image recognition approaching us to quantum-advantage regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informationally overcomplete measurements find important applications in quantum tomography and quantum state estimation. The most popular are maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for which trace relations between measurement operators are well known. In this paper, we introduce a more general class of informationally overcomplete POVMs that are generated by equiangular tight frames of arbitrary rank. This class provides a generalization of equiangular measurements to non-projective POVMs, which include rescaled mutually unbiased measurements and bases. We provide a method of their construction, analyze their symmetry properties, and provide examples for highly symmetric cases. In particular, we find a wide class of generalized equiangular measurements that are conical 2-designs, which allows us to derive the index of coincidence. Our results show benefits of considering a single informationally overcomplete measurement over informationally complete collections of POVMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with $SU(2)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis and Self-Oscillations in an Artificial Memristive Quantum Neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study an artificial neuron circuit containing a quantum memristor in the presence of relaxation and dephasing. The charge transport in the quantum element is realized via tunneling of a charge through a quantum particle which shuttles between two terminals -- a functionality reminiscent of classical diffusive memristors. We demonstrate that this physical principle enables hysteretic behavior of the current-voltage characteristics of the quantum device. In addition, being used in artificial neural circuit, the quantum switcher is able to generate self-sustained current oscillations. Our analysis reveals that these self-oscillations are triggered only in quantum regime with a moderate rate of relaxation, and cannot exist either in a purely coherent regime or at a very high decoherence. We investigate the hysteresis and instability leading to the onset of current self-oscillations and analyze their properties depending on the circuit parameters. Our results provide a generic approach to the use of quantum regimes for controlling hysteresis and generating self-oscillations.</description>

      <title>Linearly simplified QAOA parameters and transferability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides a way to solve combinatorial optimization problems using quantum computers. QAOA circuits consist of time evolution operators by the cost Hamiltonian and of state mixing operators, and embedded variational parameter for each operator is tuned so that the expectation value of the cost function is minimized. The optimization of the variational parameters is taken place on classical devices while the cost function is measured in the sense of quantum. To facilitate the classical optimization, there are several previous works on making decision strategies for optimal/initial parameters and on extracting similarities among instances. In our current work, we consider simplified QAOA parameters that take linear forms along with the depth in the circuit. Such a simplification, which would be suggested from an analogy to quantum annealing, leads to a drastic reduction of the parameter space from 2p to 4 dimensions with the any number of QAOA layers p. In addition, cost landscapes in the reduced parameter space have some stability on differing instances. This fact suggests that an optimal parameter set for a given instance can be transferred to other instances. In this paper we present some numerical results that are obtained for instances of the random Ising model and of the max-cut problem. The transferability of linearized parameters is demonstrated for randomly generated source and destination instances, and its dependence on features of the instances are investigated.</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walks and genuine single particle entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-particle entangled states (SPES) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-particle counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail how these protocols can be experimentally realized using single photons, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. These have unparalleled security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for matrix geometric means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix geometric means between two positive definite matrices can be defined equivalently from distinct perspectives - as solutions to certain nonlinear systems of equations, as points along geodesics in Riemannian geometry, and as solutions to certain optimisation problems. This diversity already suggests the potential for varied applications, as well as acting as a bridge between different domains. Here we devise new quantum subroutines to efficiently prepare quantum unitary operators that embed the standard matrix geometric mean and its generalisations called the weighted matrix geometric mean. This enables the construction of solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation, which is an important class of nonlinear systems of equations that appears in machine learning, optimal control, estimation, and filtering. Using these subroutines, we present a new class of quantum learning algorithms called quantum geometric mean metric learning. This has applications in efficiently finding the best distance measure and solving classification problems in the weakly supervised limit and for anomaly detection, for both classical and quantum problems. We also show how our method can be generalised to a particular p^th-order system of nonlinear equations. These quantum subroutines for matrix geometric means are also useful in other areas of quantum information. For example, we show how to use them in the estimation of geometric Renyi relative entropies and the Uhlmann fidelity by means of the Fuchs-Caves observable. In particular, our quantum algorithms for estimating the Uhlmann and Matsumoto fidelities have optimal dependence on the precision. Finally, we provide a BQP-complete problem based on matrix geometric means that can be solved by our subroutines, thus characterising their computational capability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of quantum technologies requires an increasing number of physicists, computer scientists, and engineers who can work on these technologies. For educating these professionals, quantum mechanics should stop being perceived as incomprehensible. In this paper we contribute to this change by presenting a pedagogical model for explaining Grover's search algorithm, a prominent quantum algorithm. This model visualizes the three main steps of Grover's algorithm and, in addition to explaining the algorithm itself, introduces three key principles of quantum mechanics: superposition, interference, and state collapse at measurement. The pedagogical model, visualized by a video, is called the "Ant Colony Maze model". It represents the search problems as finding the exit of a maze, and visualizes Grover's search algorithm as a strategy by which a colony of ants finds that exit.</description>

Abstract: The intersection of quantum theory and accounting presents a novel and intriguing frontier in exploring financial valuation and accounting practices. This paper applies quantum theory to cost accounting, specifically Work in Progress (WIP) valuation. WIP is conceptualized as materials in a quantum superposition state whose financial value remains uncertain until observed or measured. This work comprehensively reviews the seminal works that explored the overlap between quantum theory and accounting. The primary contribution of this work is a more nuanced understanding of the uncertainties involved, which emerges by applying quantum phenomena to model the complexities and uncertainties inherent in managerial accounting. In contrast, previous works focus more on financial accounting or general accountancy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the 'observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan "PW=CLPW". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>An Invertible All-optical Logic Gate on Chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an invertible all-optical gate on chip, with the roles of control and signal switchable by slightly adjusting their relative arrival time at the gate. It is based on quantum Zeno blockade driven by sum-frequency generation in a periodic-poled lithium niobate microring resonator. For two nearly-identical nanosecond pulses, the later arriving pulse is modulated by the earlier arriving one, resulting in 2.4 and 3.9 power extinction between the two, respectively, when their peak power is 1 mW and 2 mW. Our results, while to be improved and enriched, herald a new paradigm of logical gates and circuits for exotic applications.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Horizon: Enabling Hybrid Quantum Transfer Learning for Long-Tailed Chest X-Ray Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has the potential for improving the multi-label classification of rare, albeit critical, diseases in large-scale chest x-ray (CXR) datasets due to theoretical quantum advantages over classical machine learning (CML) in sample efficiency and generalizability. While prior literature has explored QML with CXRs, it has focused on binary classification tasks with small datasets due to limited access to quantum hardware and computationally expensive simulations. To that end, we implemented a Jax-based framework that enables the simulation of medium-sized qubit architectures with significant improvements in wall-clock time over current software offerings. We evaluated the performance of our Jax-based framework in terms of efficiency and performance for hybrid quantum transfer learning for long-tailed classification across 8, 14, and 19 disease labels using large-scale CXR datasets. The Jax-based framework resulted in up to a 58% and 95% speed-up compared to PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations, respectively. However, compared to CML, QML demonstrated slower convergence and an average AUROC of 0.70, 0.73, and 0.74 for the classification of 8, 14, and 19 CXR disease labels. In comparison, the CML models had an average AUROC of 0.77, 0.78, and 0.80 respectively. In conclusion, our work presents an accessible implementation of hybrid quantum transfer learning for long-tailed CXR classification with a computationally efficient Jax-based framework.</description>

      <title>Thawed Gaussian wavepacket dynamics with $\Delta$-machine learned potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for performing variable-width (thawed) Gaussian wavepacket (GWP) variational dynamics on machine-learned potentials is presented. Instead of fitting the potential energy surface (PES), the anharmonic correction to the global harmonic approximation (GHA) is fitted using kernel ridge regression -- this is a $\Delta$-machine learning approach. The training set consists of energy differences between ab initio electronic energies and values given by the GHA. The learned potential is subsequently used to propagate a single thawed GWP using the time-dependent variational principle to compute the autocorrelation function, which provides direct access to vibronic spectra via its Fourier transform. We applied the developed method to simulate the photoelectron spectrum of ammonia and found excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra. We show that fitting the anharmonic corrections requires a smaller training set as compared to fitting total electronic energies. We also demonstrate that our approach allows to reduce the dimensionality of the nuclear space used to scan the PES when constructing the training set. Thus, only the degrees of freedom associated with large amplitude motions need to be treated with $\Delta$-machine learning, which paves a way for reliable simulations of vibronic spectra of large floppy molecules.</description>

      <title>L0-regularized compressed sensing with Mean-field Coherent Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) is a network of optical parametric oscillators that solves combinatorial optimization problems by finding the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. As a practical application of CIM, Aonishi et al. proposed a quantum-classical hybrid system to solve optimization problems of L0-regularization-based compressed sensing (L0RBCS). Gunathilaka et al. has further enhanced the accuracy of the system. However, the computationally expensive CIM's stochastic differential equations (SDEs) limit the use of digital hardware implementations. As an alternative to Gunathilaka et al.'s CIM SDEs used previously, we propose using the mean-field CIM (MF-CIM) model, which is a physics-inspired heuristic solver without quantum noise. MF-CIM surmounts the high computational cost due to the simple nature of the differential equations (DEs). Furthermore, our results indicate that the proposed model has similar performance to physically accurate SDEs in both artificial and magnetic resonance imaging data, paving the way for implementing CIM-based L0RBCS on digital hardware such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).</description>

      <title>Direct detection of down-converted photons spontaneously produced at a single Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spontaneous photon decay into multiple photons triggered by strong non-linearities in a superconducting quantum simulator of the boundary sine-Gordon impurity model. Previously, spectroscopic signatures of photon-conversion were reported and evidenced as resonances in the many-body spectrum of these systems. Here, we report on the observation of multi-mode fluorescence of a small Josephson junction embedded in a high impedance superconducting transmission line. Measurement of the down-converted photons is achieved using state-of-the-art broadband parametric amplifiers. Photon triplet emission is explicitly demonstrated at a given frequency as the counterpart of inelastic photon decay at three-times the emission frequency. These results open exciting prospects for the burgeoning field of many-body quantum optics and offer a direct signature of the ultra-strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the phase diagram of the two-dimensional uniform electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized two-dimensional uniform electron liquids using variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) methods with Slater-Jastrow-backflow trial wave functions. Ground-state VMC and DMC energies are obtained in the density range $1 \leq r_\text{s} \leq 40$. Single-particle and many-body finite-size errors are corrected using canonical-ensemble twist-averaged boundary conditions and extrapolation of twist-averaged energies to the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size. System-size-dependent errors in Slater-Jastrow-backflow DMC energies caused by partially converged VMC energy minimization calculations are discussed. We find that, for $1 \leq r_\text{s} \leq 5$, optimizing the backflow function at each twist lowers the twist-averaged DMC energy at finite system size. However, nonsystematic system-size-dependent effects remain in the DMC energies, which can be partially removed by extrapolation from multiple finite system sizes to infinite system size. We attribute these nonsystematic effects to the close competition between fluid and defected crystal phases at different system sizes at low density. The DMC energies in the thermodynamic limit are used to parameterize a local spin density approximation correlation functional for inhomogeneous electron systems. Our zero-temperature phase diagram shows a single transition from a paramagnetic fluid to a hexagonal Wigner crystal at $r_\text{s}=35(1)$, with no region of stability for a ferromagnetic fluid.</description>

      <title>Fractional domain wall statistics in spin chains with anomalous symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of domain wall excitations in quantum spin chains. We focus on systems with finite symmetry groups represented by matrix product unitaries (MPUs), i.e. finite depth quantum circuits. Such symmetries can be anomalous, in which case gapped phases which they support must break the symmetry. The lowest lying excitations of those systems are thus domain wall excitations. We investigate the behavior of these domain walls under exchange, and find that they can exhibit non-trivial exchange statistics. This statistics is completely determined by the anomaly of the symmetry, and we provide a direct relation between the known classification of MPU symmetry actions on ground states and the domain wall statistics. Already for the simplest case of a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, we obtain that the presence of an anomalous MPU symmetry gives rise to domain wall excitations which behave neither as bosons nor as fermions, but rather exhibit fractional statistics. Finally, we show that the exchange statistics of domain walls is a physically accessible quantity, by devising explicit measurement operators through which it can be determined.</description>

      <title>Dual-frequency optical-microwave atomic clocks based on cesium atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $^{133}$Cs, which is the only stable cesium (Cs) isotope, is one of the most investigated elements in atomic spectroscopy and was used to realize the atomic clock in 1955. Among all atomic clocks, the cesium atomic clock has a special place, since the current unit of time is based on a microwave transition in the Cs atom. In addition, the long lifetime of the $6{\text{P}}_{3/2}$ state and simple preparation technique of Cs vapor cells have great relevance to quantum and atom optics experiments, which suggests the use of the $6{\text{S}} - 6{\text{P}}$ D2 transition as an optical frequency standard. In this work, using one laser as the local oscillator and Cs atoms as the quantum reference, we realized two atomic clocks in the optical and microwave frequencies, respectively. Both clocks could be freely switched or simultaneously output. The optical clock based on the vapor cell continuously operated with a frequency stability of $3.89 \times {10^{ - 13}}$ at 1 s, decreasing to $2.17 \times {10^{ - 13}}$ at 32 s, which was frequency stabilized by modulation transfer spectroscopy and estimated by an optical comb. Then, applying this stabilized laser for an optically pumped Cs beam atomic clock to reduce the laser frequency noise, we obtained a microwave clock with a frequency stability of $1.84 \times {10^{ - 12}}/\sqrt \tau $, reaching $5.99 \times {10^{ - 15}}$ at $10^5$ s. This study demonstrates an attractive feature for the commercialization and deployment of optical and microwave clocks and will guide further development of integrated atomic clocks with better stability. Thus, this study lays the groundwork for future quantum metrology and laser physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic solvers that are able to find the ground states of different spin Hamiltonians can be used to study many interactive physical systems and combinatorial optimization problems. Here, we establish a real-and-momentum space correspondence of spin Hamiltonians by spatial light transport. The real-space spin interaction is determined by modulating the momentum-space flow of light. This principle is formulated as a generalized Plancherel theorem, allowing us to implement a simple optical simulator that can find the ground states for any displacement-dependent spin interactions. Particularly, we use this principle to reveal the exotic magnetic phase diagram from a J1-J2-J3 model, and we also observe the vortex-mediated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dynamics from the XY model. These experiments exhibit high calculation precision by subtly controlling spin interactions from the momentum space of light, offering a promising scheme to explore novel physical effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite NISQ devices being severely constrained, hardware- and algorithm-aware quantum circuit mapping techniques have been developed to enable successful algorithm executions. Not so much attention has been paid to mapping and compilation implementations for spin-qubit quantum processors due to the scarce availability of experimental devices and their small sizes. However, based on their high scalability potential and their rapid progress it is timely to start exploring solutions on such devices. In this work, we discuss the unique mapping challenges of a scalable crossbar architecture with shared control and introduce SpinQ, the first native compilation framework for scalable spin-qubit architectures. At the core of SpinQ is the Integrated Strategy that addresses the unique operational constraints of the crossbar while considering compilation scalability and obtaining a O(n) computational complexity. To evaluate the performance of SpinQ on this novel architecture, we compiled a broad set of well-defined quantum circuits and performed an in-depth analysis based on multiple metrics such as gate overhead, depth overhead, and estimated success probability, which in turn allowed us to create unique mapping and architectural insights. Finally, we propose novel mapping techniques that could increase algorithm success rates on this architecture and potentially inspire further research on quantum circuit mapping for other scalable spin-qubit architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific imagination and experimental ingenuity are at the heart of physics. One of the most known instances where this interplay between theory (i.e., foundations) and experiments (i.e., technology) occurs is in the discussion of Bell's inequalities. In this paper, we present a revisitation of the violation of Bell's inequality in the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) form with entangled quantum states. First, we begin with a discussion of the 1935 Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR) paradox (i.e., incompleteness of quantum mechanics) that emerges from putting the emphasis on Einstein's locality and the absolute character of physical phenomena. Second, we discuss Bell's 1971 derivation of the 1969 CHSH form of the original 1964 Bell inequality in the context of a realistic local hidden-variable theory (RLHVT). Third, identifying the quantum-mechanical spin correlation coefficient with the RLHVT one, we follow Gisin's 1991 analysis to show that quantum mechanics violates Bell's inequality when systems are in entangled quantum states. For pedagogical purposes, we show how the extent of this violation depends both on the orientation of the polarizers and the degree of entanglement of the quantum states. Fourth, we discuss the basics of the experimental verification of Bell's inequality in an actual laboratory as presented in the original 1982 Aspect-Grangier-Roger (AGR) experiment. Finally, we provide an outline of some essential take home messages from this wonderful example of physics at its best.</description>

      <title>Qubit dephasing by spectrally diffusing quantum two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pure dephasing of a Josephson qubit due to the spectral diffusion of two-level systems that are close to resonance with the qubit. We identify the parameter regime in which this pure dephasing rate can be of the order of the energy relaxation rate and, thus, the relation $T_2 = 2 T_1$ is violated for the qubit. This regime is reached if the dynamics of the thermal TLSs responsible for the spectral diffusion is sufficiently slower than the energy relaxation of the qubit. By adding periodic bias modulating the qubit frequency or TLS excitation energies we show that this pure dephasing mechanism can be mitigated, allowing enhancement of superconducting qubits coherence time. Mitigating pure dephasing, even if it is subdominant, is of special significance in view of recent suggestions for converting the dominant relaxation process ($T_1$) into erasure errors, leaving pure dephasing as the bottleneck for efficient quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a rapidly growing field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. In this work, we examine our quantum machine learning models, which are based on quantum support vector classification (QSVC) and quantum support vector regression (QSVR). We investigate these models using a quantum-circuit simulator, both with and without noise, as well as the IonQ Harmony quantum processor. For the QSVC tasks, we use a dataset containing fraudulent credit card transactions and image datasets (the MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets); for the QSVR tasks, we use a financial dataset and a materials dataset. For the classification tasks, the performance of our QSVC models using 4 qubits of the trapped-ion quantum computer was comparable to that obtained from noiseless quantum-circuit simulations. The result is consistent with the analysis of our device-noise simulations with varying qubit-gate error rates. For the regression tasks, applying a low-rank approximation to the noisy quantum kernel, in combination with hyperparameter tuning in {\epsilon}-SVR, improved the performance of the QSVR models on the near-term quantum device. The alignment, as measured by the Frobenius inner product between the noiseless and noisy quantum kernels, can serve as an indicator of the relative prediction performance on noisy quantum devices in comparison with their ideal counterparts. Our results suggest that the quantum kernel, as described by our shallow quantum circuit, can be effectively used for both QSVC and QSVR tasks, indicating its resistance to noise and its adaptability to various datasets.</description>

      <title>Robust sparse IQP sampling in constant depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) approaches without any proof of robust quantum advantage and fully fault-tolerant quantum computation, we propose a scheme to achieve a provable superpolynomial quantum advantage (under some widely accepted complexity conjectures) that is robust to noise with minimal error correction requirements. We choose a class of sampling problems with commuting gates known as sparse IQP (Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time) circuits and we ensure its fault-tolerant implementation by introducing the tetrahelix code. This new code is obtained by merging several tetrahedral codes (3D color codes) and has the following properties: each sparse IQP gate admits a transversal implementation, and the depth of the logical circuit can be traded for its width. Combining those, we obtain a depth-1 implementation of any sparse IQP circuit up to the preparation of encoded states. This comes at the cost of a space overhead which is only polylogarithmic in the width of the original circuit. We furthermore show that the state preparation can also be performed in constant depth with a single step of feed-forward from classical computation. Our construction thus exhibits a robust superpolynomial quantum advantage for a sampling problem implemented on a constant depth circuit with a single round of measurement and feed-forward.</description>

Abstract: We investigate performing classical and quantum metrology and parameter estimation by using interacting trapped bosons, which we theoretically treat by a self-consistent many-body approach of the multiconfigurational Hartree type. Focusing on a tilted double-well geometry, we compare a self-consistently determined and monitored two-mode truncation, with dynamically changing orbitals, to the conventional two-mode approach of fixed orbitals, where only Fock space coefficients evolve in time. We demonstrate that, as a consequence, various metrological quantities associated to a concrete measurement such as the classical Fisher information and the maximum likelihood estimator are deeply affected by the orbitals' change during the quantum evolution. Self-consistency of the quantum many-body dynamics of interacting trapped ultracold gases thus fundamentally affects the attainable parameter estimation accuracy of a given metrological protocol.</description>

      <title>Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill encoding in continuous modal variables of single photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GKP states, introduced by Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill, are continuous variable logical qubits that can be corrected for errors caused by phase space displacements. Their experimental realization is challenging, in particular using propagating fields, where quantum information is encoded in the quadratures of the electromagnetic field. However, travelling photons are essential in many applications of GKP codes involving the long-distance transmission of quantum information. We introduce a new method for encoding GKP states in propagating fields using single photons, each occupying a distinct auxiliary mode given by the propagation direction. The GKP states are defined as highly correlated states described by collective continuous modes, as time and frequency. We analyze how the error detection and correction protocol scales with the total photon number and the spectral width. We show that the obtained code can be corrected for displacements in time-frequency phase space - which correspond to dephasing, or rotations, in the quadrature phase space - and to photon losses. Most importantly, we show that generating two-photon GKP states is relatively simple, and that such states are currently produced and manipulated in several photonic platforms where frequency and time-bin biphoton entangled states can be engineered.</description>

      <title>Control Requirements and Benchmarks for Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaching useful fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on successfully implementing quantum error correction (QEC). In QEC, quantum gates and measurements are performed to stabilize the computational qubits, and classical processing is used to convert the measurements into estimated logical Pauli frame updates or logical measurement results. While QEC research has concentrated on developing and evaluating QEC codes and decoding algorithms, specification and clarification of the requirements for the classical control system running QEC codes are lacking. Here, we elucidate the roles of the QEC control system, the necessity to implement low latency feed-forward quantum operations, and suggest near-term benchmarks that confront the classical bottlenecks for QEC quantum computation. These benchmarks are based on the latency between a measurement and the operation that depends on it and incorporate the different control aspects such as quantum-classical parallelization capabilities and decoding throughput. Using a dynamical system analysis, we show how the QEC control system latency performance determines the operation regime of a QEC circuit: latency divergence, where quantum calculations are unfeasible, classical-controller limited runtime, or quantum-operation limited runtime where the classical operations do not delay the quantum circuit. This analysis and the proposed benchmarks aim to allow the evaluation and development of QEC control systems toward their realization as a main component in fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the advantage of indefinite causal orders for quantum metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum switch, the canonical example of a process with indefinite causal order, has been claimed to provide various advantages over processes with definite causal orders for some particular tasks in the field of quantum metrology. In this work, we argue that some of these advantages in fact do not hold if a fairer comparison is made. To this end, we consider a framework that allows for a proper comparison between the performance, quantified by the quantum Fisher information, of different classes of indefinite causal order processes and that of causal strategies on a given metrological task. More generally, by considering the recently proposed classes of circuits with classical or quantum control of the causal order, we come up with different examples where processes with indefinite causal order offer (or not) an advantage over processes with definite causal order, qualifying the interest of indefinite causal order regarding quantum metrology. As it turns out, for a range of examples, the class of quantum circuits with quantum control of causal order, which are known to be physically realizable, is shown to provide a strict advantage over causally ordered quantum circuits as well as over the class of quantum circuits with causal superposition. Thus, the consideration of this class provides new evidence that indefinite causal order strategies can strictly outperform definite causal order strategies in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effect of Noise on the Training Performance of Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensively analyze the influence of different quantum noise gates, including Phase Flip, Bit Flip, Phase Damping, Amplitude Damping, and the Depolarizing Channel, on the performance of HyQNNs. Our results reveal distinct and significant effects on HyQNNs training and validation accuracies across different probabilities of noise. For instance, the Phase Flip gate introduces phase errors, and we observe that HyQNNs exhibit resilience at higher probability (p = 1.0), adapting effectively to consistent noise patterns, whereas at intermediate probabilities, the performance declines. Bit Flip errors, represented by the PauliX gate, impact HyQNNs in a similar way to that Phase Flip error gate. The HyQNNs, can adapt such kind of errors at maximum probability (p = 1.0). Unlike Phase and Bit Flip error gates, Phase Damping and Amplitude Damping gates disrupt quantum information, with HyQNNs demonstrating resilience at lower probabilities but facing challenges at higher probabilities. Amplitude Damping error gate, in particular, poses efficiency and accuracy issues at higher probabilities however with lowest probability (p = 0.1),it has the least effect and the HyQNNs, however not very effectively, but still tends to learn. The Depolarizing Channel proves most detrimental to HyQNNs performance, with limited or no training improvements. There was no training potential observed regardless of the probability of this noise gate. These findings underscore the critical need for advanced quantum error mitigation and resilience strategies in the design and training of HyQNNs, especially in environments prone to depolarizing noise. This paper quantitatively investigate that understanding the impact of quantum noise gates is essential for harnessing the full potential of quantum computing in practical applications.</description>

Abstract: The optimal coordination rates are determined in three primary settings of multi-user quantum networks, thus characterizing the minimal resources required in order to simulate a joint quantum state among multiple parties. We study the following models: (1) a cascade network with rate-limited entanglement, (2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers, (3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotically-achievable communication and entanglement rates in each setting. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.</description>

      <title>beSnake: A routing algorithm for scalable spin-qubit architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing devices increase in size with respect to the number of qubits, two-qubit interactions become more challenging, necessitating innovative and scalable qubit routing solutions. In this work, we introduce beSnake, a novel algorithm specifically designed to address the intricate qubit routing challenges in scalable spin-qubit architectures. Unlike traditional methods in superconducting architectures that solely rely on SWAP operations, beSnake also incorporates the shuttle operation to optimize the execution time and fidelity of quantum circuits and achieves fast computation times of the routing task itself. Employing a simple breadth-first search approach, beSnake effectively manages the restrictions created by diverse topologies and qubit positions acting as obstacles, for up to 72\% qubit density. It also has the option to adjust the level of optimization and to dynamically tackle parallelized routing tasks, all the while maintaining noise awareness. Our simulations demonstrate beSnake's advantage over an existing routing solution on random circuits and real quantum algorithms with up to $1,000$ qubits, showing an average improvement of up to $80\%$ in gate overhead and $54\%$ in depth overhead, and up to $8.33$ times faster routing times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces the Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection (QFNN-FFD), a cutting-edge framework merging Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and quantum computing with Federated Learning (FL) for financial fraud detection. Using quantum technologies' computational power and the robust data privacy protections offered by FL, QFNN-FFD emerges as a secure and efficient method for identifying fraudulent transactions within the financial sector. Implementing a dual-phase training model across distributed clients enhances data integrity and enables superior performance metrics, achieving precision rates consistently above 95%. Additionally, QFNN-FFD demonstrates exceptional resilience by maintaining an impressive 80% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and readiness for real-world applications. This combination of high performance, security, and robustness against noise positions QFNN-FFD as a transformative advancement in financial technology solutions and establishes it as a new benchmark for privacy-focused fraud detection systems. This framework facilitates the broader adoption of secure, quantum-enhanced financial services and inspires future innovations that could use QML to tackle complex challenges in other areas requiring high confidentiality and accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic ensembles strongly interacting with light constitute rich quantum-optical many-body systems, with the potential for observing cooperative effects and dissipative nonequilibrium phase transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which a driven atomic ensemble in free space, characterized by strong dipole-dipole interactions and large spatial extent, can undergo a superradiant phase transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence. In an atomic array, stationary states that conserve the collective pseudospin exhibit completely cooperative decay and undergo a second-order phase transition in the large atom number limit. In contrast, decay mechanisms on longer timescales that fail to conserve pseudospin can lead to discontinuous first-order phase transition at a critical finite atom number, disrupting cooperation despite sharing many similar observable characteristics. A hallmark of the superradiant phase transition is an abrupt shift from total light reflection off the atoms to rapidly increasing transmission, accompanied by significant quantum fluctuations, as a function of light intensity.</description>

Abstract: Learning the problem structure at multiple levels of coarseness to inform the decomposition-based hybrid quantum-classical combinatorial optimization solvers is a promising approach to scaling up variational approaches. We introduce a multilevel algorithm reinforced with the spectral graph representation learning-based accelerator to tackle large-scale graph maximum cut instances and fused with several versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and QAOA-inspired algorithms. The graph representation learning model utilizes the idea of QAOA variational parameters concentration and substantially improves the performance of QAOA. We demonstrate the potential of using multilevel QAOA and representation learning-based approaches on very large graphs by achieving high-quality solutions in a much faster time.

      <title>Identifying non-Hermitian critical points with quantum metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states is fully encoded by the quantum geometric tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the quantum geometric tensor are the quantum metric and Berry curvature, which characterize the distance and phase difference between two nearby quantum states in Hilbert space, respectively. For conventional Hermitian quantum systems, the quantum metric corresponds to the fidelity susceptibility and has already been used to specify quantum phase transitions from the geometric perspective. In this work, we extend this wisdom to the non-Hermitian systems for revealing non-Hermitian critical points. To be concrete, by employing numerical exact diagonalization and analytical methods, we calculate the quantum metric and corresponding order parameters in various non-Hermitian models, which include two non-Hermitian generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} models and non-Hermitian cluster and mixed-field Ising models. We demonstrate that the quantum metric of eigenstates in these non-Hermitian models exactly identifies the localization transitions, mobility edges, and many-body quantum phase transitions, respectively. We further show that this strategy is robust against the finite-size effect and different boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a unique phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems. However, studies on NHSE in systems without translational symmetry remain largely unexplored. Here, we unveil a new class of NHSE, dubbed "imaginary Stark skin effect" (ISSE), in a one-dimensional lossy lattice with a spatially increasing loss rate. The energy spectrum of this model exhibits a T-shaped feature, with approximately half of the eigenstates localized at the left boundary. These skin modes exhibit peculiar behaviors, expressed as a single stable exponential decay wave within the bulk region. We use the transfer matrix method to analyze the formation of the ISSE in this model. According to the eigen-decomposition of the transfer matrix, the wave function is divided into two parts, one of which dominates the behavior of the skin modes in the bulk. Our findings provide insights into the NHSE in systems without translational symmetry and contribute to the understanding of non-Hermitian systems in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory, in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure Prediction of Multi-million Atom Systems Through Uncertainty Quantification Enabled Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state electron density -- obtainable using Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) simulations -- contains a wealth of material information, making its prediction via machine learning (ML) models attractive. However, the computational expense of KS-DFT scales cubically with system size which tends to stymie training data generation, making it difficult to develop quantifiably accurate ML models that are applicable across many scales and system configurations. Here, we address this fundamental challenge by employing transfer learning to leverage the multi-scale nature of the training data, while comprehensively sampling system configurations using thermalization. Our ML models are less reliant on heuristics, and being based on Bayesian neural networks, enable uncertainty quantification. We show that our models incur significantly lower data generation costs while allowing confident -- and when verifiable, accurate -- predictions for a wide variety of bulk systems well beyond training, including systems with defects, different alloy compositions, and at unprecedented, multi-million-atom scales. Moreover, such predictions can be carried out using only modest computational resources.</description>

As a test case, we use three-dimensional topology optimization via the level-set method to optimise one-way energy transfer for point-like source and observation points. To achieve this we introduce a suite of tools, chiefly what we term the `Faraday-adjoint' method which allows for efficient shape optimization in the presence of magneto-optical media. We carry out an optimization based on a very general equation that we derive for energy transfer in a nonreciprocal medium, and link finite-different time-domain numerics to analytics via a modified Born series generalised to a tensor permittivity. This work represents a stepping stone towards practical nanophotonic optical isolation, often regarded as the `holy grail' of integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Page curves and replica wormholes from random dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to capture both the non-unitary Page curve and replica wormhole-like contributions that restore unitarity in a toy quantum system with random dynamics. The motivation is to find the simplest dynamical model that captures this aspect of gravitational physics. In our model, we evolve with an ensemble of Hamiltonians with GUE statistics within microcanonical windows. The entropy of the averaged state gives the non-unitary curve, the averaged entropy gives the unitary curve, and the difference comes from matrix index contractions in the Haar averaging that connect the density matrices in a replica wormhole-like manner.</description>

Abstract: We show that quantum fields confined to Lorentzian histories of freely falling networks in Minkowski spacetime probe entanglement properties of vacuum fluctuations that extend unrestricted across spacetime regions. Albeit instantaneous field configurations are localized on one-dimensional edges, angular momentum emerges on these network histories and establish the celebrated area scaling of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>ResQuNNs:Towards Enabling Deep Learning in Quantum Convolution Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers, significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Game Design Inspired by Quantum Physics: A Case Study on The Quantum Photo Booth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explain the conceptual development of the STAGE Lab Quantum Casino (a.k.a. the STAGE Lab Quantum Arcade), one of the Lab's most recent artistic endeavors about quantum physics. This work consists of a series of card and digital games and an interactive experience, exposing the public to quantum physics and minimizing learning barriers. Furthermore, we will also present a case study of the interactive experience, in the form of The Quantum Photo Booth.
  The STAGE Lab Quantum Casino provides an entertaining and approachable experience for people of all ages to become familiar with quantum physics. By using core concepts of quantum physics as tools and strategies to overcome challenges that arise in gameplay, players gain an intuitive understanding of these concepts. These games provide players with a first-hand experience of the following quantum physics concepts: measurement, superposition, encryption, decoherence, and entanglement. Instead of teaching the concepts through a traditional classroom pedagogy, these games aim to invoke curiosity, spark moments of playfulness, and catalyze play-centric learning modalities. This paper provides a general overview of the development of the STAGE Lab Quantum Casino, focusing on The Quantum Photo Booth experience and how science is integrated into the very nature of the game development process in addition to its outcome.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics enabled through variational interpolation of correlated electron wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Direct Experimental Constraints on the Spatial Extent of a Neutrino Wavepacket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. They also provide a unique system to study quantum coherence and the wavelike nature of particles in fundamental systems due to their extremely weak interaction probabilities. In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are virtually unknown and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude. Here, we present the first direct limits of this quantity through a new experimental concept to extract the energy width, $\sigma_{\textrm{N},E}$, of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the nuclear electron capture (EC) decay of $^7$Be. The final state in the EC decay process contains a recoiling $^7$Li nucleus and an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$) which are entangled at their creation. The $^7$Li energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding $^7$Be radioisotopes into a high resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. The lower limit on the spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter was found to be $\sigma_{\textrm{N}, x} \geq 6.2$\,pm, which implies the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first direct lower limits on the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket were extracted using two different theoretical methods. These results have wide-reaching implications in several areas including the nature of spatial localization at sub-atomic scales, interpretation of neutrino physics data, and the potential reach of future large-scale experiments.</description>
