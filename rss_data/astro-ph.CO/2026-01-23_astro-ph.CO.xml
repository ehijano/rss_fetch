      <title>The Back-in-time Void Finder: dynamical identification of cosmic voids through optimal transport reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids have increasingly emerged as a powerful cosmological probe. However, their large spatial extent and intrinsically underdense environments make their identification highly sensitive to shot noise, redshift-space distortions (RSD), and observational systematics, particularly for topological and density-based void definitions. We introduce the Back-In-Time Void Finder (BitVF), a novel dynamical and physically motivated algorithm that identifies cosmic voids as regions of negative divergence of the Lagrangian displacement field reconstructed from the present-day tracer distribution. The reconstruction relies on an optimized discrete optimal transport algorithm that recovers the backward-in-time dynamics of tracers, naturally accounting for tracer bias without relying on cosmological assumptions. We validate BitVF against the widely used topological void finder REVOLVER using high-resolution N-body simulations, showing that it produces void catalogs with smoother and more physically motivated density profiles, as well as abundances that are more stable under tracer subsampling and shot noise. We further apply it to realistic DESI-like mock light-cone galaxy catalogs, demonstrating that it intrinsically mitigates redshift-space systematic effects, preserving real-space void size functions more faithfully than topological methods. Modeling RSD, the reconstruction can be combined with a fiducial cosmology and an assumed tracer bias within a bias-corrected Kaiser framework, yielding reconstructed-space void catalogs consistent with real-space statistics across redshift. Its performance is characterized as a function of the main internal parameters, showing an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and applicability to stage IV galaxy surveys. BitVF will be publicly released within the CosmoBolognaLib.</description>

      <title>Constraining nonminimal f(T) gravity from Primordial Nucleosynthesis to Late-Universe observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-epoch test of f(T) gravity with nonminimal torsion-matter coupling, combining early- and late-Universe observations. At the MeV scale, Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis constrains the fractional variation of the weak freeze-out temperature, |{\delta}{\tau}_f/{\tau}_f|, thereby mapping light-element abundances into limits on deviations from the standard expansion history. At low redshift, we confront the model with type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic-chronometer data, which respectively probe distances, the late-time standard ruler, and the Hubble rate. Independent analyses highlight the complementary roles of each dataset, while a joint SNe Ia + BAO + CC fit breaks degeneracies and yields the tightest combined bounds. As an illustration, we examine two representative torsion-modified gravity scenarios: BBN strongly limits large departures from standard cosmology, whereas late-time probes remain compatible with a near-{\Lambda}CDM background. This unified approach demonstrates the power of linking early-Universe nuclear physics with precision cosmological observables in assessing torsional extensions of gravity.</description>

      <title>Two Fluid Quantum Bouncing Cosmology I: Theoretical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmologies offer an alternative to inflation by resolving the initial
  singularity through a contracting phase followed by a bounce into expansion. In many
  such models, the contracting phase is dominated by a single matter component,
  typically pressureless dust, which leads to an almost scale-invariant spectrum of
  scalar cosmological perturbations with a slight blue tilt, so that generating the
  observed red-tilted spectrum within this framework was challenging. In this work, we
  consider a more realistic scenario in which the contracting phase includes both
  matter and radiation, as required on physical grounds. We show that the presence of
  radiation can naturally induce a red tilt in the spectrum of curvature perturbations
  seeded by quantum vacuum fluctuations in the remote past of the contraction. Since
  the perturbations of the two fluids are coupled via gravity, vacuum initial
  conditions must be carefully defined. We demonstrate that, without fine-tuning, the
  resulting entropy perturbations are subdominant with respect to curvature
  perturbations. This suggests that a minimal two-component bounce model, involving
  only ordinary matter and radiation, can connect to the standard expanding cosmology
  with observationally viable initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter soliton core hosting a supermassive black hole as a dense low-mass perturber in strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution imaging observations of strong lens systems reveal dense low-mass perturbers. We propose a soliton core, whose central density is boosted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH), in the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model as an efficient perturber in strong gravitational lensing. The higher central density makes it less efficient in the tidal mass loss, and leads to the higher impact in gravitational lensing. We show that the mass profile of a $\sim 10^6M_\odot$ perturber in JVAS B1938+666, which does not resemble any known astronomical object, can be wel explained by a soliton core in the FDM model with the mass of $4\times 10^{-21}$eV hosting an SMBH with the mass of $4\times 10^5M_\odot$. The high mass of the SMBH may be explained by several scenarios that predcit heavy SMBH seeds such as the direct collapse black hole formation and primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Redshift-Binned Constraints on the Hubble Constant under $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and Pad\'e Cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent claims of a possible redshift dependence in late-Universe determinations of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), we test the robustness of this behaviour using multiple cosmological probes. We perform a joint redshift-binned analysis of $H_0$ across eight bins using late-Universe probes -- Pantheon+ SNe~Ia, DESI BAO, cosmic chronometers, and water megamasers -- under three cosmological frameworks: flat $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and Pad\'e cosmography. Under a common baseline scheme, all three models show a qualitatively similar, low-amplitude variation in the per-bin $H_0$ estimates. A simple Fourier-like parametrization captures this behaviour, but the amplitude differs from zero only at a marginal significance of about $1.71$--$1.94\,\sigma$, with similar behaviour observed across all three cosmological frameworks. We then investigate the robustness and possible origin of this feature. Alternative binning schemes preserve its qualitative form, whereas single-probe per-bin fits (SNe-only, CC-only, BAO-only) yield ratios $H_{0,i}/H_{0,\mathrm{global}}$ mostly consistent with unity and do not reproduce the pronounced drift seen in the joint baseline constraints. Finally, by comparing different global versus piecewise-constant configurations for $\{H_0,\Omega_m,M,r_d\}$, we find that a baseline-like oscillatory pattern re-emerges only when multiple degenerate parameter combinations are allowed to vary across bins, while it is strongly suppressed when only $H_0$ is bin-dependent. Taken together, these results indicate that the apparent oscillatory behaviour of $H_0(z)$ in late-time arises from known parameter degeneracies and does not constitute robust evidence for a genuine redshift evolution.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic alignments in the FLAMINGO simulations with two-point statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic alignments are a major astrophysical contaminant for next generation large-sky surveys like Euclid and LSST. Large hydrodynamic simulations are crucial for informing the alignment modelling for these surveys. We measure position-position and position-shape correlations of a Luminous Red Galaxy sample from the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, measuring the alignment signal for more than 4.9 million galaxies at redshift 0. We jointly model the clustering and alignment correlations to provide the tightest constraints on the alignment amplitude to date from a hydrodynamic simulation. We find that both the Non-Linear Alignment (NLA) and the more complex Tidal Alignment Tidal Torquing (TATT) models provide good fits to the data. We compare the measured $A_1$ amplitude to observational data and find good agreement. We measure the dependence of the NLA and TATT free parameters on halo mass. We also introduce a mass-dependent TATT model, TATT-M, by finding empirical relations between the halo mass and the TATT parameters. This allows us to fit TATT with only one parameter, $A_1$, with $A_2/A_1$ being a constant and $A_{1\delta}/A_1$ being a function of halo mass. Using a Bayesian approach, we find that TATT-M is very strongly preferred by the data over NLA. Using the baryonic feedback variations of the FLAMINGO simulation suite, we test whether the TATT parameters are sensitive to feedback. Variations in AGN and supernova feedback do not significantly change the alignment amplitude beyond the change associated with the dependence of galaxy stellar mass on the strength of feedback. Our results inform the IA modelling for upcoming surveys by providing guidance on model choices, priors and sensitivities to feedback.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Analyses with Digital Twins of the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect provides a powerful probe of the thermal pressure of ionised gas in galaxy clusters and the cosmic web; constrained simulations reconstruct the mass and velocity fields of the local Universe. We explore how these two may be mutually informative: the tSZ signal provides a benchmark for assessing the fidelity of constrained simulations, and constrained simulations contribute information on the positions, total masses and density profiles of cosmic web structures for use in tSZ studies. We focus on cluster predictions in the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) paradigm, introducing CSiBORG-Manticore, a new state-of-the-art suite of digital twins -- data-constrained posterior simulations whose initial conditions are inferred via Bayesian forward modelling. We develop a framework for scoring constrained simulations on their ability to match measured Compton-$y$ maps from Planck for cluster cutouts, and use it to demonstrate improvement from previous BORG reconstructions. We further validate halo masses against weak-lensing-calibrated X-ray masses from eROSITA. We also show how high-fidelity digital twins offer a practical route to extracting additional information from tSZ data through a novel calibration of the mass-observable relation, and provide a complementary framework to purely statistical analyses of Compton-$y$ maps. This paves the way for integrating the large-scale structure information inherent in constrained simulations into the study of CMB secondary anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 4. Percent-Level Cosmological Constraints from Combined Probes and Robust Evidence for the Normal Neutrino Mass Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present cosmological parameters measurements from the full combination of DESI DR1 galaxy clustering data described with large-scale structure effective field theory. By incorporating additional datasets (photometric galaxies and CMB lensing cross-correlations) and extending the bispectrum likelihood to smaller scales using a consistent one-loop theory computation, we achieve substantial gains in constraining power relative to previous analyses. Combining with the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data and using cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors on the power spectrum tilt and baryon density, we obtain tight constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model, finding the Hubble constant $H_0=69.08\pm 0.37~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the matter density fraction $\Omega_m=0.2973\pm 0.0050$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.815\pm 0.016$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.811\pm 0.016$), corresponding to $0.6\%$, $1.7\%$, and $2\%$ precision respectively. Adding the Pantheon+ supernova sample (SNe), we find a preference of $2.6\sigma$ for the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model from low-redshift data alone, which increases to $2.8\sigma$ when exchanging the SNe with Planck CMB data. Combining full-shape data with BAO, CMB, and SNe likelihoods, we improve the dark energy figure-of-merit by $18\%$ and bound the sum of the neutrino masses to $M_\nu&lt;0.057$ eV in $\Lambda$CDM and $M_\nu&lt;0.095$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model (both at 95\% CL). This represents an improvement of $25\%$ over the background expansion constraints and the strongest bound on neutrino masses in $w_0w_a$CDM to date. Our results suggest that the preference for the normal ordering of neutrino mass states holds regardless of the cosmological background model, and is robust in light of tensions between cosmological datasets.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark energy models using Jackknife and Bootstrap resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of type Ia supernovae have helped us shed light on the existence and nature of dark energy. Most of these analyses have relied on Bayesian techniques. In this work, we rely on resampling techniques to analyse supernova data. In particular, we use the generalised least squares method together with Jackknife and Bootstrap techniques to estimate parameters of $\Lambda$CDM, flat $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, flat $w$CDM, and flat $w_0\,w_a$CDM models from the recent PantheonPlus and SH0ES data. For completeness, we also perform Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling algorithms, and compare the results. We note that resampling techniques can help highlight the limitations of the data. For instance, we see that the Jackknife method estimates a strong positive correlation between $h$ and $M$ and higher standard deviations for both. This may have significant implications for the Hubble tension. We conclude with a discussion of our results.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes produced by Dark Meta Stable Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by string theory and cosmological constant problem, it is plausible that the Universe's vacuum structure is characterized by a landscape of metastable vacua. The existence of dark matter and dark energy further suggests that the dark sector may inhabit its own "dark landscape". If the dark vacuum is metastable, bubbles of lower-energy phases can nucleate at an approximately constant rate. Because the Hubble expansion rate is monotonically non-increasing with cosmic time, such nucleation can eventually lead to percolation and completion of a dark-sector phase transition. In this work, we investigate the phenomenological consequences of this transition, focusing on the resulting stochastic gravitational-wave background and the potential formation of primordial black holes. We find that the gravitational wave spectrum peaks at $k_{\mathrm{peak}}=3.1 H_{\mathrm{PT}}$, with an amplitude $\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}^{\mathrm{peak}}\simeq1.5 \Omega_\gamma(\Delta\rho/\rho_{\mathrm{tot}})^2$. Furthermore, the formation of primordial black holes is suppressed due to $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ constraint.</description>

      <title>Single-wave solutions of the neutrino fast flavor system. Part I. Mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dense neutrino plasma can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by neutrino--neutrino refraction. Recently, a new class of exact nonlinear inhomogeneous solutions was discovered: single-wave (SW) solutions of the fast flavor system. The key property is that the flavor occupation numbers remain homogeneous, whereas the field of flavor coherence varies spatially with a single wave vector. The equations of motion for this structure resemble those of a collection of classical spins, in analogy with the homogeneous slow and fast flavor cases. In contrast, the SW system is not integrable (it does not possess Gaudin invariants) so that, while two-beam pendulum solutions are inevitable, they do not extend to a multi-angle system. We develop a taxonomy of all known nonlinear collective flavor solutions, explaining the overlap between categories and their differences.</description>

      <title>Radio-Interferometric Image Reconstruction with Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing images of the radio sky from incomplete Fourier information is a key challenge in radio astronomy. In this work, we present a method for radio interferometeic image reconstruction using a data-driven prior for the radio sky based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). We first train a DDPM on radio galaxy observations from the VLA FIRST survey. We create simulated VLA, EHT, and ALMA observations of radio galaxies, then use an unsupervised posterior sampling method called Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) to reconstruct the corresponding images, using our DDPM as a prior. Our approach is agnostic to the measured radio interferometric data and naturally incorporates the physics of the measurement process. We are able to reconstruct images with very high fidelity PSNR&gt;60, a marked improvement over CLEAN and similar image reconstruction methods using conditional DDPMs</description>

Abstract: JADES Data Release 5 (DR5) photometric catalogs and describes the methodologies used for source detection, deblending, photometry, uncertainty estimation, and catalog curation. The catalogs are constructed from 35 space-based imaging mosaics obtained with JWST/NIRCam, JWST/MIRI, HST/ACS, and HST/WFC3, combining approximately 1250 hours of JADES imaging with extensive additional public JWST and HST observations in the GOODS fields. Sources are identified using custom signal-to-noise-based detection and deblending algorithms optimized for the depth, resolution, and complex point-spread-function structure of JWST imaging. Source centroids, shapes, and photometric apertures are determined using a new fast two-dimensional Gaussian regression method applied to detection-image profiles. We provide forced circular-aperture photometry, ellipsoidal Kron photometry, and curve-of-growth measurements for every source in every band. We introduce a new pixel-level regression framework to model photometric uncertainties as a function of aperture size and local mosaic properties, accounting for correlated noise in heterogeneous JWST mosaics. Photometric redshifts are computed using template-based fitting applied to both small-aperture photometry on unconvolved images and Kron photometry on common-PSF mosaics. The JADES DR5 catalogs supersede previous JADES photometric releases, and are publicly released through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes and an interactive web interface.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Spectral Morphological Division of Fast Radio Bursts with CHIME/FRB Catalog 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are commonly divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating sources, but whether these represent distinct physical populations remains uncertain. In this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning methods combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with density-based clustering to analyze CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We find that FRBs remain primarily separated into two clusters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with a recall of 0.94 for known repeaters, indicating strong robustness. Consistent with Catalog 1 analyses, we confirm that the spectral morphology parameter, specifically spectral running remains the key discriminator between the two populations, indicating that narrowband emission is an intrinsic and persistent property of repeating FRBs. With the enlarged Catalog 2 sample, we further identify a stable subclass of atypical repeaters (about $6\%$ of repeating bursts) that are broadband, shorter in duration, and more luminous, resembling non-repeating bursts. The Nonrepeater-like cluster also shows higher inferred energies and dispersion measures, consistent with a scenario in which apparently non-repeating FRBs may result from observational incompleteness, with low-energy repeating bursts remaining undetected. Our results provide new statistical evidence for a physical connection between repeating and non-repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>The FarView Low Frequency Radio Array on the Moon's Far Side: Science and Array Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FarView is a proposed low frequency radio interferometer for deployment on the lunar far side, enabled by the Moon's radio quiet environment. Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.</description>

      <title>Different effects of the Lorentz and Gaussian bump functions on the formation of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar perturbations in the inflation can be amplified when the base inflation potential $V_b(\phi)$ incorporates a local bump $f(\phi)$ such as $V(\phi)=V_b(\phi)(1+f(\phi))$. This modification will lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum, increasing a significant abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs). However, since there is no underlying physical reason for the choice of $f(\phi)$, it is essential to investigate the effects of various bump functions on PBH generation. In this paper, we choose the well-known Starobinsky potential as the base inflation potential to compare the effects produced by different bumps, specifically focusing on the Lorentz and Gaussian bumps which are widely used. To clearly illustrate the differences between these two bumps, we keep parameters in bump functions the same. We find an interesting and novel result that the Lorentz cases manifest a stronger ability to enhance the power spectrum and produce more abundance of PBHs than Gaussian cases. Moreover, we also investigate the different effects of bump functions on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). The results indicate that the Lorentz bump generates SIGWs with a higher energy density, which can be potentially detected in the future. Our study gives valuable insights into the choice and constraints on the bump functions, and the different effects may distinguish the two bump cases for practical purposes in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Running the small-correlated-against-large estimator at scale: Applications of small-scale CMB lensing estimators on realistic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Small-Correlated-Against-Large Estimator (SCALE) for small-scale lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a novel method for measuring the amplitude of CMB lensing power without the need for reconstruction of the lensing field. In our previous study, we showed that the SCALE method can outperform existing reconstruction methods to detect the presence of lensing at small scales ($\ell \gg 3000$). Here we develop a procedure to include information from SCALE in cosmological parameter inference. We construct a precise neural network emulator to quickly map cosmological parameters to desired CMB observables such as temperature and lensing power spectra and SCALE cross spectra. We also outline a method to apply SCALE to full-sky maps of the CMB temperature field, and construct a likelihood for the application of SCALE in parameter estimation. SCALE supplements conventional observables such as the CMB power spectra and baryon acoustic oscillations in constraining parameters that are sensitive to the small-scale lensing amplitude such as the neutrino mass $m_\nu$. We show that including estimates of the small-scale lensing amplitude from SCALE in such an analysis provides enough constraining information to measure the minimum neutrino mass at $4\sigma$ significance in the scenario of minimal mass, and higher significance for higher mass. Finally, we show that SCALE will play a powerful role in constraining models of clustering that generate scale-dependent modulation to the distribution of matter and the lensing power spectrum, as predicted by models of warm or fuzzy dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmic acceleration and the Hubble tension from baryon acoustic oscillation data</title>

Abstract: We investigate the null tests of cosmic accelerated expansion by using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and reconstruct the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$ from the DESI BAO Alcock-Paczynski (AP) data using Gaussian process to perform the null test. We find strong evidence of accelerated expansion from the DESI BAO AP data. By reconstructing the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ from the DESI BAO AP data, we find that accelerated expansion persisted until $z \lesssim 0.7$ with a 99.7\% confidence level. Additionally, to provide insights into the Hubble tension problem, we propose combining the reconstructed $E(z)$ with $D_H/r_d$ data to derive the model-independent result $r_d h=99.8\pm 3.1$ Mpc. This result is consistent with measurements from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies using the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also propose a model-independent method for reconstructing the comoving angular diameter distance $D_M(z)$ from the distance modulus $\mu$ using SNe Ia data and combining this result with DESI BAO data of $D_M/r_d$ to constrain the value of $r_d$. We find that the value of $r_d$ derived from this model-independent method is smaller than that obtained from CMB measurements, with a significant discrepancy of at least 4.17$\sigma$. All the conclusions drawn in this paper are independent of cosmological models and gravitational theories.</description>

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ = 0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended for GAMA-like surveys (i &lt; 19.2) at z &lt; 0.1 where minimal model dependence is required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates across diverse catalogues with limits of z &lt; 0.3. These calibrated estimators will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and parsimonious quantification of baryonic feedback on matter distribution is of crucial importance for understanding both cosmology and galaxy formation from observational data. This is, however, challenging given the large discrepancy among different models of galaxy formation simulations, and their distinct subgrid physics parameterizations. Using 5,072 simulations from 4 different models covering broad ranges in their parameter spaces, we find a unified 2D latent representation. Compared to the simulations and other phenomenological models, our representation is independent of both time and cosmology, much lower-dimensional, and disentangled in its impacts on the matter power spectra. The common latent space facilitates the comparison of parameter spaces of different models and is readily interpretable by correlation with each. The two latent dimensions provide a complementary representation of baryonic effects, linking black hole and supernova feedback to distinct and interpretable impacts on both the matter power spectrum, and field, level. Our approach enables developing robust and economical analytic models for optimal gain of physical information from data, and is generalizable to other fields with significant modeling uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved matched filter method for detecting large ionized regions in 21 cm observations of the Epoch of Reionization. In addition to detection, the method constrains the properties of these regions, offering insights into the underlying source populations. Extending a previously developed Bayesian framework, we replace the spherical filter with an eight-parameter spheroidal filter, enabling a more flexible characterization of ionized bubbles. This enhancement significantly improves both detectability and recovery of bubble orientations. For a representative reionization scenario with mean ionization fraction $0.4$ at $z=7$, we find that a $10\sigma$ detection of the largest ionized region can be achieved with $\sim 1$ h of observations using the SKA-low AA4 and AA$^{\star}$ layouts. Our method can help identify regions in the observed field that host large ionized bubbles, making them prime targets for deeper follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>STRAWBERRY: Finding haloes in the gravitational potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present a novel algorithm that discriminates between bound and unbound particles by consideration of the gravitational potential from an accelerated reference frame -- also referred to as `the boosted potential'. Particles are considered bound if their energy does not exceed the escape energy of a potential well -- given by the closest saddle-point that connects to a deeper potential minimum. This approach has core benefits over previous approaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as over-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles in the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding checks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler than approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically become bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound and unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their distribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and their redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to understand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound, virialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the other component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave equation of motion includes direct coupling to the Riemann tensor. The curvature terms are usually neglected, but they can be large at the location of matter particles and impact the angular diameter distance. We apply the recently introduced post-geometrical optics approximation that includes curvature to gravitational wave propagation. Assuming that particles are localised within their Compton wavelength, the curvature due to electrons leads to a large effect on the angular diameter distance, but caustic formation invalidates the post-geometrical optics approximation. We conclude that the interesting regime of validity of the approximation is limited, as it ceases to apply when the curvature effects become large. Other methods are needed to evaluate the effect of curvature spikes, and the localisation of particles due to decoherence also needs further work.</description>

      <title>The choice of Planck CMB likelihood in cosmological analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare cosmological parameters from different Planck sky maps and likelihood pipelines, assessing robustness of cosmological results with respect to the choice of the latest Planck maps-likelihood combination. We show that, for the Planck multipole range retained in combination with ground-based observations, different products give very similar cosmological solutions; small remaining differences are reduced by the addition of other CMB datasets to Planck. In particular, constraints on extended cosmological models benefit from the addition of small-scale power from ground-based experiments and are completely insensitive to the choice of Planck maps and likelihood. For this work we derive and release a nuisance-marginalized dataset and CamSpec-NPIPE-lite likelihood for the Planck NPIPE data injected into the CamSpec likelihood - which are usually used to obtain the reference Planck PR4 cosmology. Using the extracted CMB spectra we show that the additional constraining power for cosmology is coming from polarization at all scales and from temperature at multipoles above 1500 when going from PR3 to PR4. We also show that full marginalization over the CamSpec foreground nuisance parameters can impact parameter inference and model selections when truncating some scales; our new likelihood enables correct combinations with other CMB datasets.</description>

      <title>Hidden pattern of self-invariant cosmic expansion: Empirical evidence from Hubble diagram of supernovae</title>

Abstract: We present empirical evidence extracted directly from the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa demonstrating that the speed of light varies as the universe expands. Moreover, the speed of light must vary in a specific quantifiable manner. To show this, we reformulate the kinematics of late-time acceleration using Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=(t/t_0)^\mu$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_0a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying c along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. The new model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa and exhibits a strong degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates a self-invariant cosmic evolution: at all instants during the late-time epoch, the speed of light is exactly proportional to the rate of cosmic expansion, viz. $c=\mu^{-1}c_0t_0\,da/dt$, a characteristic that is absent in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This synchronous behavior between $c$ and $da/dt$ carries profound cosmological implications that we will discuss, regarding (i) the nature of late-time acceleration; (ii) a resolution to the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalized cosmological principle into the time domain; and (v) a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology. This newfound kinematic $c\propto da/dt$ relation represents a stringent requirement that any viable dynamical model of cosmology must satisfy, a requirement that the $\Lambda$CDM model does not fulfill. Thus, our paper delivers the clearest and most decisive evidence to date that challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of cosmology and calls for variable-$c$ modifications to General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Constraining electromagnetic couplings of ultralight scalars from compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If an ultralight scalar interacts with the electromagnetic fields of a compact rotating star, then a long-range scalar field is developed outside the star. The Coulomb-like profile of the scalar field to the leading order is equivalent to an effective scalar charge on the star. In a binary star system, the scalar-induced charge would result in a long-range force between the stars, with the scalar field acting as the mediator. The scalar-photon interactions would modify Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields in vacuum, resulting in a modified dispersion relation. This could be observed as an apparent redshift for photons emitted by such sources. The scalar field would also induce additional electric and magnetic fields and hence affect the electromagnetic energy radiated from such compact objects. A scalar field sourced by time-varying electromagnetic fields can also carry away energy from a compact star in the form of radiation, and hence contribute to its spin-down luminosity. We constrain the scalar-photon coupling from the measurements of the electromagnetic radiation of a compact star and from its spin-down luminosity, using the Crab pulsar, the soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20, and the gamma ray burst GRB 080905A. We also project the prospective bounds on the coupling from future measurements of the long-range force between two compact stars in a binary such as PSR J0737-3039, and from the apparent redshifts of compact stars. Future advances in precision-clock sensitivity and targeted observations of stars with strong surface magnetic fields, large radii, and low-frequency emission can substantially tighten these coupling limits.</description>

      <title>Turbulent dynamos in a collapsing cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amplification of magnetic fields is crucial for understanding the observed magnetization of stars and galaxies. Turbulent dynamo is the primary mechanism responsible for that but the understanding of its action in a collapsing environment is still rudimentary and relies on limited numerical experiments. We develop an analytical framework and perform numerical simulations to investigate the behavior of small-scale and large-scale dynamos in a collapsing turbulent cloud. This approach is also applicable to expanding environments and facilitates the application of standard dynamo theory to evolving systems. Using a supercomoving formulation of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we demonstrate that dynamo action in a collapsing background leads to a super-exponential growth of magnetic fields in time, significantly faster than the exponential growth seen in stationary turbulence. The enhancement is mainly due to the increasing eddy turnover rate during the collapse, which boosts the instantaneous growth rate of the dynamo. We also show that the scaling of final saturated magnetic field strength with density robustly exceeds the expectation from considerations of pure flux-freezing. Apart from establishing a formal framework for studying magnetic field evolution in collapsing (or expanding) turbulent plasmas, these findings suggest that during star and galaxy formation magnetic fields can become dynamically relevant much earlier than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Probing the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic centre with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gigaelectronvolt $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic centre remains unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading explanation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars remains viable. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by interstellar scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge in the future.
  We constructed synthetic populations of detached millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Still, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\sim$0.9 M$_\odot$), though part of this contrast reflects our modelling assumptions. LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Thus, identifying millisecond-pulsar binaries among the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, as their gravitational-wave signals alone are indistinguishable. However, coordinated follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array of LISA-selected targets could directly test the millisecond-pulsar explanation of the $\gamma$-ray excess.</description>

      <title>Maximal GW amplitude from bubble collisions in supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend analytic formulas for the gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum from first-order phase transitions to include cosmic expansion under the thin-wall and envelope approximations. We demonstrate that even for strongly supercooled transitions the GW amplitude is bounded from above. This conclusion is explicitly verified for several representative nucleation histories, including delta-function, power-law, and power-exponential types. Moreover, the spectral shape, amplitude, and peak frequency remain largely unaffected by the details of the nucleation rate once expressed in terms of the conformal variables evaluated at an appropriately defined characteristic collision time.</description>

      <title>AGN spectral variability across activity states and searches for axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic, energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the properties of the intervening magnetic fields.
  Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity.
  In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array analysis in a Legendre polynomial basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Legendre polynomials, previously employed in this context by Lee et al. [1], van Haasteren and Levin [2], and Pitrou and Cusin [3], to model signals in pulsar timing arrays (PTA). These replace the (Fourier mode) basis of trigonometric functions normally used for data analysis. The Legendre basis makes it simpler to incorporate pulsar modeling effects, which remove constant-, linear-, and quadratic-in-time terms from pulsar timing residuals. In the Legendre basis, this zeroes the amplitudes of the the first three Legendre polynomials. We use this basis to construct an optimal quadratic cross-correlation estimator $\widehat{\mu}$ of the Hellings and Downs (HD) correlation and compute its variance $\sigma^2_{\widehat{\mu}}$ in the way described by Allen and Romano [4]. Remarkably, if the gravitational-wave background (GWB) and pulsar noise power spectra are (sums of) power laws in frequency, then in this basis one obtains analytic closed forms for many quantities of interest.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Pulsar Distance Inference from Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are limited in localizing nanohertz continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) by uncertainties in pulsar distances. We introduce a method to infer pulsar distances in two dimensions, using phase information from the pulsar terms of multiple CGW sources. Our approach can enhance distance precision and, in some cases, achieve order-of-magnitude improvements relative to existing one-dimensional distance-inference methods. Using simulations of an SKA-era PTA with realistic parallax-based distance priors, we demonstrate that pulsars at $\sim 1$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision with only a few CGW sources. Such improvements in pulsar-distance precision have important implications for CGW host-galaxy identification and multimessenger observational prospects.</description>
