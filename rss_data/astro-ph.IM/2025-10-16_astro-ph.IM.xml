      <title>Diffusion models for polarimetric reconstruction of circumstellar environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12853v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach combining diffusion models and inverse problems for the reconstruction of circumstellar disk images. Our method builds upon the Rhapsodie framework for polarimetric imaging, substituting its classical prior with a diffusion model trained on synthetic data. Our formulation explicitly incorporates stellar leakage while efficiently handling missing data and high level noise inherent to high-contrast polarimetric imaging. Experiments show significant improvement over conventional methods within our framework of assumptions, opening new perspectives for studying circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Time-dependent Karhunen-Loeve Phase Screens: an Ergodic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent phase screens in ground-based astronomy are typically simulated in the so-called frozen-screen approximation by establishing a static phase screen on a large pupil and dragging an aperture equivalent to the size of the actual input pupil across this oversized phase screen. The speed of this motion sweeping through the large phase screen is equivalent to a wind speed that changes the phase screen as a function of time.
  The ergodic ansatz replaces this concept by constructing the structure function in a three-dimensional volume -- a sphere for reasons of computational efficiency -- , sampling phase screens by two-dimensional planar cuts through that volume, and dragging them along the surface normal at some speed which generates a video of a phase screen.
  This manuscript addresses the linear algebra of populating the three-dimensional volume with phase screens of the von-Karman model of atmospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>InferA: A Smart Assistant for Cosmological Ensemble Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing large-scale scientific datasets presents substantial challenges due to their sheer volume, structural complexity, and the need for specialized domain knowledge. Automation tools, such as PandasAI, typically require full data ingestion and lack context of the full data structure, making them impractical as intelligent data analysis assistants for datasets at the terabyte scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose InferA, a multi-agent system that leverages large language models to enable scalable and efficient scientific data analysis. At the core of the architecture is a supervisor agent that orchestrates a team of specialized agents responsible for distinct phases of the data retrieval and analysis. The system engages interactively with users to elicit their analytical intent and confirm query objectives, ensuring alignment between user goals and system actions. To demonstrate the framework's usability, we evaluate the system using ensemble runs from the HACC cosmology simulation which comprises several terabytes.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the ComPair Balloon Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ComPair, the prototype of the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO) mission concept, is a combined Compton imager and pair production telescope. It consists of four subsystems: a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) Tracker, a virtual Frisch-grid cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) Low Energy Calorimeter, a cesium iodide (CsI) High Energy Calorimeter, and a plastic scintillator Anti-Coincidence Detector (ACD) to reject the charged particle background. These subsystems work together to reconstruct events, by tracking the locations and energies of gamma-ray scatters and pair production events. To quantify ComPair's scientific capabilities prior to a balloon launch in 2023, calibrations were performed to benchmark the instrument's performance in terms of angular resolution, energy resolution, and effective area. In this paper we provide an overview of the ComPair instrument and detail the calibration campaign. Finally, we compare our results to the expected performance based on simulations.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Turning Off the Bright Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric surveys require precise point spread function (PSF) characterization, as it varies across filters and is crucial for accurate photometry and low surface brightness (LSB) studies. However, the small PSF size provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making it difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions unusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each exposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4 arcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF exhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed. Additionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the filters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no significant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time (within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212 (which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We developed a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated stars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror reflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining different stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a fixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial measurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction improves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about 10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys like J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be customized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even greater due to its depth. This paper is fully reproducible and produced from Commit 4860c70.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Pretraining and Domain Adaptation for Astronomical Time Series with Minimal Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical time-series analysis faces a critical limitation: the scarcity of labeled observational data. We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</description>

      <title>Toward First-Principles Multi-Messenger Predictions: Coupling Nuclear Networks with GR Radiation-MHD in {\tt Gmunu}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of nuclear reaction networks in the \texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical (\texttt{Gmunu}) code, a framework for general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD). The extended code self-consistently evolves nuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's equations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source terms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is performed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a tabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic tests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia supernovae. These tests confirm accurate coupling between nuclear reactions and fluid dynamics, conserving electron and nuclear mass fractions to machine precision.
  As an application, we conduct spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova simulations. The models reproduce the expected non-exploding behavior of standard progenitors, while enhanced neutrino heating revives the shock. Including nuclear burning modifies the post-shock composition and dynamics, converting silicon and oxygen layers into iron-group nuclei and strengthening the explosion. This demonstrates the impact of explosive burning on ejecta composition and shock evolution, and establishes the stability of the coupled GR radiation-MHD-nuclear framework. The implementation is fully compatible with multidimensional GRMHD simulations and represents the first GRRMHD code combining M1 neutrino transport with fully coupled nuclear burning.</description>

      <title>Improved Absolute Polarization Calibrator for BICEP CMB Polarimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic birefringence is a hypothesized parity violation in electromagnetism that predicts a frequency-independent polarization rotation as light propagates. This would rotate the light from the Cosmic Microwave Background, producing an unexpected EB correlation. However, cosmic birefringence angle is degenerate with instrument polarization angle, and breaking this degeneracy requires an absolute polarization calibration. We calibrate the BICEP3 telescope (a 95GHz CMB polarimeter) by observing a rotating polarized source (RPS) with both the telescope and a small test receiver called the In-Situ Absolute Angle Calibrator (ISAAC).</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of Kernel Phase Interferometry on JWST/MIRI: Prospects for Future Planet Searches Around Post Main Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel phase interferometry (KPI) is a post-processing technique that treats a conventional telescope as an interferometer by accurately modeling a telescope pupil as an array of virtual subapertures. KPI provides angular resolution within the diffraction limit by eliminating instrumental phase errors to first order. It has been successfully demonstrated to boost angular resolution on both space- and ground-based observatories, and is especially useful for enhancing space telescopes, as their diameters are smaller than the largest ground-based facilities. Here we present the first demonstration of KPI on JWST/MIRI data at 7.7 microns, 10 microns, and 15 microns. We generate contrast curves for 16 white dwarfs from the MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey, finding significantly deeper contrast at small angular separations compared to traditional imaging with JWST/MIRI, down to within $\lambda$/D. Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four known companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows that at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space where inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to exist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white dwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in post-main-sequence exoplanets.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Aperture Masking Interferometric Imaging: Demonstration with the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for aperture masking interferometric (AMI) imaging at near-IR wavelengths using radio astronomical techniques. The method starts with derivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the interferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using self-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains (i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking interferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8~$\mu$m and 3.8~$\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration, near-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based amplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source calibration star. We employ early science observations of the dusty binary Wolf-Rayet star WR137. Images with a dynamic range (peak/rms) of $\sim 240$ on the target, and $\sim 1000$ on the calibrator, are synthesized from a short integration. The self-calibration process determines the photon path-lengths through the optical system to each aperture using data on the target source itself, thereby representing an essentially 'real-time', precise wavefront error sensor. Four independent measures of the JWST mirror segment pistons (two wavelengths for two sources), agree to within 10~nm to 15~nm, comparable to the expected errors based on an analysis of closure phases on the calibrator star. Including a baseline-based phase correction improves the dynamic range of the final images by about 23\%.</description>

      <title>Design of an Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope array layout with differential programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current optimization of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes arrays, also called Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays, relies on brute-force human-driven approaches based on large simulations requiring both high amount of storage and long computation time. To explore the full phase space of telescope positioning of a given array even more simulations would be required. To optimize any array layout, we explore the possibility of developing a differential program with surrogate models of IACT arrays based on high-level instrument response functions (IRFs). The simulation time of a single telescope to a cosmic-ray event can be significantly reduced with its instrument response function or with generative models. However, it is not straight forward to model the array of telescopes from a set of single telescope surrogate models as the array is a stereoscopic imaging system. The complexity increases as well if the telescopes in the array are of different types. Additionally, the optimum of the array layout depends on the scientific use case. Current array layout optimization are obtained by minimizing the sensitivity of the array, a metric that depends on several high-level parameters such as the trigger efficiency, the energy and angular resolution, as well as the background rejection capability. The variety of telescopes types in IACT arrays, such as in the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), not only extends the sensitive energy range but also allows for cross-calibration of the instruments. Therefore, the optimal array layout is not only which minimizes sensitivity but also which reduces the systematic uncertainties. We focus on the optimization of a telescope array based on the SST-1M IACTs in Hanle, Ladakh India aiming at building a generic optimization pipeline for future ground-based cosmic-ray observatories</description>

      <title>Eccentric Disks With Self-Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can a disk orbiting a central body be eccentric, when the disk feels its own self-gravity and is pressureless? Contradictory answers appear in the literature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a sharply truncated edge: the surface density $\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge, and the $\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it vanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out of the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An edge where $\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed for astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by Hunter &amp; Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in three ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by solving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion relation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB. As a byproduct, we show that softening the self-gravitational potential is not needed to model a flat disk, and we develop a softening-free algorithm to model the disk's Laplace-Lagrange-like equations. The algorithm is easy to implement and is more accurate than softening-based methods at a given resolution by many orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic and planetary dust hold vital clues to the chemical evolution of the solar system, yet in situ analysis of their molecular and elemental composition remains technically challenging. Here we present laboratory results from HANKA (High-resolution mass Analyzer for Nano-scale Kinetic Astro materials), a compact Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer developed towards the goal of a universal dust detector for space applications. Using infrared laser ablation and plasma formation under vacuum, we analyzed solid-state samples representative of Lunar, Martian, and Meteoritic material. The resulting mass spectra - recorded at resolving powers of R=60000 - reveal complex, but characteristic element mixtures. These results demonstrate the single event sensitivity of HANKA, and its mass resolution with the ability to resolve complex mass spectra and possibly differentiate geochemical signatures across planetary bodies. The dynamic range of 3-4 orders of magnitude enables even the detection of trace compounds. The minimalistic impact sampling approach enables fast, high-precision compositional mass analysis without complex sample preparation, making the instrument well-suited for orbital, surface, or flyby missions with expected dust impacts. Our system consists of an IR-laser system that simulates impacts of nano to micron sized solid-state dust and ice particles from space. It therefore allows to perform so called analogue experiments in the laboratory. We conclude that IR- laser pulses on a solid-state material are not only well suited for ice particle impact analogues but also a good analogue experiment for solid state particle impacts on a dust detector electrode in space. Moreover, the IR laser is employed only for an optimal analogue experiment simulating the impact event - it is not necessary in space on a spacecraft detecting space dust.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the Crossing of Comet 3I/ATLAS's Ion Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During October - November 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, will pass upstream of the Europa Clipper and Hera spacecraft. Here, we identify two potential opportunities for in-situ observations of 3I's ion tail by immersion, facilitated by the close alignment between the comet's hyperbolic trajectory with the ecliptic plane. During the period 30 October - 6 November 2025, it is predicted that Europa Clipper will potentially be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS, providing the opportunity to detect the signatures of an interstellar comet's ion tail. Characteristic changes to the solar wind are also expected to be observed; a magnetic draping structure associated with the comet may be identifiable. It is further predicted that spacecraft Hera will possibly be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS during the period 25 October - 1 November 2025.</description>

      <title>APRIL: Auxiliary Physically-Redundant Information in Loss - A physics-informed framework for parameter estimation with a gravitational-wave case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, the total mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ of the binary. In this controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Supernova Classification with Interpretable Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is critical for cosmological studies but remains difficult due to class imbalance and observational noise. While deep learning models have been explored, they are often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets. We emphasize the use of PR-AUC and F1-score as more informative metrics than ROC-AUC in severely imbalanced settings. Using an XGBoost ensemble optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we classified light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC), comprising 21,318 events with a 3.19 imbalance ratio (non-Ia to Ia). Our model achieved a PR-AUC of $0.993^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, an F1-score of $0.923 \pm 0.008$, and a ROC-AUC of $0.976 \pm 0.004$, matching or exceeding deep learning performance on precision-recall trade-offs while using fewer resources. Despite slightly lower overall accuracy, our method balances false positives and false negatives, improving the efficiency of spectroscopic follow-up. We show that optimized ensemble models offer a reproducible and lightweight alternative to complex architectures, particularly for large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) where transparency and efficiency are essential.</description>

      <title>The Online Data Filter for the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KM3NeT research infrastructure comprises two neutrino telescopes located in the deep waters of the Mediterranean Sea, namely ORCA and ARCA. KM3NeT/ORCA is designed for the measurement of neutrino properties and KM3NeT/ARCA for the detection of high-energy neutrinos from the cosmos. Neutrinos are indirectly detected using three-dimensional arrays of photo-sensors which detect the Cherenkov light that is produced when relativistic charged particles emerge from a neutrino interaction. The analogue pulses from the photo-sensors are digitised offshore and all digital data are sent to a station on shore where they are processed in real time using a farm of commodity servers and custom software. In this paper, the design and performance of the software that is used to filter the data are presented. The performance of the data filter is evaluated in terms of its efficiency, purity and capacity. The efficiency is measured by the effective volumes of the sensor arrays as a function of the energy of the neutrino. The purity is measured by a comparison of the event rate caused by muons produced by cosmic ray interactions in the Earth's atmosphere with the event rate caused by the background from decays of radioactive elements in the sea water and bioluminescence. The capacity is measured by the minimal number of servers that is needed to sustain the rate of incoming data. The results of these evaluations comply with all specifications. The count rates of all photo-sensors are measured with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz. These data are input to the simulations of the detector response and will also be made available for interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <title>The evolution of PUCHEROS from a basic to a competitive tool for stellar astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PUCHEROS +, a new spectrograph developed as an enhanced version of PUCHEROS (Pontificia Universidad Catolica High Echelle Resolution Optical Spectrograph), which was the first high-resolution spectrograph built at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (UC). With respect to its predecessor, PUCHEROS + includes a substantial number of improvements, mainly: a new scientific detector, improved objective optics, calibration system, guiding, active thermal control, and remote observing mode. These upgrades convert our early prototype into a much more powerful instrument for science. With a spectral resolution of R = 18000, a spectral range between 400 and 730 nm and an instrument efficiency of about 30 per cent, PUCHEROS + was tested at the ESO (European Southern Observatory) 1.52-m telescope where it has reached a limiting magnitude of about 12 in V band and radial velocity precision of about 30 m/s. The instrument was conceived as a pathfinder for the high-resolution echelle spectrograph PLATOSpec and at the same time, it demonstrates that a compact, relatively low-cost spectrograph can be efficiently employed for long-term monitoring campaigns and as support facility for space missions, in particular if operated remotely at relatively small- or medium-sized telescopes.</description>

      <title>Advancing Interstellar Science: A Global Framework for Comprehensive Study of Interstellar Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) marks a transformative moment in humanity's capacity to detect and characterize interstellar objects (ISOs). With projections indicating an increase from a few detections per decade to potentially one every few months, humanity stands at the threshold of unprecedented scientific opportunity offering revolutionary insights into the nature of rocky materials, building blocks of life and technological products from other star systems. This white paper proposes the establishment of the United Nations Committee on Interstellar Objects (UNCIO), a specialized body designed to coordinate global scientific research, maximize observational coverage, and ensure optimal scientific return from these extraordinary objects from outside the solar system through systematic investigation in cosmochemistry, astrobiology, planetary sciences, fundamental physics, advanced technologies and materials science. The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in our current international infrastructure: the absence of coordinated detection, classification and intercept capabilities, insufficient protocols for rapid scientific response and international policy decisions to time-sensitive observations, and the need for effective science communication to maintain government and public support for these ambitious investigations and global threats to Earth. Drawing from successful international collaborations in areas such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), UNCIO would operate through a dual structure: an executive board for time-critical scientific decisions and an expanded committee for comprehensive stakeholder representation. This initiative is not merely aspirational but urgently practical.</description>

      <title>Introducing The SHell misAlignment Detection for straylight Estimation (SHADE) algorithm: the case of XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When performing X-ray observations with a Wolter-I telescope, the presence of bright off-axis sources can introduce unfocused rays, known as straylight, which contaminate the detector and compromise the scientific analysis. Among the different components of straylight, single reflections off the hyperboloid section of the mirror shells often produce arc-like patterns on the detector. These arcs depend not only on the off-axis angle of the source but also on the geometrical alignment of the individual shells. In this paper, we introduce the SHell misAlignment Detection for straylight Estimation (SHADE) algorithm, a novel and flexible tool designed to infer the misalignment parameters of individual shells, reproduce the geometry of straylight arcs and predict its pattern on the detector. SHADE allows us to model each shell displacement with two parameters: $(\gamma,\xi)$ that represents the tilt amplitude and direction. While the algorithm is general and applicable to any Wolter-like telescope, we demonstrate its effectiveness using a set of XMM-Newton observations of the low-mass X-ray binary GX5-1. As a proof of concept, we recover the best-fit misalignment parameters for a selected shell, obtaining $\gamma = 21.9''^{+10.3}_{-9.02}$ and $\xi = 5.88^{+1.02}_{-0.97}$ rad. SHADE represents a new approach to diagnosing mirror misalignments from straylight patterns and can support both pre and post-launch calibration efforts and future telescope designs.</description>

      <title>Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations. As largely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis into the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be technological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest' resolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches surprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\lesssim 0.005$\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity. The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\sim{5.9} \times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.</description>

Abstract: Europa's surface composition and physical characteristics are commonly constrained using spectral deconvolution through linear mixture (LM) modeling and radiative transfer-based (RT) intimate mixture modeling. Here, I compared the results of these two spectral modeling- LM versus RT- against laboratory spectra of water (H$_{2}$O) ice and sulfuric acid octahydrate (SAO; H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O) mixtures measured at near-infrared wavelengths ($\sim$1.2-2.5 $\mu$m) with grain sizes of 90-106 $\mu$m (Hayes and Li, 2025). The modeled abundances indicate that the RT more closely reproduces the laboratory abundances, with deviations within $\pm$5% for both H$_{2}$O ice and H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O with $\sim$100 $\mu$m grains. In contrast, the LM shows slightly larger discrepancies, typically ranging from $\pm$5-15% from the true abundances. Interestingly, both LM and RT tend to consistently overestimate the abundance of H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O and underestimate H$_{2}$O ice across all mixtures. Nonetheless, when H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$$\cdot$8H$_{2}$O either dominates (&gt;80% as observed on Europa's trailing hemisphere; Carlson et al. 2005) or is present only in trace amounts ($\sim$10% on areas in Europa's leading hemisphere; Dalton III et al. 2013; Ligier et al. 2016), both the LM and RT render acceptable results within $\pm$10% uncertainty. Thus, spectral modeling using the RT is preferred for constraining the surface composition across Europa, although the LM remains viable in specific compositional regimes.</description>
