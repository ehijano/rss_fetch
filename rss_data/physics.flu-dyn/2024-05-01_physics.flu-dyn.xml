      <title>Definition of vortex boundary using stagnation pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method is proposed to identify vortex boundary and center of rotation based on tubular surfaces of constant stagnation pressure and minimum of the stagnation pressure gradient. The method is derived from Crocco's theorem, which ensures that the gradient of stagnation pressure is orthogonal to both the velocity and vorticity vectors. The method is Galilean invariant, requires little processing and is robust. It enables visualization of complex turbulent flows and provides a physically consistent definition of vortex boundaries for quantitative analyses. This vortex boundary is a material surface that is representative of the kinematics of the flow by construction, constitutes a vortex tube, ensures conservation of circulation in the inviscid limit and provides a unique relation to the conservation of momentum equations and vortex loads.</description>

      <title>A High-Fidelity Methodology for Particle-Resolved Direct Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel computational method for direct numerical simulations of particle-laden flows with fully-resolved particles (PR-DNS). The method is based on the recently developed Volume-Filtering Immersed Boundary method [Dave et al, Journal of Computational Physics, 487:112136, 2023] derived by volume-filtering the transport equations. This approach is mathematically and physically rigorous, in contrast to other PR-DNS methods which rely on ad-hoc numerical schemes to impose no-slip boundary conditions on the surface of particles. With the present PR-DNS strategy, we show that the ratio of filter size to particle diameter acts as a parameter that controls the level of fidelity. In the limit where this ratio is very small, a well-resolved PR-DNS is obtained. Conversely, when the ratio of filter size to particle diameter is large, a classic point-particle method is obtained. The discretization of the filtered equations is discussed and compared to other PR-DNS strategies based on direct-forcing immersed boundary methods. Numerical examples with sedimenting resolved particles are discussed.</description>

      <title>Improved pressure-gradient sensor for the prediction of separation onset in RANS models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve upon two key aspects of the Menter shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model: (1) We propose a more robust adverse pressure gradient sensor based on the strength of the pressure gradient in the direction of the local mean flow; (2) We propose two alternative eddy viscosity models to be used in the adverse pressure gradient regions identified by our sensor. Direct numerical simulations of the Boeing Gaussian bump are used to identify the terms in the baseline SST model that need correction, and a posteriori Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes calculations are used to calibrate coefficient values, leading to a model that is both physics driven and data informed. The two sensor-equipped models are applied to two thick airfoils representative of modern wind turbine applications, the FFA-W3-301 and the DU00-W-212, with maximum thicknesses of 30% and 20% of their chord lengths, respectively. While the baseline SST model predicts stall (onset of separation) $3^\circ$ to $5^\circ$ late for all cases considered, the proposed models predict stall within the margins of experimental uncertainty, which greatly improves the prediction of the maximum lift generated. For the FFA airfoil, the models also improve the prediction of the linear region of the lift curve likely due to their improved prediction of a pressure-side separation at low angles of attack. The models are shown to generalize well across the two airfoil geometries (despite their difference in thickness) and across almost a factor of 10 in variations in chord-based Reynolds numbers from $1.6\times10^6$ to $1.5\times10^7$.</description>

      <title>Bounds to the Basset-Boussinesq force on particle laden stratified flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Basset-Boussinesq force is often perfunctory neglected when studying small inertial particles in turbulence. The force results from the diffusion of vorticity from the particles, and as it depends on the particles past history, it complicates the dynamics by turning their equations of motion into integro-differential equations. However, this force is of the same order as other viscous forces acting on the particles, and beyond convenience, the reasons for neglecting it are unclear. We derive strict bounds for the magnitude of the Basset-Boussinesq force in stably stratified flows, in contexts of interest for geophysical turbulence. The bounds are validated by direct numerical simulations. The Basset-Boussinesq force can be neglected when a buoyancy Stokes number $\textrm{Sb} = N \tau_p$ is small, where $N$ is the flow Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency and $\tau_p$ is the particles Stokes time. For sufficiently strong stratification, or particles with large inertia, this force must be considered in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Influence of the downstream blade sweep on cross-flow turbine performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-flow turbine blades encounter a relatively undisturbed inflow for the first half of each rotational cycle ("upstream sweep") and then pass through their own wake for the latter half ("downstream sweep"). While most research on cross-flow turbine optimization focuses on the power-generating upstream sweep, we use singled-bladed turbine experiments to show that the downstream sweep strongly affects time-averaged performance. We find that power generation from the upstream sweep continues to increase beyond the optimal tip-speed ratio. In contrast, the power consumption from the downstream sweep begins to increase approximately linearly beyond the optimal tip-speed ratio due in part to an increasingly unfavorable orientation of lift and drag relative to the rotation direction as well as high tangential blade velocities. Downstream power degradation increases faster than upstream power generation, indicating the downstream sweep strongly influences the optimal tip-speed ratio. In addition, particle image velocimetry data is obtained inside the turbine swept area at three tip-speed ratios. This illuminates the mechanisms underpinning the observed performance degradation in the downstream sweep and motivates an analytical model for a limited case with high induction. Performance results are shown to be consistent across 55 unique combinations of chord-to-radius ratio, preset pitch angle, and Reynolds number, underscoring the general relevance of the downstream sweep.</description>

      <title>The influence of non-Newtonian behaviors of blood on the hemodynamics past a bileaflet mechanical heart valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs extensive three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) to investigate the influence of blood non-Newtonian behaviors on the hemodynamics around a bileaflet mechanical heart valve under both steady inflow and physiologically realistic pulsatile flow conditions. Under steady inflow conditions, the study reveals that blood rheology impacts velocity and pressure field variations, as well as the values of clinically important surface and time-averaged parameters like wall shear stress (WSS) and pressure recovery. Notably, this influence is most pronounced at low Reynolds numbers, gradually diminishing as the Reynolds number increases. For instance, surface-averaged WSS values obtained with the non-Newtonian shear-thinning power-law model exceed those obtained with the Newtonian model. At $Re = 750$, this difference reaches around 67\%, reducing to less than 1\% at $Re = 5000$. Correspondingly, pressure recovery downstream of the valve leaflets is lower for the shear-thinning blood than the constant viscosity one, with the difference decreasing as the Reynolds number increases. On the other hand, in pulsatile flow conditions, jets formed between the leaflets and the valve housing wall are shorter than steady inflow conditions. Additionally, surface-averaged wall shear stress and blood damage (BD) parameter values are higher (with differences more than 13\% and 47\%, respectively) during the peak stage of the cardiac cycle, especially for blood exhibiting non-Newtonian yield stress characteristics compared to the shear-thinning or constant viscosity characteristics. Therefore, blood non-Newtonian behaviors, including shear-thinning and yield stress behaviors, exert a considerable influence on the hemodynamics around a mechanical heart valve.</description>

      <title>Short term vs. long term: optimization of microswimmer navigation on different time horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use reinforcement learning to find strategies that allow microswimmers in turbulence to avoid regions of large strain. This question is motivated by the hypothesis that swimming microorganisms tend to avoid such regions to minimise the risk of predation. We ask which local cues a microswimmer must measure to efficiently avoid such straining regions. We find that it can succeed without directional information, merely by measuring the magnitude of the local strain. However, the swimmer avoids straining regions more efficiently if it can measure the sign of local strain gradients. We compare our results with those of an earlier study [Mousavi et al. arxiv:2309.09641] where a short-time expansion was used to find optimal strategies. We find that the short-time strategies work well in some cases but not in others. We derive a new theory that explains when the time-horizon matters for our optimisation problem, and when it does not. We find the strategy with best performance when the time-horizon coincides with the correlation time of the turbulent fluctuations. We also explain how the update frequency (the frequency at which the swimmer updates its state) affects the found strategies. We find that higher update frequencies yield better performance, as long as the time between updates is smaller than the correlation time of the flow.</description>

      <title>Enduring two-dimensional perturbations with significant non-modal growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laminar shear flows can display large non-modal perturbation growth, often through the lift-up mechansm, and can undergo subcritical transition to turbulence. The process is three-dimensional. Two-dimensional (2D) spanwise-independent perturbations are often considered less important as they typically undergo modest levels of transient growth and are short-lived. Strikingly, we show the existence of 2D non-modal perturbations that get amplified significantly and survive for long periods of time. Two-layer and three-layer viscosity stratified plane shear flows are taken to be the mean states. We show that while the two-layer flow is always modally stable, the three-layer flow supports exponential growing instabilities only when the middle layer is the least viscous. The non-modal stability analysis is performed only for the modally stable configurations of these flows. At later times, the non-modal perturbations feature strongly confined vortical structures near the interface in the two-layer flow. For the three-layer flow, similar observations are noted when all the three layers have different shear rates with the vortices prominently seen in the vicinity of the interface between the least viscous and middle layers. For the three-layer flow configuration with the outer layers having equal shear rates, the perturbation structure shows symmetry about the middle layer and evolves such that the Orr mechanism can repeatedly occur in a regenerative manner resulting in the perturbation energy evolving in a markedly non-monotonic fashion. When these same perturbations are introduced in a uniform plane shear flow, the extent of non-modal transient growth is shown to be significantly smaller.</description>

      <title>Stabilized POD Reduced Order Models for convection-dominated incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative computational study of two stabilized Reduced Order Models (ROMs) for the simulation of convection-dominated incompressible flow (Reynolds number of the order of a few thousands). Representative solutions in the parameter space, which includes either time only or time and Reynolds number, are computed with a Finite Volume method and used to generate a reduced basis via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations onto the reduced space is used to compute the ROM solution. To ensure computational efficiency, the number of POD modes is truncated and ROM solution accuracy is recovered through two stabilization methods: i) adding a global constant artificial viscosity to the reduced dimensional model, and ii) adding a different value of artificial viscosity for the different POD modes. We test the stabilized ROMs for fluid flow in an idealized medical device consisting of a conical convergent, a narrow throat, and a sudden expansion. Both stabilization methods significantly improve the ROM solution accuracy over a standard (non-stabilized) POD-Galerkin model.</description>

      <title>Inverse Modeling of Bubble Size Dynamics for Interphase Mass Transfer and Gas Holdup in CO2 Bubble Column Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of microbial gas fermentation for transforming captured CO2 into sustainable fuels and chemicals has been identified as a promising decarbonization pathway. To accelerate the scale-up of gaseous CO2 fermentation reactors, computational models need to predict gas-to-liquid mass transfer which requires capturing the bubble size dynamics, i.e. bubble breakup and coalescence. In this work, an inverse modeling approach is used to calibrate the breakup and coalescence closure models, that are used in the Multiple-Size-Group (MUSIG) population balance modeling (PBM). The calibration aims at replicating experimental results obtained in a CO2-air-water-coflowing bubble column reactor. Bayesian inference is used to account for noise in the experimental dataset and bias in the simulation results. The estimated simulation bias also allows identifying the best-performing closure models irrespective of the model parameters used. The calibration results suggest that the breakage rate is underestimated by one order of magnitude in two different breakup modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of particle aggregation in dewetting films of complex liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamic wetting and dewetting processes of films and droplets of complex liquids on planar surfaces, focusing on the case of colloidal suspensions, where the particle interactions can be sufficiently attractive to cause agglomeration of the colloids within the film. This leads to an interesting array of dynamic behaviours within the liquid and of the liquid-air interface. Incorporating concepts from thermodynamics and using the thin-film approximation, we construct a model consisting of a pair of coupled partial differential equations that represent the evolution of the liquid film and the effective colloidal height profiles. We determine the relevant phase behaviour of the uniform system, including finding associated binodal and spinodal curves, helping to uncover how the emerging behaviour depends on the particle interactions. Performing a linear stability analysis of our system enables us to identify parameter regimes where agglomerates form, which we independently confirm through numerical simulations and continuation of steady states, to construct bifurcation diagrams. We obtain various dynamics such as uniform colloidal profiles in an unstable situation evolving into agglomerates and thus elucidate the interplay between dewetting and particle aggregation in complex liquids on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Decoder Decomposition for the Analysis of the Latent Space of Nonlinear Autoencoders With Wind-Tunnel Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are chaotic and multi-scale dynamical systems, which have large numbers of degrees of freedom. Turbulent flows, however, can be modelled with a smaller number of degrees of freedom when using the appropriate coordinate system, which is the goal of dimensionality reduction via nonlinear autoencoders. Autoencoders are expressive tools, but they are difficult to interpret. The goal of this paper is to propose a method to aid the interpretability of autoencoders. This is the decoder decomposition. First, we propose the decoder decomposition, which is a post-processing method to connect the latent variables to the coherent structures of flows. Second, we apply the decoder decomposition to analyse the latent space of synthetic data of a two-dimensional unsteady wake past a cylinder. We find that the dimension of latent space has a significant impact on the interpretability of autoencoders. We identify the physical and spurious latent variables. Third, we apply the decoder decomposition to the latent space of wind-tunnel experimental data of a three-dimensional turbulent wake past a bluff body. We show that the reconstruction error is a function of both the latent space dimension and the decoder size, which are correlated. Finally, we apply the decoder decomposition to rank and select latent variables based on the coherent structures that they represent. This is useful to filter unwanted or spurious latent variables, or to pinpoint specific coherent structures of interest. The ability to rank and select latent variables will help users design and interpret nonlinear autoencoders.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Fluctuations in Viscoelastic Stress: A Comparison of the Temporary Network and Dumbbell models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, stress fluctuations in flowing and deformed materials are overlooked, with an obvious focus on average stresses in a continuum mechanical approximation. However, these fluctuations, often dismissed as noise, hold the potential to provide direct insights into the material structure and its structure-stress coupling, uncovering detailed aspects of fluid transport and relaxation behaviors. Despite advancements in experimental techniques allowing for the visualization of these fluctuations, their significance remains largely untapped, as modeling efforts continue to target Newtonian fluids within the confines of Gaussian noise assumptions. In the present work a comparative analysis of stress fluctuations in two distinct microstructural models is carried out: the temporary network model and the dumbbell model. Despite both models conforming to the Upper Convected Maxwell Model at a macroscopic level, the temporary network model predicts non-Gaussian fluctuations. We find that stress fluctuations within the temporary network model exhibit more pronounced abruptness at local scale, with only an enlargement of the control volume leading to a gradual Gaussian-like noise, diminishing the differences between the two models. These findings underscore the heightened sensitivity of fluctuating rheology to microstructural details and the microstructure-flow coupling, beyond what is captured by macroscopically averaged stresses.</description>

      <title>A fast-running physics-based wake model for a semi-infinite wind farm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new generation of fast-running physics-based models to predict the wake of a semi-infinite wind farm, extending infinitely in the lateral direction but with finite size in the streamwise direction. The assumption of a semi-infinite wind farm enables concurrent solving of the laterally-averaged momentum equations in both streamwise and spanwise directions. The developed model captures important physical phenomena such as vertical top-down transport of energy into the farm, variable wake recovery rate due to the farm-generated turbulence, and also wake deflection due to turbine yaw misalignment and Coriolis force. Of special note is the model's capability to predict and shed light on the counteracting effect of Coriolis force causing wake deflections in both positive and negative directions. Moreover, the impact of wind-farm layout configuration on the flow distribution is modelled through a parameter called the local deficit coefficient. Model predictions were validated against large-eddy simulations extending up to 45 kilometres downstream of wind farms. Detailed analyses were performed to study the impacts of various factors such as incoming turbulence, wind-farm size, inter-turbine spacing, and wind-farm layout on the farm wake.</description>

      <title>A variational data assimilation approach for sparse velocity reference data in coarse RANS simulations through a corrective forcing term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations provide a computationally efficient method for solving fluid flow problems in engineering applications. However, the use of closure models to represent turbulence effects can reduce their accuracy. To address this issue, recent research has explored data-driven techniques such as data assimilation and machine learning.
  An efficient variational data assimilation (DA) approach is presented to enhance steady-state eddy viscosity based RANS simulations. To account for model deficiencies, a corrective force term is introduced in the momentum equation. In the case of only velocity reference data, this term can be represented by a potential field and is divergence-free. The DA implementation relies on the discrete adjoint method and approximations for efficient gradient evaluation.
  The implementation is based on a two-dimensional coupled RANS solver in OpenFOAM, which is extended to allow the computation of the adjoint velocity and pressure as well as the adjoint gradient. A gradient-based optimizer is used to minimize the difference between the simulation results and the reference data. To evaluate this approach, it is compared with alternative data assimilation methods for canonical stationary two-dimensional turbulent flow problems. For the data assimilation, sparsely distributed reference data from averaged high-fidelity simulation results are used.
  The results suggest that the proposed method achieves the optimization goal more efficiently compared to applying data assimilation for obtaining the eddy viscosity, or a field modifying the eddy viscosity, directly. The method works well for different reference data configurations and runs efficiently by leveraging coarse meshes.</description>

      <title>A mesh-free framework for high-order simulations of viscoelastic flows in complex geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate and stable simulation of viscoelastic flows remains a significant computational challenge, exacerbated for flows in non-trivial and practical geometries. Here we present a new high-order meshless approach with variable resolution for the solution of viscoelastic flows across a range of Weissenberg numbers. Based on the Local Anisotropic Basis Function Method (LABFM) of King et al. J. Comput. Phys. 415 (2020):109549, highly accurate viscoelastic flow solutions are found using Oldroyd B and PPT models for a range of two dimensional problems - including Kolmogorov flow, planar Poiseulle flow, and flow in a representative porous media geometry. Convergence rates up to 9th order are shown. Three treatments for the conformation tensor evolution are investigated for use in this new high-order meshless context (direct integration, Cholesky decomposition, and log-conformation), with log-conformation providing consistently stable solutions across test cases, and direct integration yielding better accuracy for simpler unidirectional flows. The final test considers symmetry breaking in the porous media flow at moderate Weissenberg number, as a precursor to a future study of fully 3D high-fidelity simulations of elastic flow instabilities in complex geometries. The results herein demonstrate the potential of a viscoelastic flow solver that is both high-order (for accuracy) and meshless (for straightforward discretisation of non-trivial geometries including variable resolution). In the near-term, extension of this approach to three dimensional solutions promises to yield important insights into a range of viscoelastic flow problems, and especially the fundamental challenge of understanding elastic instabilities in practical settings.</description>

      <title>A Novel Paradigm in Solving Multiscale Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05067v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale phenomena manifest across various scientific domains, presenting a ubiquitous challenge in accurately and effectively simulating multiscale dynamics in complex systems. In this paper, a novel decoupling solving paradigm is proposed through modelling large-scale dynamics independently and treating small-scale dynamics as a slaved system. A Spectral Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) is developed to characterize the small-scale system in an efficient and accurate way, addressing the challenges posed by the representation of multiscale dynamics in neural networks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments, including one-dimensional Kuramot-Sivashinsky equation, two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, showcasing its versatility in addressing problems of fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we also delve into the application of the proposed approach to more complex problems, including non-uniform meshes, complex geometries, large-scale data with noise, and high-dimensional small-scale dynamics. The discussions about these scenarios contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the method's capabilities and limitations. By enabling the acquisition of large-scale data with minimal computational demands, coupled with the efficient and accurate characterization of small-scale dynamics via Spectral PINN, our approach offers a valuable and promising approach for researchers seeking to tackle multiscale phenomena effectively.</description>

      <title>Is a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of Navier-Stokes equations with small enough grid spacing and time-step definitely reliable/correct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, results given by the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of Navier-Stokes equations are widely regarded as reliable benchmark solutions of turbulence, as long as grid spacing is fine enough (i.e. less than the minimum Kolmogorov scale) and time-step is small enough, say, satisfying the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. Is this really true? In this paper a two-dimensional sustained turbulent Kolmogorov flow is investigated numerically by the two numerical methods with detailed comparisons: one is the traditional `direct numerical simulation' (DNS), the other is the `clean numerical simulation' (CNS). The results given by DNS are a kind of mixture of the false numerical noise and the true physical solution, which however are mostly at the same order of magnitude due to the butterfly-effect of chaos. On the contrary, the false numerical noise of the results given by CNS is much smaller than the true physical solution of turbulence in a long enough interval of time so that a CNS result is very close to the true physical solution and thus can be used as a benchmark solution. It is found that numerical noise as a kind of artificial tiny disturbances can lead to huge deviations at large scale on the two-dimensional Kolmogorov turbulence, not only quantitatively (even in statistics) but also qualitatively (such as symmetry of flow). Thus, fine enough spatial grid spacing with small enough time-step alone cannot guarantee the validity of the DNS: it is only a necessary condition but not sufficient. This finding might challenge some assumptions in investigation of turbulence. So, DNS results of a few sustained turbulent flows might have huge deviations on both of small and large scales from the true solution of Navier-Stokes equations even in statistics. Hopefully, CNS as a new tool to investigate turbulent flows more accurately than DNS could bring us some new discoveries.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of energy transfer in strongly driven rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A short, abrupt increase in energy injection rate into steady strongly-driven rotating turbulent flow is used as a probe for energy transfer in the system. The injected excessive energy is localized in time and space and its spectra differ from those of the steady turbulent flow. This allows measuring energy transfer rates, in three different domains: In real space, the injected energy propagates within the turbulent field, as a wave packet of inertial waves. In the frequency domain, energy is transferred non-locally to the low, quasi-geostrophic modes. In wavenumber space, energy locally cascades toward small wavenumbers, in a rate that is consistent with two-dimensionsal (2D) turbulence models. Surprisingly however, the inverse cascade of energy is mediated by inertial waves that propagate within the flow with small, but non-vanishing frequency. Our observations differ from measurements and theoretical predictions of weakly driven turbulence. Yet, they show that in strongly-driven rotating turbulence, inertial waves play an important role in energy transfer, even at the vicinity of the 2D manifold.</description>

      <title>A Two-Phase Model of Early Atherosclerotic Plaque Development with LDL Toxicity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease in which fatty plaque is built inside an artery wall. Early atherosclerotic plaque development is typically characterised by inflammatory tissues primarily consisting of foam cells and macrophages. We present a multiphase model that explores early plaque growth to emphasise the role of cytokines (in particular, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) and oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in monocyte recruitment and foam cell production, respectively. The plaque boundary is assumed to move at the same speed as the inflammatory tissues close to the periphery. This study discusses oxLDL-induced toxic environment towards macrophages and foam cells such that they start to die beyond a threshold limit of oxLDL concentration owing to excessive consumption. Our findings reveal that initially, the plaque evolves rapidly, and the growth rate subsequently reduces because of oxLDL-induced toxicity. In addition, it is observed that the saturation of inflammatory cell volume fraction becomes independent of oxLDL concentration beyond the threshold limit, referred to as the oxLDL toxicity limit. Our study manifests that increased oxLDL flux promotes flattened plaque growth through oxLDL-induced toxicity, while elevated cytokines flux disrupts the corresponding flattened behaviour. Detailed analysis of the model presented in this article unfolds critical insights into the various biochemical and cellular mechanisms behind early plaque development.</description>

      <title>Universal Physics Transformers: A Framework For Efficiently Scaling Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers (UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles. UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tunable transport in bi-disperse porous materials with vascular structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transport in synthetic, bi-disperse porous structures, with arrays of microchannels interconnected by a nanoporous layer. These structures are inspired by the xylem tissue in vascular plants, in which sap water travels from the roots to the leaves to maintain hydration and carry micronutrients. We experimentally evaluate transport in three conditions: high pressure-driven flow, spontaneous imbibition, and transpiration-driven flow. The latter case resembles the situation in a living plant, where bulk liquid water is transported upwards in a metastable state (negative pressure), driven by evaporation in the leaves; here we report stable, transpiration-driven flows down to $\sim -15$ MPa of driving force. By varying the shape of the microchannels, we show that we can tune the rate of these transport processes in a predictable manner, using a simple analytical (effective medium) approach and numerical simulations of the flow field in the bi-disperse media. We also show that the spontaneous imbibition behavior of a single structure - with fixed geometry - can behave very differently depending on its preparation (filled with air, vs. evacuated), because of a dramatic change in the conductance of vapor in the microchannels; this change offers a second way to tune the rate of transport in bi-disperse, xylem-like structures, by switching between air-filled and evacuated states.</description>
