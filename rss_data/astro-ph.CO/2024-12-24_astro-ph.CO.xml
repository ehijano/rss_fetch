      <title>Interacting dark sector with quadratic coupling: theoretical and observational viability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models proposing a non-gravitational interaction between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (CDM) have been extensively studied as alternatives to the standard cosmological model. A common approach to describing the DE-CDM coupling assumes it to be linearly proportional to the dark energy density. In this work, we consider the model with interaction term $Q=3H\gamma{\rho_{x}^{2}}/{(\rho_{c}+\rho_{x})}$. We show that for positive values of $\gamma$ this model predicts a future violation of the Weak Energy Condition (WEC) for the dark matter component, and for a specific range of negative values of $\gamma$ the CDM energy density can be negative in the past. We perform a parameter selection analysis for this model using data from Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and CMB combined with the Hubble constant $H_0$ prior. Imposing a prior to ensure that the WEC is not violated, our model is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM in 2$\sigma$ C.L.. In reality, the WEC prior shifts the constraints towards smaller values of $H_0$, highlighting an increase in the tension on the Hubble parameter. However, it significantly improves the parameter constraints, with a preference for smaller values of $\sigma_8$, alleviating the $\sigma_8$ tension between the CMB results from Planck 2018 and the weak gravitational lensing observations from the KiDS-1000 cosmic shear survey. In the case without the WEC prior, our model seems to alleviate the $H_0$ tension, which is related to the positive value of the interaction parameter $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>A complete analysis of inflation with piecewise quadratic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough study of the comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ in single-field inflation with two stages, represented by a piecewise quadratic potential, where both the first and second derivatives are allowed to be discontinuous at the transition point. We calculate the evolution of $\mathcal{R}$ by combining the perturbative and non-perturbative methods consistently, and obtain the power spectrum and the non-Gaussian features in the probability distribution function. We find that both the spectrum and the statistics of $\mathcal{R}$ depend significantly on the second derivatives of the potential at both the first and second stages. Furthermore, we find a new parameter constructed from the potential parameters, which we call $\alpha$, plays a decisive role in determining various features in the spectrum such as the amplitude, the slope, and the existence of a dip. In particular, we recover the typical $k^4$ growth of the spectrum in most cases, but the maximum growth rate of $k^5(\log k)^2$ can be obtained by fine-tuning the parameters. Then, using the $\delta N$ formalism valid on superhorizon scales, we give fully nonlinear formulas for $\cal{R}$ in terms of the scalar field perturbation $\delta\phi$ and its time derivative. In passing, we point out the importance of the nonlinear evolution of $\delta\phi$ on superhorizon scales. Finally, using the Press-Schechter formalism for simplicity, we discuss the effect of the non-Gaussian tails of the probability distribution function on the primordial black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Chiral Superconducting Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emission of vector radiation by superconducting cosmic string loops, deriving general relations to characterize the vector radiation emission efficiency, and study its impact on the evolution of loops. Building on these results, we compute the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by a chiral superconducting cosmic string network. Our analysis reveals that strong coupling between superconducting cosmic strings and the vector field may lead to a substantial suppression of the gravitational wave signal, while moderate coupling may still produce a detectable signal. We demonstrate that, in this intermediate limit, the presence of superconductivity in cosmic strings may help reconcile their gravitational wave spectrum with pulsar timing array data for large enough values of current.</description>

      <title>Potential Surge Preheating: enhanced resonance from potential features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of local features in the inflationary potential on the preheating dynamics after inflation. We show that a small feature in the potential can enhance the resonance and bring the radiation-like state equation during preheating despite the inflationary potential being a quadratic one. Such localized features may naturally arise due to various physical effects without altering the large-scale predictions of the original model for cosmic microwave background (CMB) observables. We demonstrate that these features effectively introduce localized higher-power terms in the potential, significantly influencing the preheating dynamics $\unicode{x2013}$ a phenomenon we term potential surge preheating. We outline the resulting modifications in energy distribution among different components. We further show that these small-scale features leave detectable imprints in the form of gravitational wave signals. These signals influence CMB measurements of the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, offering a way to reconstruct the shape of the inflaton potential at small scales. Finally, we argue that these modifications to the scalar potential provide a framework to explore preheating dynamics and the fragmentation of scalar fields using simple scalar potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, advancements in observational cosmology have introduced us in an era of precision cosmology, dramatically enhancing our understanding of the Universe's history as well as bringing new tensions to light. Observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background, large-scale structure, and distant galaxies have provided unprecedented insights into the processes that shaped our Universe. This PhD thesis contributes to this research by exploring how these cosmic observables can be leveraged to constrain new physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Dark Sectors in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phase transition in the dark sector (DS) presents a promising explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signals detected in recent observations by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Instead of focusing solely on fitting data with phenomenological parameters, we systematically delineate simple, underlying dark sector (DS) models at the microscopic, Lagrangian level and uncover the conditions required to yield the GW spectrum observed by PTAs. We also illustrate the possibilities of the DS cosmology, which may include a dark matter candidate with a $\mathcal{O}$(MeV) mass.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of Dwarf Galaxies and Their Circumgalactic Medium Across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are thought of as the building blocks of large galaxies such as our Milky Way. This paper presents new high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies and their intergalactic medium with the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations consider the key physical processes of galaxy evolution, such as gas cooling, chemistry, and stellar and black hole feedback. Unlike the previous work, the initial conditions of our simulations taking the dwarf galaxies of $2-5 \times 10^{10} \, M_\odot$ from the realistic cosmology simulations, \texttt{IllustrisTNG}. We further increase the original resolution of \texttt{IllustrisTNG} by a factor of $\sim 100$ via a particle splitting scheme. Our results show that the evolution of complex multiphase CGM and its metal content is sensitive to the redshift of dwarf galaxies. The accretion of CGM into dwarf galaxies plays a key role in providing $20 \% - 50 \%$ of the star-forming gas and replenishing $40 \% - 70 \%$ of the total mass in the galactic disk. Furthermore, the accretion history of supermassive black holes in the centers of high-$z$ dwarf galaxies shows episodic patterns with high-accreting states close to $\sim 10 \%$ of the Eddington mass accretion rate, implying the rapid growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe, which may be revealed by the coming observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).</description>

      <title>Returning Back to Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have re-examined Mukhanov parametrization for inflationary equation of state $1+\omega=\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, in the light of Planck 2018 results and latest bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio employing Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We have found the current observational values of scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can be used efficiently to constrain the model parameters. The recent findings of $r&lt;0.032$ has been used to put an upper bound on one of the model parameter. Whereas the $1-\sigma$ bound of the scalar spectral index $0.9607\leq n_{_S}\leq 0.9691$ along with the upper bound of scalar-to-tensor ratio provided restriction on the other model parameter $1.50\leq\alpha\leq2.20$. This bound depends on the number of e-foldings still left before the end of inflation and whenever $1.50\leq\alpha\leq2.20$ we can find appropriate values of the other model parameter $\beta$ so that the observational predictions are in tune with the latest available inflationary observables.</description>

      <title>Application of 3D U-Net Neural Networks in Extracting the Epoch of Reionization Signal from SKA-Low Observations Based on Real Observations of NCP Field from LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen serves as a crucial probe for the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Actual observations of the 21-cm signal often encounter challenges such as thermal noise and various systematic effects. To overcome these challenges, we simulate SKA-Low-depth images and process them with a deep learning method. We utilized foreground residuals acquired by LOFAR during actual North Celestial Pole field observations, thermal and excess variances calculated via Gaussian process regression, and 21-cm signals generated with 21cmFAST for signal extraction tests. Our approach to overcome these foreground, thermal noise, and excess variance components employs a 3D U-Net neural network architecture for image analysis. When considering thermal noise corresponding to 1400 hours of integration, U-Net provides reliable 2D power spectrum predictions, and robustness tests ensure that we get realistic EoR signals. Adding foreground residuals, however, causes inconsistencies below the horizon delay-line. Lastly, evaluating both thermal and excess variance with observations up to 3700 and 14000 hours ensures reliable power spectrum estimations within the EoR window and across nearly all scales, respectively.</description>

      <title>Prospecting bipartite Dark Matter through Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational wave probes of a two-component dark matter framework, consisting of an $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar and a Standard Model singlet fermion. The triplet scalar dark matter typically remains underabundant in the region below $\sim 1.9$ TeV, due to the strong $SU(2)_L$ gauge mediated interactions. We introduce a second dark matter component, an $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like Dirac fermion, to address this deficit in the dark matter relic abundance within a sub-TeV range. A key aspect of the proposed setup is the potential dark matter inter-conversion between the two components, which impacts the dark matter freeze-out dynamics and relic density of individual dark matter components. In such a scenario, we examine the properties of electroweak phase transition and identify the regions of parameter space that exhibit strong first-order phase transition. We estimate the resulting gravitational wave spectrum and its detectability, which could be probed through the conventional power-law-integrated sensitivity limits and the recently proposed peak-integrated sensitivity curves. Our analysis reveals that a novel region of the model's parameter space, compatible with dark matter observables, can generate a detectable gravitational wave spectrum, observable by upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, and DECIGOcorr, while also offering complementary detection prospects in the dark matter and collider experiments.</description>

      <title>The Quest for the Origins of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made over the past decades towards unveiling the sources of the most energetic particles in nature, the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Despite these advancements, the exact astrophysical sites capable of accelerating these particles to such extreme energies remain largely unknown. Moreover, the mechanisms by which they achieve these extreme energies are poorly understood. Here, I provide a concise overview of the theory underlying the acceleration and propagation of UHECRs. I then critically discuss three recent results that could help unveil their origins: the reported excess around Centaurus A, the correlation with starburst galaxies, and the efforts to jointly model the energy spectrum, composition, and arrival directions. Finally, I discuss strategies for advancing this field, emphasising the need for refined theoretical models, the challenges in building them, and the potential for new observatories to shed light on the mysteries of UHECRs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Inert Scalar Dark Matter with Vector-like Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inert doublet model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM), provides a scalar dark matter (DM) candidate that belongs to the additional Higgs doublet. The model faces challenges in achieving the correct relic abundance for compressed spectra and DM masses in the high-mass range. In this work we introduce a $Z_2$-odd singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) into the IDM framework that helps us alleviate these issues and provide new channels of contributions to the relic abundance. The VLQ not only enhances the DM relic abundance for masses above $~550$ GeV but also eases constraints from direct detection experiments by enabling smaller couplings between the inert scalars and the SM Higgs. We analyze the impact of the VLQ on DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection constraints. The results demonstrate that the extended IDM framework not only resolves existing limitations in the compressed spectrum but also offers exciting prospects for detection in current and future collider experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry-breaking inflation within the framework of metric-affine gravity. By introducing a non-minimal coupling, $\beta(\phi)\tilde{\cal R}$, between the Holst invariant and the inflaton, both small-field and large-field inflationary predictions can be brought into agreement with the latest observational constraints. Remarkably, even for sub-Planckian vacuum expectation values, appropriately chosen values of $\beta(\phi)$ enable viable inflation, a scenario previously considered unattainable.</description>

      <title>Dark gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking with a massless dark photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dark gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (dark GMSB) in a theory with a new unbroken $U(1)_{D}$ local symmetry and massless dark photon. Messenger fields charged under both Standard Model and dark gauge symmetries produce new soft supersymmetry-breaking terms due to gauge kinetic mixing between $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge and $U(1)_D$. We show that large kinetic mixing induces significant distortions to the superpartner spectra relative to conventional GMSB. Notably, shifts in the Higgs soft masses impact the conditions for electroweak symmetry breaking, lowering the $\mu$ parameter and yielding a relatively light Higgsino that may be accessible at the LHC. Furthermore, for very simple messenger representations, a very light bino-dark photino mixed state is present in the spectrum, which may be probed through exotic Higgs boson decays at future Higgs factories. We also examine the cosmological and phenomenological consequences of the messengers, the lightest of which is absolutely stable and carries fractional electric charge.</description>

      <title>Feebly-Interacting Peccei-Quinn Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion is widely studied as a dark matter (DM) candidate and as a solution to the strong CP problem of the Standard Model. In conventional field-theoretic models, a much larger mass scale than the electroweak (EW) scale is typically introduced to spontaneously break Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry with a large enough axion decay constant, $f_a$, thereby avoiding constraints from star cooling. In this paper, I propose an alternative approach to achieving the large decay constant: a PQ scalar field with a large wave function renormalization constant, analogous to a feebly coupled gauge theory. Other dimensionless parameters are ${O}(1)$ in the unit of the EW scale for the naturalness. This framework predicts a light PQ Higgs boson with a mass $\sim (\mathrm{EW~scale})^2 / f_a$. Exotic particles associated with the PQ anomaly are expected to have masses around the EW scale. The proposed model alleviates both the PQ quality and EW scale fine-tuning problems and introduces interesting axion-PQ Higgs cosmologies, encompassing: slim axion DM from a fat string network, heavy axion DM from PQ Higgs condensate fragmentation, PQ Higgs DM, and axion-PQ Higgs co-DM scenarios. Potential experimental signatures are explored, including fifth-force tests, DM detections, accelerator searches, and gravitational wave observations by employing lattice simulation. Possible extensions of the scenario are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A point cloud approach to generative modeling for galaxy surveys at the field level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based generative model to describe the distribution of galaxies in our Universe directly as a collection of points in 3-D space (coordinates) optionally with associated attributes (e.g., velocities and masses), without resorting to binning or voxelization. The custom diffusion model can be used both for emulation, reproducing essential summary statistics of the galaxy distribution, as well as inference, by computing the conditional likelihood of a galaxy field. We demonstrate a first application to massive dark matter haloes in the Quijote simulation suite. This approach can be extended to enable a comprehensive analysis of cosmological data, circumventing limitations inherent to summary statistic -- as well as neural simulation-based inference methods.</description>

      <title>Reconciling $S_8$: Insights from Interacting Dark Sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We do a careful investigation of the prospects of dark energy (DE) interacting with cold dark matter in alleviating the $S_8$ clustering tension. To this end, we consider various well-known parametrizations of the DE equation of state (EoS) and consider perturbations in both the dark sectors, along with an interaction term. Moreover, we perform a separate study for the phantom and non-phantom regimes. Using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae data sets, constraints on the model parameters for each case have been obtained and a generic reduction in the $H_0-\sigma_{8,0}$ correlation has been observed, both for constant and dynamical DE EoS. This reduction, coupled with a significant negative correlation between the interaction term and $\sigma_{8,0}$, contributes to easing the clustering tension by lowering $\sigma_{8,0}$ to somewhere in between the early CMB and late-time clustering measurements for the phantom regime, for almost all the models under consideration. Additionally, this is achieved without exacerbating the Hubble tension. In this regard, the interacting Chevallier-Polarski-Linder and Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan models perform the best in relaxing the $S_8$ tension to $&lt;1\sigma$. However, for the non-phantom regime the $\sigma_{8,0}$ tension tends to have worsened, which reassures the merits of phantom DE from latest data. We further investigate the role of redshift space distortion data sets and find an overall reduction in tension, with a $\sigma_{8,0}$ value relatively closer to the CMB value. We finally check whether further extensions of this scenario, such as the inclusion of the sound speed of DE and warm dark matter interacting with DE, can have some effects.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Natural Inflation with Gauge Field Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The natural inflation model with a periodic cosine potential is ruled out by recent Planck 2018 data for the decay constant $f \lesssim 5.5~M_{\rm Pl}$. If the Planck data is combined with the BICEP Keck array and BAO data, the model is excluded (at $2$-$\sigma$) for all values of $f$. In this context, we revisit the model when the pseudoscalar inflation $\phi$ is coupled with a gauge field via a coupling of the form $\frac{\alpha}{f} \phi F \tilde{F}$, where $F (\tilde F)$ denotes the gauge field (dual) strength tensor, and $\alpha$ is the coupling constant. The back-reactions associated with the gauge field production during the later stages of inflation extend the duration of inflation. We numerically evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the perturbations in the inflaton field. It allows us to determine the scalar and tensor power spectra leading to the calculations of observables at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales. We find that the natural inflation model survives the test of the latest data only for a certain range of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our analysis shows that the latest constraints coming from the scalar spectral index are more stringent than the ones arising from the non-gaussianities and the running of the scalar spectrum. This leads to lower and upper bounds on $\xi_*$, the parameter that controls the growth of the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent chirality as a smoking gun for Abelian gauge fields during inflation</title>

Abstract: Axion-inflation models are a compelling candidate as a mechanism behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe in light of the possibility to embed them in higher dimensional UV complete theories and the exciting prospect of testing them with next-generation cosmological probes. Adding an Abelian gauge sector to axion-inflation models makes for a rich, interesting, phenomenology spanning from primordial black holes to gravitational waves (GWs). Several recent studies employ an approximate analytic (Gaussian) template to characterize the effect of gauge field production on cosmological perturbations. In this work we go beyond such approximation and numerically study particle production and the ensuing scalar and tensor spectra. We find a significant deviation from results based on log-normally distributed vector field excitations. As an important phenomenological application of the improved method, we study the expected chirality and spectral index of the sourced GW background at scales relevant for current and next-generation GW detectors. One striking feature is that of a scale-dependent chirality. We derive a consistency relation between these two observables that can serve as an important tool in identifying key signatures of multi-field dynamics in axion inflation.</description>

      <title>Single and merger soliton dynamics in scalar field dark matter with and without self-interactions</title>

Abstract: (abridged)Scalar field dark matter (SFDM) made of bosons has become a popular alternative to the CDM paradigm, especially for its potential to cure the so-called "small-scale problems" of CDM. Cosmological simulations have determined that SFDM halos exhibit a core-envelope structure, but they are computationally expensive. Halo cores have been found to be well approximated by "solitons". The study of single soliton and multiple soliton merger dynamics constitutes a more feasible approach to investigate in detail the genuine quantum dynamics of SFDM and its interplay with self-gravity for a multitude of free boson parameters. In this paper, we present dedicated simulations of single solitons and binary soliton mergers, for models without and with a 2-boson, repulsive, weak to intermediate self-interaction (SI), as well as multiple soliton mergers without SI. We adapt the open-source code Pyultralight to simulate solitons with SI and make our amended code public. We derive numerical scaling relations between the central density and mass of solitons for several values of SI and find deviations from the monotonic relations known from fuzzy dark matter (no SI), or the strongly repulsive Thomas-Fermi regime. Solitons with SI exemplify larger cores and lower central densities, compared to solitons without SI. Using our simulations, we extract numerical density profiles for solitons and postmerger objects, and fit them to analytical functions of previous literature. We find a mild preference for Gaussian cores for objects with SI, while the envelopes of postmergers can be fit to NFW profiles albeit with some caution as we discuss. Similar to previous work, we find global, persistent oscillations for solitons as well as postmergers, confirming that self-gravitating SFDM has very long relaxation times, although objects with SI exhibit oscillations of comparatively smaller amplitude.</description>

      <title>Detecting ionized bubbles around luminous sources during the reionization era using HI 21-cm signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is of immense importance. We explore the prospects of probing the IGM and sources through redshifted 21-cm observations of individual ionized bubbles surrounding known luminous sources during the EoR. Accordingly, we simulate HI 21-cm maps, foreground contaminants, and system noise which are specific to the uGMRT and SKA1-Low observations. Following the subtraction of the foreground from the total visibility, we employ a visibility-based matched filter technique to optimally combine the desired HI 21-cm signal while minimizing the system noise. Our analysis suggests that these ionized bubbles can be detected with more than $5 \sigma$ significance using approximately $\sim 2000$ and $\sim 3000$ hours of observation time with the uGMRT at redshift $7.1$ and $8.3$, respectively, when the mean neutral hydrogen fraction outside the targeted bubble is $ \sim 0.9$. The SKA1-Low should be able to detect these bubbles with more than $8 \sigma$ significance using only $\sim 100$ hrs of observations. The total observing time increases both for the uGMRT and SKA1-Low when the mean neutral hydrogen fraction outside the targeted bubble decreases. Further, we investigate the impact of foreground subtraction on the detectability and find the signal-to-noise ratio decreases when smaller bandwidth is used. More importantly, we show that the matched filtering method can measure ionized bubble radius and constrain HI-neutral fraction reasonably well, providing deeper insights into the source properties and the intergalactic medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two new summary statistics, the scale-dependent peak height function (scale-PKHF) and the scale-dependent valley depth function (scale-VLYDF) of matter density, and forecast their constraining power on primordial non-Gaussianity and cosmological parameters based on \textsc{Quijote} and \textsc{Quijote-PNG} simulations at $z=0$. With the Fisher analysis, we demonstrate that these statistics outperform the power spectrum and bispectrum. Key findings include: (1) the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ obtained from the scale-VLYDF/scale-PKHF is 1.59/1.10 times tighter than that from the joint analysis of power spectrum and bispectrum; (2) the combination of the two statistics yields a slight improvement in constraining $\{f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{local}, f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{equil}\}$ over the power spectrum-bispectrum combination, and provides a 1.39-fold improvement in the constraint on $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{ortho}$; (3) after incorporating the power spectrum with our new statistics, parameter constraints surpass those from power spectrum-bispectrum combination by factors up to 2.93. This work offers an effective scheme for extracting primordial signals from the late Universe, paving the way for further breakthroughs in precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Modeling the 3-point correlation function of projected scalar fields on the sphere</title>

Abstract: One of the main obstacles for the signal extraction of the three point correlation function using photometric surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will be the prohibitive computation time required for dealing with a vast quantity of sources. Brute force algorithms, which naively scales as $O(N^3)$ with the number of objects, can be further improved with tree methods but not enough to deal with large scale correlations of Rubin's data. However, a harmonic basis decomposition of these higher order statistics reduces the time dramatically, to scale as a two-point correlation function with the number of objects, so that the signal can be extracted in a reasonable amount of time. In this work, we aim to develop the framework to use these expansions within the Limber approximation for scalar (or spin-0) fields, such as galaxy counts, weak lensing convergence or aperture masses. We develop an estimator to extract the signal from catalogs and different phenomenological and theoretical models for its description. The latter includes halo model and standard perturbation theory, to which we add a simple effective field theory prescription based on the short range of non-locality of cosmic fields, significantly improving the agreement with simulated data. In parallel to the modeling of the signal, we develop a code that can efficiently calculate three points correlations of more than 200 million data points (a full sky simulation with Nside=4096) in $\sim$40 minutes, or even less than 10 minutes using an approximation in the searching algorithm, on a single high-performance computing node, enabling a feasible analysis for the upcoming LSST data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a neural network emulator to constrain the thermal parameters of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $\displaystyle{5.4}\le{z}\le{6.0}$ using the Lyman-$\displaystyle\alpha$ (Ly$\displaystyle\alpha$) forest flux auto-correlation function. Our auto-differentiable JAX-based framework accelerates the surrogate model generation process using approximately 100 sparsely sampled Nyx hydrodynamical simulations with varying combinations of thermal parameters, i.e., the temperature at mean density $\displaystyle{T}_{{0}}$, the slope of the temperature$\displaystyle-$density relation $\displaystyle\gamma$, and the mean transmission flux $\displaystyle{\langle}{F}{\rangle}$. We show that this emulator has a typical accuracy of 1.0% across the specified redshift range. Bayesian inference of the IGM thermal parameters, incorporating emulator uncertainty propagation, is further expedited using NumPyro Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We compare both the inference results and computational cost of our framework with the traditional nearest-neighbor interpolation approach applied to the same set of mock Ly$\alpha$ flux. By examining the credibility contours of the marginalized posteriors for $\displaystyle{T}_{{0}},\gamma,\text{and}{\langle}{F}{\rangle}$ obtained using the emulator, the statistical reliability of measurements is established through inference on 100 realistic mock data sets of the auto-correlation function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain can be sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>Modified Gravity Constraints from the Full Shape Modeling of Clustering Measurements from DESI 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints on deviations from general relativity (GR) from the first-year of clustering observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other datasets. We first consider the $\mu(a,k)$-$\Sigma(a,k)$ modified gravity (MG) parametrization (as well as $\eta(a,k)$) in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0 w_a$CDM backgrounds. Using a functional form for time-only evolution gives $\mu_0= 0.11^{+0.44}_{-0.54}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+BBN and a wide prior on $n_{s}$. Using DESI(FS+BAO)+CMB+DESY3+DESY5-SN, we obtain $\mu_0 = 0.05\pm 0.22$ and $\Sigma_0 = 0.008\pm 0.045$ in the $\Lambda$CDM background. In $w_0 w_a$CDM, we obtain $\mu_0 =-0.24^{+0.32}_{-0.28}$ and $\Sigma_0 = 0.006\pm 0.043$, consistent with GR, and we still find a preference of the data for dynamical dark energy with $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$. We then use binned forms in the two backgrounds starting with two bins in redshift and then combining them with two bins in scale for a total of 4 and 8 MG parameters, respectively. All MG parameters are found consistent with GR. We also find that the tension reported for $\Sigma_0$ with GR when using Planck PR3 goes away when we use the recent LoLLiPoP+HiLLiPoP likelihoods. As noted previously, this seems to indicate that the tension is related to the CMB lensing anomaly in PR3 which is also resolved when using these likelihoods. We then constrain the class of Horndeski theory in the effective field theory of dark energy. We consider both EFT-basis and $\alpha$-basis. Assuming a power law parametrization for the function $\Omega$, which controls non-minimal coupling, we obtain $\Omega_0 = 0.012^{+0.001}_{-0.012}$ and $s_0 = 0.996^{+0.54}_{-0.20}$ from DESI(FS+BAO)+DESY5SN+CMB in a $\Lambda$CDM background. Similar results are obtained when using the $\alpha$-basis, where we constrain $c_M&lt;1.14$, and are all consistent with GR. [Abridged.]</description>

      <title>Playground of Lognormal Seminumerical Simulations of~the~Lyman~$\alpha$ Forest: Thermal History of the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to test a potential application of lognormal seminumerical simulations to recover the thermal parameters and Jeans length. This could be suitable for generating large number of synthetic spectra with various input data and parameters, and thus ideal for interpreting the high-quality data obtained from QSO absorption spectra surveys. We use a seminumerical approach to simulate absorption spectra of quasars at redshifts $ 3 \leq z \leq 5$. These synthetic spectra are compared with the 1D flux power spectra and using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis method we determine the temperature at mean density, slope of the temperature-density relation and Jeans length. Our best-fit model is also compared with the evolution of the temperature of the intergalactic medium from various UVB models. We show that the lognormal simulations can effectively recover thermal parameters and Jeans length. Besides, by comparing the synthetic flux power spectra with observations from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopy Survey we found, that such an approach can be also used for the cosmological parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [45] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the main dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.</description>

      <title>Model-independent Reconstruction of UV Luminosity Function and Reionization Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a first comprehensive study of the Luminosity Function (LF) using a non-parametric approach. We use Gaussian Process to fit available luminosity data between redshifts $z \sim 2-8$. Our free-form LF in the non-parametric approach rules out the conventional Schechter function model to describe the abundance-magnitude relation at redshifts $z=3$ and $4$. Hints of deviation from the Schechter function are also noticed at redshifts 2, 7 and 8 at lower statistical significance. Significant deviation starts for brighter ionizing sources at $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21$. The UV luminosity density data at different redshifts are then derived by integrating the LFs obtained from both methods with a truncation magnitude of $-17$. In our analysis, we also include the first 90 arcmin$^2$ JWST/NIRCam data at $z \sim 9-12$. Since at larger magnitudes, we do not find major deviations from the Schechter function, the integrated luminosity density differs marginally between the two methods. Finally, we obtain the history of reionization from a joint analysis of UV luminosity density data along with the ionization fraction data and Planck observation of Cosmic Microwave Background. The history of reionization is not affected by the deviation of LFs from Schechter function at lower magnitudes. We derive reionization optical depth to be $\tau_{\rm re}=0.0494^{+0.0007}_{-0.0006}$ and the duration between 10$\%$ and 90$\% $completion of ionization process is found to be $\Delta z\sim 1.627^{+0.059}_{-0.071}$.</description>

      <title>Spin-independent interactions of Dirac Fermionic Dark Matter in the composite Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves from Scattering, Bremsstrahlung and Decay during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate ultra-high frequency gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitons generated during inflationary reheating. Specifically, we study inflaton scattering with its decay product, where the couplings involved in this $2 \to 2$ scattering are the same as those in the $1 \to 3$ graviton Bremsstrahlung process. We compute the graviton production rate via such $2 \to 2$ scattering. Additionally, we compare the resulting GW spectrum with that from Bremsstrahlung as well as that from pure $2 \to 2$ inflaton scatterings. For completeness, the GW spectrum from graviton pair production through one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is also analyzed. With a systematic comparison among the four sources of GWs, we find that $2 \to 2$ inflaton scattering with its decay product can dominate over Bremsstrahlung if the reheating temperature is larger than the inflaton mass. Pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering is typically subdominant compared to Bremsstrahlung except in the high-frequency tail. The contribution from one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is shown to be suppressed compared to Bremsstrahlung and pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from High Temperature Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite temperature effects in string cosmology and their potential gravitational wave signature. Expanding on our recent work arXiv:2310.11494 , we consider a general configuration of highly excited open and closed strings at high enough temperature to be in the Hagedorn phase in 3+1 dimensions, in order to explore its cosmological implications. We find conditions, which can be satisfied in compactifications with moduli stabilization, that allow the long strings to remain in equilibrium in a controlled effective field theory, with equilibration driven by the joining and splitting of the dominant open string population. We calculate the emission rate of gravitons by long open strings, which we show is determined by ten dimensional flat space transition amplitudes available in the literature, and then find the total gravitational wave spectrum generated by the gas of long strings. The gravitational wave spectrum has robust characteristics. It peaks at frequencies of order 50-100 GHz, the same as for gravitational waves from the reheating epoch of the Standard Model. But the amplitude of the string signal is significantly larger than predicted by the Standard Model and its field theoretic extensions. The amplitude and other physical observables (such as the contribution to $\Delta N_{\text eff}$) are directly proportional to the string scale $M_s$; indicating that a potential signal may also determine the string scale. Our calculations provide one of the few examples of a signal of stringy origin that dominates over the field theory predictions. We give a physical explanation of our results and discuss further implications.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the scalar field potential in nonmetricity gravity through Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe has been widely confirmed, posing challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, particularly the cosmological coincidence problem. This has motivated the exploration of modified gravity theories, including non-metricity gravity, which explains cosmic acceleration without dark energy. In this work, we incorporate a quintessence scalar field into the non-metricity framework to model both inflation and late-time acceleration. Employing the Gaussian process method with a square exponential kernel, we reconstruct the scalar field potential, $V(\phi)$, from observational Hubble data sets coming from cosmic chronometers (CC) as well as from the method of radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in a model-independent approach. This approach allows us to obtain a suitable quintessence scalar field model that aligns with the observational Hubble data under the framework of power-law non-metricity gravity. Additionally, we compare our reconstructed potential with power-law scalar field potentials, revealing that these models show better agreement with the observational data, providing new insights into the dynamics of the universe. In contrast, we find that the early dark energy has minimal effect on the present-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>The UV Sensitivity of Axion Monodromy Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit axion monodromy inflation in the context of UV-complete theories and point out that its cosmological observables are sensitive to heavy fields with masses far above the Hubble scale, such as the moduli of flux compactifications. By studying a string-inspired two-field extension of axion monodromy, we reveal that the oscillatory modulation of the axion potential leads to continuous excitation of heavy fields during inflation when the modulation frequency exceeds the field masses. This finding challenges the conventional single-field description, as heavy moduli cannot be simply integrated out. Using a full bootstrap analysis, we demonstrate that this mechanism produces cosmological collider signals that bypass the usual Boltzmann suppression for heavy masses. Specifically, we identify detectably large signatures of heavy moduli in the primordial bispectrum, offering a promising avenue for probing high-energy physics through cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Age: Star and Galaxy formation in the Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cosmic Dark Ages mark a pivotal era of the universe's evolution, transitioning from a neutral, opaque medium to the emergence of the first stars and galaxies that initiated cosmic reionization. This study examines the thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium (IGM), molecular hydrogen cooling, and gravitational collapse that led to structure formation. Key emission lines, such as Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha $) and [C II] 158 $\mu m$, are analyzed as tracers of star formation, metallicity, and IGM conditions. Simulations highlight Ly$\alpha $ scattering profiles and [C II] emission as critical diagnostics of early galaxy evolution. The findings provide a theoretical framework to interpret high-redshift observations, advancing our understanding of the universe's transition from darkness to illumination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the Newtonian mechanics, in this article, we present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Additionally, using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at linear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.</description>
