      <title>Infinite-order rogue waves that are small (but not small in $L^2$)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General rogue waves of infinite order constitute a family of solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that have recently been identified in a variety of asymptotic limits such as high-order iteration of B\"acklund transformations and semiclassical focusing of pulses with specific amplitude profiles. These solutions have compelling properties such as finite $L^2$-norm contrasted with anomalously slow temporal decay in the absence of coherent structures. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of general rogue waves of infinite order in a parametric limit in which the solution becomes small uniformly on compact sets while the $L^2$-norm remains fixed. We show that the solution is primarily concentrated on one side of a specific curve in logarithmically rescaled space-time coordinates, and we obtain the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the solution in this region in terms of elliptic functions as well as near the boundary curve in terms of modulated solitons. The asymptotic formula captures the fixed $L^2$-norm even as the solution becomes uniformly small.</description>

      <title>Observation of edge solitons and transitions between them in a trimer circuit lattice</title>

Abstract: In nonlinear topological systems, edge solitons either originate from linear topological edge modes or emerge as nonlinearity-induced localized states without topological protection. While electric circuits (ECs) provide a platform for realizing various types of topological insulators, observation of edge solitons and transitions between them in EC lattices remains a challenging problem. Here, we realize quench dynamics in nonlinear ECs to experimentally demonstrate both topologically nontrivial and trivial edge solitons in a trimer EC lattice and transitions between them. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we observe two types of topologically nontrivial edge solitons that originate from the corresponding linear topological edge states, characterized by the presence of mutually antisymmetric or symmetric peaks at two edge sites. Under strong nonlinearity, topologically trivial edge solitons with antisymmetric, symmetric, and asymmetric internal structures are discovered. The work suggests possibilities for exploring sophisticated nonlinear states and transitions between them in nonlinear topological systems.</description>
