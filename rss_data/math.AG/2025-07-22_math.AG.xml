      <title>Galois covers of Calabi-Yau manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Galois rational maps between smooth projective varieties with trivial canonical bundle, with a particular interest in the case where the codomain is Hyper-K\"ahler. We obtain results about the birational geometry and the Galois closure of rational maps between Calabi-Yau manifolds. We apply these general results to a number of well-known examples.</description>

      <title>Weak Fan Structures for Two-Parameter Degenerations of K3 Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we provide an explicit computation of the weak fan associated with a two-parameter degeneration of K3 surfaces. This example serves as a concrete illustration of the general framework developed by Robles and Deng (2023) for the compactification of period maps via nilpotent orbits in the non-Hermitian case. We describe the associated nilpotent cones, examine their compatibility conditions, and construct the weak fan governing the degeneration behavior. This computation contributes to the broader understanding of boundary components of period domains and their relation to limiting mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>Constructive Degenerations and the Algebraicity of Limiting Hodge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel constructive framework for approaching the Hodge Conjecture via explicit degenerations. Building on limiting mixed Hodge structures (LMHS), we formulate a criterion under which a rational class of type (p, p) on a smooth projective variety becomes algebraic in the limit of a semi-stable degeneration. We provide examples where vanishing cycles and monodromy explicitly generate new algebraic classes, and propose a general principle: every rational (p, p) class arises as the limit of algebraic cycles under controlled geometric degenerations. This viewpoint opens a new path toward an effective formulation of the Hodge conjecture.</description>

      <title>The essential and the Cremona dimensions of a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cremona dimension of a group $G$ is the minimal $n$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the Cremona group of birational transformations of an $n$-dimensional rational variety. In this survey article, we give many examples that gives evidence to the conjecture that the Cremona dimension of a finite group over the field of complex numbers is less than or equal to the essential dimension of the group.</description>

      <title>Moduli of Higgs Coherent Systems with stable underlying vector bundles over a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth, connected complex projective curve of genus at least $2$. A Higgs coherent system is an augmented bundle $(E,V)$, where $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle, and $V$ is a linear subspace of the spaces of Higgs bundles of $E$. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce the moduli problem of Higgs coherent systems over $X$. Second, we construct the fine moduli space for Higgs coherent systems with stable underlying vector bundles.</description>

      <title>De Rham-Higgs comparison for mixed Hodge modules in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the nonabelian Hodge theory in positive characteristic developed by Ogus, Vologodsky, and Schepler, we propose a generalization of the decomposition theorem of Deligne and Illusie from the perspective of mixed Hodge modules. This generalization is verified in certain special cases by extending the method of Sheng and the author, leading to several interesting byproducts.</description>

      <title>A Nakayama result for the quantum K theory of homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the ideal of relations in the (equivariant) quantum K ring of a homogeneous space is generated by quantizations of each of the generators of the ideal in the classical (equivariant) K ring. This extends to quantum K theory a result of Siebert and Tian in quantum cohomology. We illustrate this technique in the case of the quantum K ring of partial flag manifolds, using a set of quantum K Whitney relations conjectured by the authors, and recently proved by Huq-Kuruvilla.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin recursion on the mirror curve of $\mathbb{P}^1$ encodes all genus equivariant open Gromov-Witten invariants of $(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1)$. This result can be viewed as an all genus equivariant open mirror symmetry for $(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the sum of the Picard ranks of a polar pair of Gorenstein toric Fano varieties of dimension $d\geq 3$ is at most the minimum of the number of facets and vertices of the corresponding pair of reflexive polytopes minus $(d-1)$. This is a generalization of Eikelberg's theory of affine dependences describing the Picard groups of toric varieties. The upper bound is achieved if and only if the polar pair is a simple-simplicial pair.</description>

Abstract: We survey the Mumford construction of degenerating abelian varieties, with a focus on the analytic version of the construction, and its relation to toric geometry. Moreover, we study the geometry and Hodge theory of multivariable degenerations of abelian varieties associated to regular matroids, and extend some fundamental results of Clemens on 1-parameter semistable degenerations to the multivariable setting.</description>

      <title>Matroids and the integral Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the cohomology class of any curve on a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least 4 is an even multiple of the minimal class. The same holds for the intermediate Jacobian of a very general cubic threefold. This disproves the integral Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties and shows that very general cubic threefolds are not stably rational. Our proof is motivated by tropical geometry; it relies on multivariable Mumford constructions, monodromy considerations, and the combinatorial theory of matroids.</description>

      <title>The fundamental group of the complement of a generic fiber-type curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe and characterize the fundamental group of the complement to generic fiber-type curves, i.e. unions of (the closure of) finitely many generic fibers of a component-free pencil $F=[f:g]:\mathbb C\mathbb P^2\dashrightarrow \mathbb C\mathbb P^1$. We also observe that these groups have already appeared in the literature in examples by Eyral and Oka associated with curves of fiber-type. As a byproduct of our techniques we obtain a criterion to address Zariski's Problem on the commutativity of the fundamental group of the complement of a plane curve.</description>

Moreover, we relate the dimension of the stratum and the dimension of the minimal face of the zonotope containing the corresponding lattice point. We discuss how this correspondence is related to toric varieties and the Bondal-Thomsen generators of their derived categories.</description>

      <title>P-adic Period Conjectures for 1-motives: Integration and Linear Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a $p$-adic theory of periods for 1-motives, extending the classical theory of complex periods into the non-archimedean setting. For 1-motives with good reduction over $p$-adic local fields, we construct a $p$-adic integration pairing that generalizes the Colmez--Fontaine--Messing theory for abelian varieties. This pairing is bilinear, perfect, Galois-equivariant, and compatible with the Hodge filtration, taking values in a quotient of the de Rham period ring.
  Building on this construction, we introduce a stratified formalism for $p$-adic periods, defining period spaces at various depths that capture increasingly refined relations among periods, and formulating conjectures that mirror the Grothendieck period conjecture in this new context. The classical period conjecture for 1-motives over $\bar{Q}$, previously resolved via the Huber--Wustholz analytic subgroup theorem, is recovered at depth 1 in our framework. For 1-motives over number fields with good reduction at $p$, we identify canonical $Q$-structures on the $p$-adic realizations arising from rational points of their associated formal $p$-divisible groups. Relative to these structures, we establish the conjectures at depths 1 and 2.
  A key tool is the development of a $p$-adic analytic subgroup theorem tailored to 1-motives, providing an analogue of Wustholz's classical result. Our work not only yields a $p$-adic counterpart to the Kontsevich--Zagier conjecture for 1-motives but also opens new pathways for the study of linear relations among $p$-adic periods and their transcendence properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $I_A \subset K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be a toric ideal. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the toric variety $V(I_A)$, over an algebraically closed field, to be expressed as the set-theoretic intersection of other toric varieties. We also introduce the invariant ${\rm Split}_{\rm rad}(I_A)$, defined as the smallest integer $r$ for which there exist toric ideals $I_{A_1}, \dots, I_{A_r}$ satisfying $I_A = {\rm rad}(I_{A_1} + \cdots + I_{A_r})$ and $I_{A_i} \neq I_A$ for all $1 \leq i \leq r$. We then compute its exact value in several cases, including the case in which $I_A$ is the toric ideal of a complete bipartite graph. Additionally, we show that ${\rm Split}_{\rm rad}(I_A)$ is equal to the binomial arithmetical rank of $I_A$ when the height of $I_A$ is equal to 2.</description>

      <title>Some Lagrangian quiver Grassmannians for the equioriented cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz. These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C. Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic description of the Noether-Lefschetz components in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.01570v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the definition of Noether-Leschetz components to quasi-smooth hypersurfaces in a projective simplicial toric variety of dimension 2k+1, and prove that asymptotically the components whose codimension is upper bounded by a suitable effective constant correspond to hypersurfaces with which one can associate a small degree k-dimensional subvariety. As a corollary we get an asymptotic characterization of the components with small codimension, generalizing Otwinowska's work for odd-dimensional projective spaces and Green and Voisin's for projective 3-space. Some tools developed in this paper are a generalization of Green's theorem for simplicial toric varieties, and an extension of the notion of artinian Gorenstein ideal for the Cox ring of a toric variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a formula for the cycle class of the supersingular locus in the Chow ring with rational coefficients of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties in characteristic $p$. This formula determines this class as a monomial in the Chern classes of the Hodge bundle up to a factor that is a polynomial in $p$. This factor is known for $g\leq 3$. We determine the factor for $g=4$.</description>

      <title>Algebraization Techniques and Rigid-Analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First, we prove an algebraization result for rig-smooth algebras over a general noetherian ring; this positively answers the question raised in [Sta24, Tag 0GAX]. Then we prove a general partial algebraization result in non-archimedean geometry. The result says that we can always algebraize a geometrically reduced affinoid rigid-analytic space in "one direction" in an appropriate sense. As an application of this result, we show the remaining cases of the Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing for affinoid algebras, which were previously conjectured in [BM21, {\S}7]. This allows us to deduce a stronger version of the rigid-analytic Artin-Grothendieck Vanishing Conjecture (see [Han20, Conj. 1.2]) over a field of characteristic 0. Using a completely different set of ideas, we also obtain a weaker version of this conjecture over a field of characteristic p&gt;0.</description>

Abstract: We investigate obstruction classes of moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces. We extend previous results by Caldararu, explicitly determining the obstruction class and its order in the Brauer group. Our main theorem establishes a short exact sequence relating the Brauer group of the moduli space to that of the underlying K3 surface. This provides a criterion for when the moduli space is fine, generalising well-known results for K3 surfaces. Additionally, we explore applications to Ogg-Shafarevich theory for Beauville-Mukai systems. Furthermore, we investigate birational equivalences of Beauville-Mukai systems on elliptic K3 surfaces, presenting a complete characterisation of such equivalences.</description>

      <title>Generic motives and motivic cohomology of fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of generic motives and their implications for the motivic cohomology of fields. Originating in Voevodsky's theory of motives and related to Beilinson's vision of a motivic $t$-structure, generic motives serve as pro-objects encoding essential information about cycles and cohomology. We present new computations of generic motives, focusing on curves and surfaces. These computations suggest a conjectural framework for morphisms of generic motives and highlight the central role of transcendental motives. We then focus on the motivic cohomology of fields, building on Borel's rank computation of K-theory and its relation to higher regulators. We provide a direct argument for determining the weights in the $\lambda$-structure of the K-theory of number fields, bypassing the need for regulator maps. We show that motivic cohomology groups are often of infinite rank, typically matching the cardinality of the base field. For instance, we prove that motivic cohomology groups of $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb C$ are uncountable in many bi-degrees. Despite this, we propose a conjecture that complements the Beilinson-Soul\'e vanishing conjecture, suggesting that the growth of motivic cohomology is more controlled than these results may initially indicate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new examples of anti-symplectic involutions on moduli spaces of stable sheaves on K3 surfaces. These involutions are constructed through (anti) autoequivalences of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on K3 surfaces arising from spherical bundles. We analyze these induced maps in the moduli space, imposing restrictions on the Mukai vector and considering the preservation of stability conditions. Our construction extends and unifies classical examples, such as the Beauville involutions, Markman-O'Grady reflections and a more recent construction by Beri-Manivel.</description>

      <title>On Brauer groups of tame stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop some general tools for computing the Brauer group of a tame algebraic stack $\mathscr X$ by studying the difference between it and the Brauer group of the coarse space $X$ of $\mathscr X$. It is our hope that these tools will be used to simplify future computations of Brauer groups of stacks. Informally, we show that $\operatorname{Br}\mathscr X$ is often built from $\operatorname{Br} X$ and "information about the Picard groups of the fibers of $\mathscr X\to X$''. Along these lines, we compute, for example, the Brauer group of the moduli stack $\mathscr Y(1)_S$ of elliptic curves, over any regular noetherian $\mathbb Z[1/2]$-scheme $S$ as well as the Brauer groups of (many) stacky curves (allowing generic stabilizers) over algebraically closed fields.</description>

Abstract: We show that, for a $K_0$-regular projective normal surface $X$ over a perfect field $k$ of positive characteristic and a reduced effective Cartier divisor $D\hookrightarrow X$, the Chow group of zero cycles on $X$ with modulus $D$ coincides with the 0-th Suslin homology of $X\setminus D$. Moreover, we show that this isomorphism also holds for a projective smooth scheme of any dimension with a reduced effective Cartier divisor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of motivic cohomology for quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes, which generalises the construction of Elmanto--Morrow in the case of schemes over a field. Our construction is non-$\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant in general, but it uses the classical $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant motivic cohomology of smooth $\mathbb{Z}$-schemes as an input. The main new input of our construction is a global filtration on topological cyclic homology, whose graded pieces provide an integral refinement of derived de Rham cohomology and Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze's syntomic cohomology. Our theory satisfies various expected properties of motivic cohomology, including relations to \'etale cohomology and to non-connective algebraic $K$-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternars, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of real algebraic functions into curves with prescribed Reeb graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss reconstructing smooth real algebraic maps onto curves whose Reeb graph is as prescribed. This can be contributed to real algebraic geometry, especially in explicit examples in real algebraic geometry in a new way. The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of all single points and a natural quotient space of the manifold with the vertex set being all connected components containing some singular points of it. This gives a strong tool in geometry of manifolds and appeared already in 1950 with Morse functions.
  The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least 2 is a graph with exactly two vertices and one edge. We reconstruct functions, from general finite graphs, conversely. In the differentiable situations, Sharko pioneered this in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki and Michalak, mainly. Related real algebraic situations have been launched and studied by the author. The curve-valued case is first considered here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a project on dream (or memoryless) principalization and resolution methods. It extends this theory from the case of schemes with enough derivations, which was established in [Tem25], to general excellent schemes of characteristic zero. So, similarly to McQuillan's approach developed in [McQ20], the approach of [ATW24] is now extended to the generality of all excellent schemes of characteristic zero. In addition, we precisely describe the set of invariants of canonical centers and establish the resolution in the non-embedded form, where one applies simple (stack-theoretical) modifications along subschemes of a special form that we call tubes. In the regular case these are precisely the subschemes corresponding to canonical centers.</description>

Abstract: Discrete signatures are invariants computed from time series corresponding to the discretised version of the signature of paths. We study the algebraic varieties arising from their images, the discrete signature varieties. We introduce them and compute their dimension in many cases. From a particular subclass of these varieties, we derive a partial solution to the Chen-Chow theorem for complex-valued time series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10226v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Singer conjecture and Gromov-L\"uck inequality $\chi \geq |\sigma|$ for aspherical complex surfaces. We give a proof of the Singer conjecture for aspherical complex surface with residually finite fundamental group that does not rely on Gromov's K\"ahler groups theory. Without the residually finiteness assumption, we observe that this conjecture can be proven for all aspherical complex surfaces except possibly those in Class $\mathrm{VII}_0^+$ (a positive answer to the global spherical shell conjecture would rule out the existence of aspherical surfaces in this class). We also sharpen Gromov's inequality for aspherical complex surfaces that are not in Class $\mathrm{VII}_0^+$. This is achieved by connecting the circle of ideas of the Singer conjecture with the study of Reid's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Let A^d denote the coefficient space of all degree-d polynomials f in one variable for some d\ge 3. For any \bar{f} in A^d(\bar\F_p), a rank-\ell Artin-Schreier curve X_{\bar{f},\ell}: y^{p^\ell}-y= \bar{f} is called ordinary if its normalized Newton polygon achieves the infimum in A^d(\bar\F_p). Given \ell and a number field K, we show that there exists a Zariski dense open subset U in A^d, defined over Q, such that if f in U(K) then X_{(f\bmod \wp),\ell} is ordinary for all primes $\wp|p$ with deg(\wp) in \ell\Z and p large enough.</description>

      <title>Fast computation of 2-isogenies in dimension 4 and cryptographic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimension 4 isogenies have first been introduced in cryptography for the cryptanalysis of Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) and have been used constructively in several schemes, including SQIsignHD, a derivative of SQIsign isogeny based signature scheme. Unlike in dimensions 2 and 3, we can no longer rely on the Jacobian model and its derivatives to compute isogenies. In dimension 4 (and higher), we can only use theta-models. Previous works by Romain Cosset, David Lubicz and Damien Robert have focused on the computation of $\ell$-isogenies in theta-models of level $n$ coprime to $\ell$ (which requires to use $n^g$ coordinates in dimension $g$). For cryptographic applications, we need to compute chains of $2$-isogenies, requiring to use $\geq 3^g$ coordinates in dimension $g$ with state of the art algorithms.
  In this paper, we present algorithms to compute chains of $2$-isogenies between abelian varieties of dimension $g\geq 1$ with theta-coordinates of level $n=2$, generalizing a previous work by Pierrick Dartois, Luciano Maino, Giacomo Pope and Damien Robert in dimension $g=2$. We propose an implementation of these algorithms in dimension $g=4$ to compute endomorphisms of elliptic curve products derived from Kani's lemma with applications to SQIsignHD and SIDH cryptanalysis. We are now able to run a complete key recovery attack on SIDH when the endomorphism ring of the starting curve is unknown within a few seconds on a laptop for all NIST SIKE parameters.</description>

      <title>Witt vectors and $\delta$-Cartier rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a universal property of the construction of the ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors of a commutative ring, endowed with Witt vectors Frobenius and Verschiebung, and generalize this construction to the derived setting. We define an $\infty$-category of $p$-typical derived $\delta$-Cartier rings and show that the derived ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors of a derived ring is naturally an object in this $\infty$-category. Moreover, we show that for any prime $p$, the formation of the derived ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors gives an equivalence between the $\infty$-category of all derived rings and the full subcategory of all derived $p$-typical $\delta$-Cartier rings consisting of $V$-complete objects.</description>
