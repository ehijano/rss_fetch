      <title>Photoluminescent registration of fullerite C$_{60}$ derivatives during chemical interaction with H$_{2}$ and N$_{2}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of C$_{60}$ saturated with molecular hydrogen and nitrogen were studied using the spectral-luminescent method of registration in the quantum counting mode at a low temperature of 20 K. Previously, it was found that the temperature limit of the adsorption crossover (the transition from the diffusion mechanism of intercalation - physisorption to chemical interaction - chemisorption) for fullerite C$_{60}$ in an H$_{2}$ atmosphere is about 525 K, and in an N$_{2}$ atmosphere 695 K, respectively. At saturation temperatures above those indicated, the process of chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerite matrix occurs with the formation of new compounds. Therefore, saturation was carried out at temperatures of 570 K for hydrogen and 720 K for nitrogen under a pressure of 30 atm. For the first time, the results of registration of photoluminescent radiation at low temperatures from new substances based on fullerite C60 are presented. A mixture of weakly saturated fulleranes C$_{60}$H$_{X}$ was obtained by saturation of hydrogen from the gas phase at a temperature close to the sorption crossover temperature, and their low-temperature photoluminescence was identified for the first time. The analysis of the "blue" shift of the beginning of the spectrum of such radiation allowed us to more accurately attribute the obtained material to the initial segment of the fullerane series. The presence of radiation of the azafullerene dimer (biazafullerene) (C$_{59}$N)$_{2}$ in the spectra of the reaction products of C$_{60}$ with N$_{2}$ was also detected. It was shown that for polycrystalline samples of C$_{60}$ saturated in a nitrogen atmosphere, the characteristic luminescence of biazafullerene with a maximum at 1.53 eV determines the intensity and shape of the entire short-wave part of the emission spectrum of the complex of synthesized substances.</description>

      <title>NMRTrans: Structure Elucidation from Experimental NMR Spectra via Set Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is fundamental for molecular structure elucidation, yet interpreting spectra at scale remains time-consuming and highly expertise-dependent. While recent spectrum-as-language modeling and retrieval-based methods have shown promise, they rely heavily on large corpora of computed spectra and exhibit notable performance drops when applied to experimental measurements. To address these issues, we build NMRSpec, a large-scale corpus of experimental $^1$H and $^{13}$C spectra mined from chemical literature, and propose NMRTrans, which models spectra as unordered peak sets and aligns the model's inductive bias with the physical nature of NMR. To our best knowledge, NMRTrans is the first NMR Transformer trained solely on large-scale experimental spectra and achieves state-of-the-art performance on experimental benchmarks, improving Top-10 Accuracy over the strongest baseline by +17.82 points (61.15% vs. 43.33%), and underscoring the importance of experimental data and structure-aware architectures for reliable NMR structure elucidation.</description>

      <title>Field-driven Ion Pairing Dynamics in Concentrated Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate ion pairing dynamics in electrolytes driven far from equilibrium using molecular simulations and nonequilibrium rate theory. Focusing on 0.5 M $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$ in water and acetonitrile under uniform electric fields, we compute transition path theory observables including reactive fluxes and mean first-passage times of ion pairing. Moreover, we introduce a dynamical proxy of free-ion population, where its field-induced change is strongly correlated with the nonlinear enhancement of conductivity, yielding an increase of $40 \ \%$ at 50 mV/{\AA} in acetonitrile, compared to less than $10 \ \%$ in aqueous electrolytes. Further kinetic analysis elucidates that Onsager's classical theory substantially overestimates field-induced enhancement of ion pair dissociation in molecular electrolytes. This discrepancy arises from solvent-mediated dynamical pathways and field-induced dielectric decrement that suppress ion pair dissociation within explicit solvents, highlighting that a faithful description of molecular details is essential. Our results provide a molecular interpretation of nonlinear electrolyte transport beyond continuum theories and establish a general framework for quantifying nonequilibrium reaction kinetics in condensed phase systems.</description>

      <title>Constrained nuclear-electronic orbital second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multicomponent second-order M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) method is derived and implemented within the constrained nuclear-electronic orbital (cNEO) framework from a multicomponent generalization of the Hylleraas functional. The cNEO-MP2 method includes electronic-nuclear and nuclear correlation in the calculation of vibrationally averaged molecular properties, and is the first post Hartree-Fock wavefunction-based cNEO method. Nuclear quantum effects like vibrational averaging, isotopic effects, and zero-point energy can be captured in a single calculation or geometry optimization with cNEO-MP2, eliminating the need to perform costly subsequent calculations to determine higher order force constants as required with many existing methods used to determine vibrational effects upon molecular properties. The cNEO-MP2 method is benchmarked on a test set of diatomic and small polyatomic molecules and ions. Herein, we present internuclear distances, bond angles, potential energy surfaces, and vibrational frequencies calculated with the cNEO-MP2 method to demonstrate that it correctly captures the effects of nuclear vibrational motion upon molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Connection between $GW$ and Extended Coupled Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled-cluster (CC) theory and Green's function many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) have long evolved as distinct yet complementary frameworks for describing electronic correlation. While CC methods employ exponential wavefunction parametrizations that guarantee size extensivity and systematic improvability, Green's function approaches such as the $GW$ approximation describe quasiparticle and optical excitations through diagrammatic resummations. Recent analyses have established a formal correspondence between these frameworks: the $GW$ approximation is equivalent to an equation-of-motion (EOM) treatment of the direct-ring coupled-cluster doubles (drCCD) method. Within this context, the extended CC (ECC) ansatz offers a unified framework connecting CC and MBPT. This formulation bridges CC-based and Green's function-based methods, providing novel avenues for incorporating vertex corrections within a CC framework that keep a positive semi-definite self-energy and lead to potentially systematically improvable Green's function approaches.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Delocalization Error through Localized Orbital Scaling Correction with Orbital Relaxation from Linear Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the great success Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) has achieved, the delocalization error remains a major challenge for commonly used density functional approximations (DFAs), resulting in systematic errors in ionization energies, electron affinities, band structures, and charge distributions. A recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) method, namely linear response LOSC (lrLOSC), addresses these challenges by incorporating a functional correction that includes the screening effect and orbital localization within the LOSC framework. The method has been shown to provide accurate descriptions of bulk systems and core-level binding energies in small molecular systems. In this work, we extend the applicability of lrLOSC to a broader range of molecular systems, spanning various sizes, with a focus on the corrections to valence orbital energies and total energies. To enable the calculation of large chemical systems, we developed an efficient implementation of lrLOSC with computational costs comparable to standard KS-DFT calculations. Numerical results show that, while screening provides modest improvements for small molecules, it becomes critical for achieving high accuracy in larger molecules, from linear to three-dimensional systems. With the screening effect well captured in a unified way, lrLOSC provides accurate descriptions for a wide range of chemical systems, including organic molecular systems of varying sizes and transition-metal oxide complexes, establishing it as a powerful tool for enhancing the reliability of computational simulations of chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Initial Guesses for Multicomponent Mean-Field Methods: Assessment and New Developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of self-consistent field equations in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital methods strongly depends on the choice of initial guesses for quantum nuclei. Although several such guesses have been proposed in the literature, a systematic comparison of their performance as well as attempts of constructing novel approximations based on model tasks of quantum mechanics were not reported to date. In this work, we address both issues by introducing novel nuclear initial guesses derived from the analytical solutions of the three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and benchmarking them against existing approaches. We demonstrate that the isotropic variant of our guess outperforms existing approximations in nuclear-electronic orbital density functional theory calculations employing a simultaneous self-consistent field convergence protocol. Although our guess requires the computation of partial Hessians, we demonstrate that these can be evaluated with low-cost methods without affecting the accuracy of resulting protonic density matrices. Our results demonstrate that the proposed guess is robust and efficient and could provide a route to improved convergence in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital computations.</description>

      <title>Machine learning exploration of binding energy distributions of H2O at astrochemically relevant dust grain surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binding energies (BEs) of adsorbates on interstellar dust grains critically control adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and surface reactivity, and therefore strongly influence astrochemical models of star- and planet-forming regions. While recent computational studies increasingly report full distributions of BEs rather than single representative values, these distributions are typically derived for either bare grain surfaces or thick water-ice mantles. In this work, we bridge these regimes by systematically investigating the BE distributions of water on partially and fully ice-covered dust grain surfaces.
  We employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on graph neural networks to model water adsorption on graphene and on the Mg-terminated (010) surface of forsterite, representing carbonaceous and silicate grains, respectively. The models enable extensive sampling of adsorption sites on water clusters, monolayers, and bilayers generated under both crystalline (thermally processed) and amorphous (low-temperature) growth conditions. At submonolayer coverage, the chemical nature of the underlying grain strongly affects both ice morphology and binding energies, with Mg-O interactions on silicate surfaces producing particularly deep binding sites. From monolayer coverage onward, adsorption on both substrates is dominated by hydrogen bonding within the ice, reducing the influence of the grain material.
  Across all coverages, amorphous ice structures systematically shift the BE distributions toward stronger binding compared to crystalline ice, introducing highly stable defect and pocket sites. These results demonstrate that BE distributions in the submonolayer to few-layer ice regime are broad and highly surface dependent, and they provide physically motivated input for next-generation astrochemical models incorporating surface heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Projection-Based Memory Kernel Coupling Theory for Quantum Dynamics: A Stable Framework for Non-Markovian Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a projection-based, stability-preserving methodology for computing time correlation functions in open quantum systems governed by generalized quantum master equations with non-Markovian effects. Building upon the memory kernel coupling theory framework, our approach transforms the memory kernel hierarchy into a system of coupled linear differential equations through Mori-Zwanzig projection, followed by spectral projection onto stable eigenmodes to ensure numerical stability. By systematically eliminating unstable modes while preserving the physically relevant dynamics, our method guaranties long-time convergence without introducing artificial damping or ad hoc modifications. The theoretical framework maintains mathematical rigor through orthogonal projection operators and spectral decomposition. Benchmark calculations on the spin-boson model show excellent agreement with exact hierarchical equations of motion results while achieving significant computational efficiency. This approach provides a versatile and reliable framework for simulating non-Markovian dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling equilibrium molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution is a longstanding challenge. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.</description>

      <title>A statistical theory of structure in many-particle systems with local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of structure is formulated for systems of many structureless classical particles with stable local interactions in Euclidean space. Such systems are shown to have their structure in thermodynamic equilibrium determined exactly by a random field of fine local descriptions and approximately by coarsenings thereof. The degree of order in the local cluster consisting of a particle and its neighbors is identified as a universal source of coarse local descriptions and characterized by expressing the behavior of configurational entropy in local microscopic terms. A local measure of the angular redundancy in neighboring particle positions is found to satisfy this characterization and thereby established as a valid local order quantifier. A precise relationship between order and symmetry is obtained by bounding this quantifier sharply from below by a simple function of the local point group and the largest stabilizer under its action on the set of bond pairs. The marginal distribution of the quantifier is given in closed form for highly coordinated particles with broadly distributed bond angles. Applications are made to the ideal gas, perfect crystal, and simple liquid.</description>

      <title>Pseudorotation and N-body Forces in an Optical Matter System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isomerization in molecular systems almost invariably occurs through 3-dimensional motion due to the nature of chemical bonding. Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM "kite" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., "teardrop"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Multidimensional Free Energy Estimation via Physics-Informed Score Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological processes involve numerous coupled degrees of freedom, yet free-energy estimation is often restricted to one-dimensional profiles to mitigate the high computational cost of multidimensional sampling. In this work, we extend Fokker--Planck Score Learning (FPSL) to efficiently reconstruct two-dimensional free-energy landscapes from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations using different types of collective variables. We show that explicitly modeling orthogonal degrees of freedom reveals insights hidden in one-dimensional projections at negligible computational overhead. Additionally, exploiting symmetries in the underlying landscape enhances reconstruction accuracy, while regularization techniques ensure numerical robustness in sparsely sampled regions. We validate our approach on three distinct systems: the conformational dynamics of alanine dipeptide, as well as coarse-grained and all-atom models of solute permeation through lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, because FPSL learns a smooth score function rather than histogram-based densities, it overcomes the exponential scaling of grid-based methods, establishing it as a data-efficient and scalable tool for multidimensional free-energy estimation.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Enhanced Coercive Field by Chiral Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect demonstrates a strong coupling between electron spin and molecular chirality, enabling spin-controlled interactions between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces. While CISS experiments have revealed robust changes in the spin-polarization properties of magnetic materials upon chiral molecular adsorption, the temperature dependence of these effects remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the chirality-induced increase in magnetic coercivity by ribose-aminooxazoline (RAO) crystals on ferromagnetic surfaces. RAO was selected as a conglomerate-forming, thermodynamically stable crystalline chiral organic molecule with prebiotic relevance that has previously been shown to induce strong spin-dependent changes in magnetic minerals. Contrary to classical expectations that magnetic coercivity weakens at elevated temperatures, we observe a significant increase in magnetic coercivity (1 mT over a 60 C temperature change) with increasing temperature. These results support a vibronic contribution to CISS arising from electron-phonon interactions and demonstrate that spin-dependent interactions between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces can become more effective at higher temperatures, providing new insight into the microscopic origins of CISS and the environmental robustness of spin-controlled asymmetric processes.</description>

      <title>Charged excitations made neutral: N-centered ensemble density functional theory of Fukui functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An in-principle exact working equation to compute electronic affinity and ionization Fukui functions is derived within the $N$-centered (Nc) ensemble extension of density functional theory (DFT). It circumvents the kernel derivative discontinuity problem of DFT for fractional electron numbers, whose contribution is recovered through weight derivatives of the ensemble density functional potential. Thus, it allows for the design of alternative and effective approximations, such as the weight-dependent scaling of regular functionals or the interpolation between known limits of Nc ensembles</description>

      <title>FragmentFlow: Scalable Transition State Generation for Large Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are central to understanding and quantitatively predicting chemical reactivity and reaction mechanisms. Although traditional TS generation methods are computationally expensive, recent generative modeling approaches have enabled chemically meaningful TS prediction for relatively small molecules. However, these methods fail to generalize to practically relevant reaction substrates because of distribution shifts induced by increasing molecular sizes. Furthermore, TS geometries for larger molecules are not available at scale, making it infeasible to train generative models from scratch on such molecules. To address these challenges, we introduce FragmentFlow: a divide-and-conquer approach that trains a generative model to predict TS geometries for the reactive core atoms, which define the reaction mechanism. The full TS structure is then reconstructed by re-attaching substituent fragments to the predicted core. By operating on reactive cores, whose size and composition remain relatively invariant across molecular contexts, FragmentFlow mitigates distribution shifts in generative modeling. Evaluated on a new curated dataset of reactions involving reactants with up to 33 heavy atoms, FragmentFlow correctly identifies 90% of TSs while requiring 30% fewer saddle-point optimization steps than classical initialization schemes. These results point toward scalable TS generation for high-throughput reactivity studies.</description>

      <title>Linear Analysis of Stochastic Verlet-Type Integrators for Langevin Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an analytical framework for analyzing the quality of stochastic Verlet-type integrators for simulating the Langevin equation. Focusing only on basic objective measures, we consider the ability of an integrator to correctly simulate two characteristic configurational quantities of transport, a) diffusion on a flat surface and b) drift on a tilted planar surface, as well as c) statistical sampling of a harmonic potential. For any stochastic Verlet-type integrator expressed in its configurational form, we develop closed form expressions to directly assess these three most basic quantities as a function of the applied time step. The applicability of the analysis is exemplified through twelve representative integrators developed over the past five decades, and algorithm performance is conveniently visualized through the three characteristic measures for each integrator. The GJ set of integrators stands out as the only option for correctly simulating diffusion, drift, and Boltzmann distribution in linear systems, and we therefore suggest that this general method is the one best suited for high quality thermodynamic simulations of nonlinear and complex systems, including for relatively high time steps compared to simulations with other integrators.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion in Driven Electrolytes due to Hydrodynamic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field-theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour that includes two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Ligand-like Molecules through Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization in Density Matrix Embedding Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.</description>
