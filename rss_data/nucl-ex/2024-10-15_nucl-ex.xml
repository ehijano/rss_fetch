      <title>Measurement of Quadrupole Deformation using E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ Transitions in Heavy Isotopes in the Mass Range of $150&lt;A&lt;250$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) in atoms is crucial for understanding the origins of CP-violation. However, accurate interpretation of the EDM in systems involving deformed isotopes requires the characterization of their deformation. While nuclear deformation is indicated in various structure models, there is substantial mutual disagreement between the theoretical models or between theoretical models and experimental values.
  Nuclear E$2$ transitions allow access to quantify quadrupole deformation, but these transitions are often mixed with M$1$ transitions. Both E$2$ and M$1$ transitions are well characterized by Weisskopf estimates, which rely on a single-particle approximation, but deviate due to collective nuclear deformations. Previously, Weisskopf estimates were only available for the mass range $A&lt;150$, and in this work we have extended the Weisskopf estimates of both E$2$ and M$1$ transition lifetimes to the mass range of $150\le A\le 250$.
  We comprehensively studied the deviation of E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes from the newly established Weisskopf estimates in $91$ candidate isotopes, by comparing the transition lifetimes of the candidate isotopes to their nearest even-even counterparts, whose E$2$ transition strengths are very well understood. Estimates of collective nuclear quadrupole deformation in $67$ of these isotopes were thus obtained, either from E$2$ or M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes. In $32$ cases they were obtained from both types of transitions independently, and are mutually consistent, as well as following the trends established in theory. We thereby identify the isotopes $^{223,225}$Fr, $^{221,223}$Ra, $^{223,225,227}$Ac and $^{229}$Pa, where EDM measurements are foreseen and information on nuclear deformation is needed, for which no measurement of nuclear quadrupole deformation has been made.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking, chiral partners, and the $K_1$ and $K^*$ in medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify the concept of chiral partners. For a vector meson, the isospin-zero and hypercharge-zero state in the flavor octet mixes with the flavor singlet state. Since the flavor singlet vector meson does not have a chiral partner, the mixed $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons will not have chiral partners. This means that even when chiral symmetry is restored, these mesons will not become degenerate with their corresponding parity partners. On the other hand, the $K_1$ and $K^*$ mesons are chiral partners, and both have widths smaller than 100 MeV. Therefore, we emphasize that studying these mesons in environments where chiral symmetry is restored is particularly important for understanding the effect of chiral symmetry restoration on chiral partners and their masses.</description>

      <title>Role of the tensor force in induced fission of 240Pu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Results: We find that the tensor force affects the height of fission barriers and the double-humped structure of fission path of 240Pu. On the PES, the fission valley becomes larger in the (Q20, Q30) plane, and the triaxial deformation is suppressed around the outer barrier after considering the tensor force. Incorporating the tensor force into the dynamical process enhances the difference in shape evolution between two asymmetric channels. More interestingly, the charge distribution from TDHF with double PNP calculations shows a strong odd-even effect after including the tensor force. In addition, the total mass and charge distributions of fission fragments show a slight shift towards larger asymmetry and are more consistent with the experiments when tensor components are included. We also find that the tensor force enhances energy gaps of the deformed shells for heavy fragments. Moreover, the TKEs of fragments are in accord with the experiments, and after incorporating the tensor force, we observe a higher concentration of the calculated TKEs for heavy fragments at Z = 52 and Z = 56. Conclusions: The tensor force plays a role in both static and dynamical processes in nuclear fission, improving the accuracy of theoretical descriptions within the current framework. Our calculations have shown that the fission-barrier height with SLy5t is closer to the empirical value than that of SLy5. Additionally, the inclusion of the tensor force not only manifests the odd-even effect in charge distribution but also improves the description of total mass and charge distributions.</description>

      <title>Simplified Efficiency Calibration Methods for Scintillation Detectors Used in Nuclear Remediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study introduces innovative methods to address waste reduction and enhance resource efficiency in nuclear cleanup processes. We focus on sustainable nuclear technology, aligning with goals for cleaner production and environmental protection. We developed two novel methods, termed "oversimplified" and "simplified," for easily determining the photopeak efficiency of NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors. These methods, along with a "general" solution method, were validated with calibrated radioactive sources such as 241Am, 57Co, 133Ba, 137Cs, and 60Co, and were used to commission a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector system at Chalk River Laboratories (CRL) for nuclear remediation. The system demonstrated high accuracy, making it suitable for screening unstable isotopes at contaminated sites. This screening tool significantly reduces the number of soil samples requiring detailed characterization, thereby lowering operational costs. The NaI(Tl) detector system was calibrated for near-contact geometry, which is commonly used at CRL. Detection limits were established for this configuration. By improving the efficiency calibration of scintillation detectors, our study advances sustainable nuclear remediation practices, promoting environmental sustainability and cleaner production processes.</description>

      <title>Recent $J/\psi$ measurements at the PHENIX experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quarkonium is an ideal probe to explore the properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Unlike Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements, quarkonium production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has different production mechanisms, can access different kinematic phase space and may experience different medium densities/temperatures. The PHENIX experiment has collected a large $J/\psi \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ data set within its unique pseudorapidity region of $1.2&lt;|\eta|&lt;2.2$ in $p+p$, $p+A$ and $A+A$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV from 2014 to 2016. Latest results of normalized charged particle multiplicity dependent normalized forward $J/\psi$ yields and normalized forward $\psi(2S)$ to $J/\psi$ ratio in 200 GeV $p+p$ collisions as well as forward $J/\psi$ azimuthal anisotropy in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will be shown. Comparison with other RHIC and LHC measurements and latest theoretical calculations will be discussed. These PHENIX results provide their unique contributions in improving the understanding of the multi-parton interaction contribution to charmonium production and the recombination/coalescence contribution to charmonium formation within Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) at RHIC energies.</description>

      <title>Final Results of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR's Search for Double-Beta Decay of $^{76}$Ge to Excited States of $^{76}$Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $^{76}$Ge can $\beta\beta$ decay into three possible excited states of $^{76}$Se, with the emission of two or, if the neutrino is Majorana, zero neutrinos. None of these six transitions have yet been observed. The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR was designed to study $\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge using a low background array of high purity germanium detectors. With 98.2 kg-y of isotopic exposure, the DEMONSTRATOR sets the strongest half-life limits to date for all six transition modes. For $2\nu\beta\beta$ to the $0^+_1$ state of $^{76}$Se, this search has begun to probe for the first time half-life values predicted using modern many-body nuclear theory techniques, setting a limit of $T_{1/2}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$ y (90% CL).</description>

      <title>Disentangling the development of collective flow in high energy proton proton collisions with a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the collective flow development in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions with a multiphase transport model (AMPT) based on PYTHIA8 initial conditions with a sub-nucleon structure. It is found that the PYTHIA8 based AMPT model can reasonably describe both the charged hadron productions and elliptic flow experimental data measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. By turning on the parton and hadron rescatterings in AMPT separately, we find that the observed collective flow in pp collisions is largely developed during the parton evolution, while no significant flow effect can be generated with the pure hadronic rescatterings. It is also shown that the parton escape mechanism is important for describing both the magnitude of the two-particle cumulant and the sign of the four-particle cumulants. We emphasize that the strong mass ordering of the elliptic flow results from the coalescence process in the transport model and can thus be regarded as unique evidence related to the creation of deconfined parton matter in high energy pp collisions.</description>
