      <title>Motif Caller: Sequence Reconstruction for Motif-Based DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA data storage is rapidly gaining traction as a long-term data archival solution, primarily due to its exceptional durability. Retrieving stored data relies on DNA sequencing, which involves a process called basecalling -- a typically costly and slow task that uses machine learning to map raw sequencing signals back to individual DNA bases (which are then translated into digital bits to recover the data). Current models for basecalling have been optimized for reading individual bases. However, with the advent of novel DNA synthesis methods tailored for data storage, there is significant potential for optimizing the reading process. In this paper, we focus on Motif-based DNA synthesis, where sequences are constructed from motifs -- groups of bases -- rather than individual bases. To enable efficient reading of data stored in DNA using Motif-based DNA synthesis, we designed Motif Caller, a machine learning model built to detect entire motifs within a DNA sequence, rather than individual bases. Motifs can also be detected from individually identified bases using a basecaller and then searching for motifs, however, such an approach is unnecessarily complex and slow. Building a machine learning model that directly identifies motifs allows to avoid the additional step of searching for motifs. It also makes use of the greater amount of features per motif, thus enabling finding the motifs with higher accuracy. Motif Caller significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of data retrieval in DNA storage based on Motif-Based DNA synthesis.</description>

      <title>Systematic evaluation of the isolated effect of tissue environment on the transcriptome using a single-cell RNA-seq atlas dataset</title>

Abstract: Background: Understanding cellular diversity throughout the body is essential for elucidating the complex functions of biological systems. Recently, large-scale single-cell omics datasets, known as omics atlases, have become available. These atlases encompass data from diverse tissues and cell-types, providing insights into the landscape of cell-type-specific gene expression. However, the isolated effect of the tissue environment has not been thoroughly investigated. Evaluating this isolated effect is challenging due to statistical confounding with cell-type effects, arising from significant biases in the combinations of tissues and cell-types within the body. Results: This study introduces a novel data analysis framework, named the Combinatorial Sub-dataset Extraction for Confounding Reduction (COSER), which addresses statistical confounding by using graph theory to enumerate appropriate sub-datasets. COSER enables the assessment of isolated effects of discrete variables in single cells. Applying COSER to the Tabula Muris Senis single-cell transcriptome atlas, we characterized the isolated impact of tissue environments. Our findings demonstrate that some of genes are markedly affected by the tissue environment, particularly in modulating intercellular diversity in immune responses and their age-related changes. Conclusion: COSER provides a robust, general-purpose framework for evaluating the isolated effects of discrete variables from large-scale data mining. This approach reveals critical insights into the interplay between tissue environments and gene expression.</description>

      <title>SHAP zero Explains Genomic Models with Near-zero Marginal Cost for Future Queried Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of large-scale machine learning models in genomics, Shapley values have emerged as a popular method for model explanations due to their theoretical guarantees. While Shapley values explain model predictions locally for an individual input query sequence, extracting biological knowledge requires global explanation across thousands of input sequences. This demands exponential model evaluations per sequence, resulting in significant computational cost and carbon footprint. Herein, we develop SHAP zero, a method that estimates Shapley values and interactions with a near-zero marginal cost for future queried sequences after paying a one-time fee for model sketching. SHAP zero achieves this by establishing a surprisingly underexplored connection between the Shapley values and interactions and the Fourier transform of the model. Explaining two genomic models, one trained to predict guide RNA binding and the other to predict DNA repair outcome, we demonstrate that SHAP zero achieves orders of magnitude reduction in amortized computational cost compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, revealing almost all predictive motifs -- a finding previously inaccessible due to the combinatorial space of possible interactions.</description>
