      <title>Convex Polygon Containment: Improving Quadratic to Near Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a standard polygon containment problem: given a convex $k$-gon $P$ and a convex $n$-gon $Q$ in the plane, find a placement of $P$ inside $Q$ under translation and rotation (if it exists), or more generally, find the largest copy of $P$ inside $Q$ under translation, rotation, and scaling.
  Previous algorithms by Chazelle (1983), Sharir and Toledo (1994), and Agarwal, Amenta, and Sharir (1998) all required $\Omega(n^2)$ time, even in the simplest $k=3$ case. We present a significantly faster new algorithm for $k=3$ achieving $O(n$polylog $n)$ running time. Moreover, we extend the result for general $k$, achieving $O(k^{O(1/\varepsilon)}n^{1+\varepsilon})$ running time for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$.
  Along the way, we also prove a new $O(k^{O(1)}n$polylog $n)$ bound on the number of similar copies of $P$ inside $Q$ that have 4 vertices of $P$ in contact with the boundary of $Q$ (assuming general position input), disproving a conjecture by Agarwal, Amenta, and Sharir (1998).</description>

      <title>Constrained and Ordered Level Planarity Parameterized by the Number of Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem Level Planarity asks for a crossing-free drawing of a graph in the plane such that vertices are placed at prescribed y-coordinates (called levels) and such that every edge is realized as a y-monotone curve. In the variant Constrained Level Planarity (CLP), each level $y$ is equipped with a partial order $\prec_y$ on its vertices and in the desired drawing the left-to-right order of vertices on level $y$ has to be a linear extension of $\prec_y$. Ordered Level Planarity (OLP) corresponds to the special case of CLP where the given partial orders $\prec_y$ are total orders. Previous results by Br\"uckner and Rutter [SODA 2017] and Klemz and Rote [ACM Trans. Alg. 2019] state that both CLP and OLP are NP-hard even in severely restricted cases. In particular, they remain NP-hard even when restricted to instances whose width (the maximum number of vertices that may share a common level) is at most two. In this paper, we focus on the other dimension: we study the parameterized complexity of CLP and OLP with respect to the height (the number of levels).
  We show that OLP parameterized by the height is complete with respect to the complexity class XNLP, which was first studied by Elberfeld et al. [Algorithmica 2015] (under a different name) and recently made more prominent by Bodlaender et al. [FOCS 2021]. It contains all parameterized problems that can be solved nondeterministically in time $f(k) n^{O(1)}$ and space $f(k) \log n$ (where $f$ is a computable function, $n$ is the input size, and $k$ is the parameter). If a problem is XNLP-complete, it lies in XP, but is W[$t$]-hard for every $t$.
  In contrast to the fact that OLP parameterized by the height lies in XP, it turns out that CLP is NP-hard even when restricted to instances of height 4. We complement this result by showing that CLP can be solved in polynomial time for instances of height at most 3.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Interleaving Distance for Mapper Graphs with a Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15130v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data consisting of a graph with a function mapping into $\R^d$ arise in many data applications, encompassing structures such as Reeb graphs, geometric graphs, and knot embeddings. As such, the ability to compare and cluster such objects is required in a data analysis pipeline, leading to a need for distances between them. In this work, we study the interleaving distance on discretization of these objects, $\R^d$-mapper graphs, where functor representations of the data can be compared by finding pairs of natural transformations between them. However, in many cases, computation of the interleaving distance is NP-hard. For this reason, we take inspiration from recent work by Robinson to find quality measures for families of maps that do not rise to the level of a natural transformation, called assignments. We then endow the functor images with the extra structure of a metric space and define a loss function which measures how far an assignment is from making the required diagrams of an interleaving commute. Finally we show that the computation of the loss function is polynomial with a given assignment. We believe this idea is both powerful and translatable, with the potential to provide approximations and bounds on interleavings in a broad array of contexts.</description>

      <title>Stability and Approximations for Decorated Reeb Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a map $f:X \to M$ from a topological space $X$ to a metric space $M$, a decorated Reeb space consists of the Reeb space, together with an attribution function whose values recover geometric information lost during the construction of the Reeb space. For example, when $M=\mathbb{R}$ is the real line, the Reeb space is the well-known Reeb graph, and the attributions may consist of persistence diagrams summarizing the level set topology of $f$. In this paper, we introduce decorated Reeb spaces in various flavors and prove that our constructions are Gromov-Hausdorff stable. We also provide results on approximating decorated Reeb spaces from finite samples and leverage these to develop a computational framework for applying these constructions to point cloud data.</description>
