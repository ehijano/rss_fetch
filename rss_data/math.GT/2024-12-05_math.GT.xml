      <title>How Many Links Fit in a Box?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an earlier note [arXiv:2301.00295] it was shown that there is an upper bound to the number of disjoint Hopf links (and certain related links) that can be imbedded in the unit cube where there is a fixed separation required between the components within each copy of the Hopf link. The arguments relied on multi-linear properties of linking number and certain other link invariants. Here we produce a very similar upper bound for all non-trivial links by a more-general, entirely geometric, argument (but one which, unlike the original, has no analog in higher dimensions). Shortly after the initial paper, [arXiv:2308.08064] proved that our upper bounds were also, effectively, lower bounds. Lower bounds are still open in the broader context.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of non-Euclidean Mass Center System and Generalized Pappus' Centroid Theorems in Three Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G.A. Galperin introduced the axiomatic mass center system for finite point sets in spherical and hyperbolic spaces, proving the uniqueness of the mass center system. In this paper, we revisit this system and provide a significantly simpler proof of its uniqueness. Furthermore, we extend the axiomatic mass center system to manifolds. As an application of our system, we derive a highly generalized version of Pappus' centroid theorem for volumes in three geometries - Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic - across all dimensions, offering unified and notably simple proofs for all three geometries.</description>

      <title>Hard diagrams of split links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformations of knots and links in ambient space can be studied combinatorially on their diagrams via local modifications called Reidemeister moves. While it is well-known that, in order to move between equivalent diagrams with Reidemeister moves, one sometimes needs to insert excess crossings, there are significant gaps between the best known lower and upper bounds on the required number of these added crossings. In this article, we study the problem of turning a diagram of a split link into a split diagram, and we show that there exist split links with diagrams requiring an arbitrarily large number of such additional crossings. More precisely, we provide a family of diagrams of split links, so that any sequence of Reidemeister moves transforming a diagram with $c$ crossings into a split diagram requires going through a diagram with $\Omega(\sqrt{c})$ extra crossings. Our proof relies on the framework of bubble tangles, as introduced by Lunel and de Mesmay, and a technique of Chambers and Liokumovitch to turn homotopies into isotopies in the context of Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>The Thurston norm of graph manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thurston norm of a closed oriented graph manifold is a sum of absolute values of linear functionals, and either each or none of the top-dimensional faces of its unit ball are fibered. We show that, conversely, every norm that can be written as a sum of absolute values of linear functionals with rational coefficients is the nonvanishing Thurston norm of some graph manifold, with respect to a rational basis on its second real homology. Moreover, we can choose such graph manifold either to fiber over the circle or not. In particular, every symmetric polygon with rational vertices is the unit polygon of the nonvanishing Thurston norm of a graph manifold fibering over the circle. In dimension $\ge 3$ many symmetric polyhedra with rational vertices are not realizable as nonvanishing Thurston norm ball of any graph manifold. However, given such a polyhedron, we show that there is always a graph manifold whose nonvanishing Thurston norm ball induces a finer partition into cones over the faces.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Trees and Exceptional Directions in FPP on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the geometry of infinite geodesics in first passage percolation (FPP) on Gromov-hyperbolic groups G, initiated by Benjamini-Tessera and developed further by the authors. It was shown earlier by the authors that, given any fixed direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and under mild conditions on the passage time distribution, there exists almost surely a unique semi-infinite FPP geodesic from each $v\in G$ to $\xi$. Also, these geodesics coalesce to form a tree. Our main topic of study is the set of (random) exceptional directions for which uniqueness or coalescence fails. We study these directions in the context of two random geodesics trees: one formed by the union of all geodesics starting at a given base point, and the other formed by the union of all semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction $\xi\in \partial G$. We show that, under mild conditions, the set of exceptional directions almost surely has a strictly smaller Hausdorff dimension than the boundary, and hence has measure zero with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. We also establish an upper bound on the maximum number of disjoint geodesics in the same direction. For groups that are not virtually free, we show that almost surely exceptional directions exist and are dense in $\partial G$. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is greater than one, we establish the existence of uncountably many exceptional directions. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is $n$, we prove the existence of directions $\xi$ with at least $(n+1)$ disjoint geodesics. The questions answered here have been considered before for FPP on euclidean lattices, but have only been satisfactorily answered for planar exactly solvable models of last passage percolation. Our results exhibit new features in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the long-time limit of the mean curvature flow in closed manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we show that generally almost regular flows, introduced by Bamler and Kleiner, in closed 3-manifolds will either go extinct in finite time or flow to a collection of smooth embedded minimal surfaces, possibly with multiplicity. Using a perturbative argument then we construct piecewise almost regular flows which either go extinct in finite time or flow to a stable minimal surface, possibly with multiplicity. We apply these results to construct minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds in a variety of circumstances, mainly novel from the point of the view that the arguments are via parabolic methods.</description>

      <title>The Thurston norm of 2-bridge link complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Thurston norm is a seminorm on the second real homology group of a compact orientable 3-manifold. The unit ball of this norm is a convex polyhedron, whose shape's data (e.g. number of vertices, regularity) measures the complexity of the surfaces sitting in the ambient 3-manifold.
  Unfortunately, the Thurston norm is generally quite hard to compute, and a long-standing problem is to understand which polyhedra are realised as the unit balls of the Thurston norms of $3$-manifolds. We show that, when $M$ is the complement of a $2$-bridge link $L$ with components $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, the Thurston ball of $M$ has at most 8 faces. The proof of this result strongly relies on a description of essential surfaces in $2$-bridge link complements given by Floyd and Hatcher. Then, we exhibit norm-minimizing representatives for the integral classes of $H_2(M,\partial M)$ and use them to compare the complexity of the Thurston ball with the complexities of $L$ and of $M$. As an example, we show that all the vertices of the Thurston ball lie on the bisectors if and only if $M$ fibers over the circle with fiber a surface with boundary equal to a longitude of $\ell_1$ and some meridians of $\ell_2$. Finally, we use $2$-bridge links in satellite constructions to find $2$-component links whose complements in $S^3$ have Thurston balls with arbitrarily many vertices.</description>

      <title>Generating Infinitely Many Hyperbolic Knots with Plats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the relationships between links in plat position, the dynamics of the braid group, and Heegaard splittings of double branched covers of $S^3$ over a link. These relationships offer new ways to view links in plat position and a new tool kit for analyzing links. In particular, we show that the Hempel distance of the Heegaard splitting of the double branched cover obtained from a plat is a lower bound for the Hempel distance of that plat. Using the Hempel distance of a knot in bridge position and pseudo-Anosov braids we obtain our main result: a construction of infinitely many sequences of prime hyperbolic $n$-bridge knots for $n \geq 3$, infinitely many of which are distinct. We consider known results to show that the knot genus and hyperbolic volume of these knots are bounded below by a linear function.</description>

Abstract: By leveraging techniques from complex analysis and topology, we have uncovered a remarkable property of branched covers and formulated a criterion for the existence of specific types of branched covers between 2-spheres. This criterion extends the findings previously reported by Jiang (2004), Pervova-Petronio (2006), Zhu (2019), and Wei-Wu-Xu (2024). Furthermore, as an application of our criterion, we introduce several novel exceptional branching datum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In my 1993 paper, "Pappus's Theorem and the Modular Group", I explained how the iteration of Pappus's Theorem gives rise to a $2$-parameter family of representations of the modular group into the group of projective automorphisms. In this paper we realize these representations as isometry groups of patterns of geodesics in the symmetric space $X=SL_3(\R)/SO(3)$. The patterns have the same asymptotic structure as the geodesics in the Farey triangulation, so our construction gives a $2$ parameter family of deformations of the Farey triangulation inside $X$. We also describe a bending phenomenon associated to these patterns.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for Tambara-Yamagami quantum invariants of 3-manifolds, parameterized by the first Betti number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum topology provides various frameworks for defining and computing invariants of manifolds inspired by quantum theory. One such framework of substantial interest in both mathematics and physics is the Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury state sum construction, which uses the data of a spherical fusion category to define topological invariants of triangulated 3-manifolds via tensor network contractions. In this work we analyze the computational complexity of state sum invariants of 3-manifolds derived from Tambara-Yamagami categories. While these categories are the simplest source of state sum invariants beyond finite abelian groups (whose invariants can be computed in polynomial time) their computational complexities are yet to be fully understood. We first establish that the invariants arising from even the smallest Tambara-Yamagami categories are #P-hard to compute, so that one expects the same to be true of the whole family. Our main result is then the existence of a fixed parameter tractable algorithm to compute these 3-manifold invariants, where the parameter is the first Betti number of the 3-manifold with Z/2Z coefficients.
  Contrary to other domains of computational topology, such as graphs on surfaces, very few hard problems in 3-manifold topology are known to admit FPT algorithms with a topological parameter. However, such algorithms are of particular interest as their complexity depends only polynomially on the combinatorial representation of the input, regardless of size or combinatorial width. Additionally, in the case of Betti numbers, the parameter itself is computable in polynomial time. Thus while one generally expects quantum invariants to be hard to compute classically, our results suggest that the hardness of computing state sum invariants from Tambara-Yamagami categories arises from classical 3-manifold topology rather than the quantum nature of the algebraic input.</description>

      <title>Tubes and Steklov eigenvalues in negatively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Steklov eigenvalue problem on a compact pinched negatively curved manifold $M$ of dimension at least three with totally geodesic boundaries. We obtain a geometric lower bound for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue in terms of the total volume of $M$ and the volume of its boundary. We provide examples illustrating the necessity of these geometric quantities in the lower bound. Our result can be seen as a counterpart of the lower bound for the first nonzero Laplace eigenvalue on closed pinched negatively curved manifolds of dimension at least three proved by Schoen in 1982.
  The proof is composed of certain key elements. We provide a uniform lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Steklov-Dirichlet problem on a neighborhood of the boundary of $M$ and show that it provides an obstruction to having a small first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue. As another key element of the proof, we give a tubular neighborhood theorem for totally geodesic hypersurfaces in a pinched negatively curved manifold. We give an explicit dependence for the width function in terms of the volume of the boundary and the pinching constant.</description>
