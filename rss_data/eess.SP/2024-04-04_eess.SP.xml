      <title>Kalman filter based localization in hybrid BLE-UWB positioning system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a concept of hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning system is presented. The system is intended to be energy efficient. Low energy BLE unit is used as a primary source of measurement data and for most of the time localization is calculated based on received signal strength (RSS). UWB technology is used less often. Time difference of arrival (TDOA) values measured with UWB radios are periodically used to improve RSS based localization. The paper contains a description of proposed hybrid positioning algorithm. Results of simulations and experiments confirming algorithm's efficiency are also included.</description>

      <title>GNSS Spoofing Detection by Crowdsourcing Double Differential Pseudorange Spatial Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely known that spoofing is a major threat that adversely impacts the reliability and accuracy of GNSS applications. In this study, a crowdsourcing double differential pseudorange spatial (D2SP) random set is constructed and the distribution of the set is derived.Based on the variance of the D2SP set, a tri-level hypothesis detection algorithm is designed to classify spoofing-free, fully-spoofed, and partially-spoofed cases in the region of interest (ROI).It does not require the prior knowledge of the truth positions or relative distances of the receivers.Simulation test results show that the proposed D2SP spoofing detection method has the advantages of lower computational complexity and higher tolerance for multipath errors compared with the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) method that is the current mainstream spoofing detection algorithm based on multiple receivers' differential pseudoranges.Moreover, it also shows better flexibility for different sizes of ROI and numbers of the crowdsourcing receivers.</description>

      <title>SSwsrNet: A Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning Framework for Wireless Signal Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless signal recognition (WSR) is crucial in modern and future wireless communication networks since it aims to identify properties of the received signal. Although many deep learning-based WSR models have been developed, they still rely on a large amount of labeled training data. Thus, they cannot tackle the few-sample problem in the practically and dynamically changing wireless communication environment. To overcome this challenge, a novel SSwsrNet framework is proposed by using the deep residual shrinkage network (DRSN) and semi-supervised learning. The DRSN can learn discriminative features from noisy signals. Moreover, a modular semi-supervised learning method that combines labeled and unlabeled data using MixMatch is exploited to further improve the classification performance under few-sample conditions. Extensive simulation results on automatic modulation classification (AMC) and wireless technology classification (WTC) demonstrate that our proposed WSR scheme can achieve better performance than the benchmark schemes in terms of classification accuracy. This novel method enables more robust and adaptive signal recognition for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sum-Rate Performance in Constrained Multicell Networks: A Low-Information Exchange Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the extensive research on massive MIMO systems for 5G telecommunications and beyond, the reality is that many deployed base stations are equipped with a limited number of antennas rather than supporting massive MIMO configurations. Furthermore, while the cell-less network concept, which eliminates cell boundaries, is under investigation, practical deployments often grapple with significantly limited backhaul connection capacities between base stations. This letter explores techniques to maximize the sum-rate performance within the constraints of these more realistically equipped multicell networks. We propose an innovative approach that dramatically reduces the need for information exchange between base stations to a mere few bits, in stark contrast to conventional methods that require the exchange of hundreds of bits. Our proposed method not only addresses the limitations imposed by current network infrastructure but also showcases significantly improved performance under these constrained conditions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Graphical Lasso: Learning Edges from Gaussian Graph-Stationary Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Polynomial Graphical Lasso (PGL), a new approach to learning graph structures from nodal signals. Our key contribution lies in modeling the signals as Gaussian and stationary on the graph, enabling the development of a graph-learning formulation that combines the strengths of graphical lasso with a more encompassing model. Specifically, we assume that the precision matrix can take any polynomial form of the sought graph, allowing for increased flexibility in modeling nodal relationships. Given the resulting complexity and nonconvexity of the resulting optimization problem, we (i) propose a low-complexity algorithm that alternates between estimating the graph and precision matrices, and (ii) characterize its convergence. We evaluate the performance of PGL through comprehensive numerical simulations using both synthetic and real data, demonstrating its superiority over several alternatives. Overall, this approach presents a significant advancement in graph learning and holds promise for various applications in graph-aware signal analysis and beyond.</description>

      <title>Ground-to-UAV 140 GHz channel measurement and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted terahertz (THz) wireless communications have been expected to play a vital role in the next generation of wireless networks. UAVs can serve as either repeaters or data collectors within the communication link, thereby potentially augmenting the efficacy of communication systems. Despite their promise, the channel analysis and modeling specific to THz wireless channels leveraging UAVs remain under explored. This work delves into a ground-to-UAV channel at 140 GHz, with a specific focus on the influence of UAV hovering behavior on channel performance. Employing experimental measurements through an unmodulated channel setup and a geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) that integrates three-dimensional positional coordinates and beamwidth, this work evaluates the impact of UAV dynamic movements and antenna orientation on channel performance. Our findings highlight the minimal impact of UAV orientation adjustments on channel performance and underscore the diminishing necessity for precise alignment between UAVs and ground stations as beamwidth increases.</description>

      <title>Multi-Polarization Superposition Beamforming: Novel Scheme of Transmit Power Allocation and Subcarrier Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 5th generation (5G) new radio (NR) access technology and the beyond-5G future wireless communication require extremely high data rate and spectrum efficiency. Energy-efficient transmission/reception schemes are also regarded as an important component. The polarization domain has attracted substantial attention in this aspects. This paper is the first to propose \textit{multi-polarization superposition beamforming (MPS-Beamforming)} with cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and cross-polarization ratio (XPR)-aware transmit power allocation utilizing the 5G NR antenna panel structure. The appropriate orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarrier assignment algorithm is also proposed to verify the theoretical schemes via simulations. The detailed theoretical derivation along with comprehensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed novel scheme of MPS-Beamforming is significantly beneficial to the improvement of the performance in terms of the symbol error rate (SER) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain at the user equipment (UE). For instance, a provided practical wireless channel environment in the simulations exhibits 8 dB SNR gain for $10^{-4}$ SER in a deterministic channel, and 4 dB SNR gain for $10^{-5}$ SER in abundant statistical channel realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The technological landscape is swiftly advancing towards large-scale systems, creating significant opportunities, particularly in the domain of Terahertz (THz) communications. Networks designed for massive connectivity, comprising numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices, are at the forefront of this advancement. In this paper, we consider Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-enabled networks that support these IoT devices with massive Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (mURLLC) services.The focus of such networks is information freshness, with the Age-of-Information (AoI) serving as the pivotal performance metric. In particular, we aim to minimize the maximum AoI among IoT devices by optimizing the scheduling policy. Our analytical findings establish the convexity property of the problem, which can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of AoI-oriented cluster capacity, examining the relationship between the number of supported devices and the AoI performance in the network. Numerical simulations validate the advantage of our proposed approach in enhancing AoI performance, indicating its potential to guide the design of future THz communication systems for IoT applications requiring mURLLC services.</description>

      <title>Energy Allocation for Multi-User Cooperative Molecular Communication Systems in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative molecular communication (MC) is a promising technology for facilitating communication between nanomachines in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) field. However, the performance of IoBNT is limited by the availability of energy for cooperative MC. This paper presents a novel transmitter design scheme that utilizes molecule movement between reservoirs, creating concentration differences through the consumption of free energy, and encoding information on molecule types. The performance of the transmitter is primarily influenced by energy costs, which directly impact the overall IoBNT system performance. To address this, the paper focuses on optimizing energy allocation in cooperative MC for enhanced transmitter performance. Theoretical analysis is conducted for two transmitters. For scenarios with more than two users, a genetic algorithm is employed in the energy allocation to minimize the total bit error rate (BER). Finally, numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed energy allocation strategies in the considered cooperative MC system.</description>

      <title>On the Efficiency and Robustness of Vibration-based Foundation Models for IoT Sensing: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the potential of vibration-based Foundation Models (FMs), pre-trained with unlabeled sensing data, to improve the robustness of run-time inference in (a class of) IoT applications. A case study is presented featuring a vehicle classification application using acoustic and seismic sensing. The work is motivated by the success of foundation models in the areas of natural language processing and computer vision, leading to generalizations of the FM concept to other domains as well, where significant amounts of unlabeled data exist that can be used for self-supervised pre-training. One such domain is IoT applications. Foundation models for selected sensing modalities in the IoT domain can be pre-trained in an environment-agnostic fashion using available unlabeled sensor data and then fine-tuned to the deployment at hand using a small amount of labeled data. The paper shows that the pre-training/fine-tuning approach improves the robustness of downstream inference and facilitates adaptation to different environmental conditions. More specifically, we present a case study in a real-world setting to evaluate a simple (vibration-based) FM-like model, called FOCAL, demonstrating its superior robustness and adaptation, compared to conventional supervised deep neural networks (DNNs). We also demonstrate its superior convergence over supervised solutions. Our findings highlight the advantages of vibration-based FMs (and FM-inspired selfsupervised models in general) in terms of inference robustness, runtime efficiency, and model adaptation (via fine-tuning) in resource-limited IoT settings.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Unsupervised Deep Learning for Robust Joint AP Clustering and Beamforming Design in Cell-Free Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider robust joint access point (AP) clustering and beamforming design with imperfect channel state information (CSI) in cell-free systems. Specifically, we jointly optimize AP clustering and beamforming with imperfect CSI to simultaneously maximize the worst-case sum rate and minimize the number of AP clustering under power constraint and the sparsity constraint of AP clustering. By transformations, the semi-infinite constraints caused by the imperfect CSI are converted into more tractable forms for facilitating a computationally efficient unsupervised deep learning algorithm. In addition, to further reduce the computational complexity, a computationally effective unsupervised deep learning algorithm is proposed to implement robust joint AP clustering and beamforming design with imperfect CSI in cell-free systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised deep learning algorithm achieves a higher worst-case sum rate under a smaller number of AP clustering with computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Terahertz channel modeling based on surface sensing characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of environmental surfaces, including walls, floors and the ground, etc., play a crucial role in shaping the accuracy of terahertz (THz) channel modeling, thereby directly impacting the effectiveness of communication systems. Traditionally, acquiring these properties has relied on methods such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) or vector network analyzers (VNA), demanding rigorous sample preparation and entailing a significant expenditure of time. However, such measurements are not always feasible, particularly in novel and uncharacterized scenarios. In this work, we propose a new approach for channel modeling that leverages the inherent sensing capabilities of THz channels. By comparing the results obtained through channel sensing with that derived from THz-TDS measurements, we demonstrate the method's ability to yield dependable surface property information. The application of this approach in both a miniaturized cityscape scenario and an indoor environment has shown consistency with experimental measurements, thereby verifying its effectiveness in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Wideband Beamforming for Near-Field Communications with Circular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The beamforming performance of the uniform circular array (UCA) in near-field wideband communication systems is investigated. Compared to uniform linear array (ULA), UCA exhibits uniform effective array aperture in all directions, thus enabling more users to benefit from near-field communications. In this paper, the unique beam squint effect in near-field wideband UCA systems is comprehensively analyzed in both the distance and angular domains. It is rigorously demonstrated that the beam focal point only exists at a specific frequency in wideband UCA systems, resulting in significant beamforming loss. To alleviate this unique beam squint effect, the true-time delay (TTD)-based beamforming architecture is exploited. In particular, two wideband beamforming optimization approaches leveraging TTD units are proposed. 1) Analytical approach: In this approach, the phase shifters (PSs) and the time delay of TTD units are designed based on the analytical formula for beamforming gain. Following this design, the minimum number of TTD units required to achieve a predetermined beamforming gain is quantified. 2) Joint-optimization approach: In this method, the PSs and the TTD units are jointly optimized under practical maximum delay constraints to approximate the optimal unconstrained analog beamformer. Specifically, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where the PSs and the TTD units are alternately updated using either the closed-form solution or the low-complexity linear search approach. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed beamforming schemes effectively mitigate the beam squint effect, and 2) the joint-optimization approach outperforms the analytical approach in terms of array gain and achievable spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Power Doppler Using Null Subtraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To improve the spatial resolution of power Doppler (PD) imaging, we explored null subtraction imaging (NSI) as an alternative beamforming technique to delay-and-sum (DAS). NSI is a nonlinear beamforming approach that uses three different apodizations on receive and incoherently sums the beamformed envelopes. NSI uses a null in the beam pattern to improve the lateral resolution, which we apply here for improving PD spatial resolution both with and without contrast microbubbles. In this study, we used NSI with three types of singular value decomposition (SVD)-based clutter filters and noise equalization to generate high-resolution PD images. An element sensitivity correction scheme was also proposed as a crucial component of NSI-based PD imaging. First, a microbubble trace experiment was performed to evaluate the resolution improvement of NSI-based PD over traditional DAS-based PD. Then, both contrast-enhanced and contrast free ultrasound PD images were generated from the scan of a rat brain. The cross-sectional profile of the microbubble traces and microvessels were plotted. FWHM was also estimated to provide a quantitative metric. Furthermore, iso-frequency curves were calculated to provide a resolution evaluation metric over the global field of view. Up to six-fold resolution improvement was demonstrated by the FWHM estimate and four-fold resolution improvement was demonstrated by the iso-frequency curve from the NSI-based PD microvessel images compared to microvessel images generated by traditional DAS-based beamforming. A resolvability of 39 um was measured from the NSI-based PD microvessel image. The computational cost of NSI-based PD was only increased by 40 percent over the DAS-based PD.</description>

      <title>Plug-In RIS: A Novel Approach to Fully Passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a promising design concept for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), named plug-in RIS, wherein the RIS is plugged into an appropriate position in the environment, adjusted once according to the location of both base station and blocked region, and operates with fixed beams to enhance the system performance. The plug-in RIS is a novel system design, streamlining RIS-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication without requiring decoupling two parts of the end-to-end channel, traditional control signal transmission, and online RIS configuration. In plug-in RIS-aided transmission, the transmitter efficiently activates specific regions of the divided large RIS by employing hybrid beamforming techniques, each with predetermined phase adjustments tailored to reflect signals to desired user locations. This user-centric approach enhances connectivity and overall user experience by dynamically illuminating the targeted user based on location. By introducing plug-in RIS's theoretical framework, design principles, and performance evaluation, we demonstrate its potential to revolutionize mmWave communications for the limited channel state information (CSI) scenarios. Simulation results illustrate that plug-in RIS provides power/cost-efficient solutions to overcome blockage in the mmWave communication system and a striking convergence in average bit error rate and achievable rate performance with traditional full CSI-enabled RIS solutions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence approach to probabilistic forecasting of electricity market signals, such as real-time locational marginal prices and area control error signals. Inspired by the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a novel deep learning algorithm that extracts the canonical independent and identically distributed innovation sequence of the time series, from which future time series samples are generated. The validity of the proposed approach is established by proving that, under ideal training conditions, the generated samples have the same conditional probability distribution as that of the ground truth. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for self-scheduled resources such as battery storage participants, (ii) interregional price spread forecasting for virtual bidders in interchange markets, and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed generative forecaster over leading classical and modern machine learning techniques under both probabilistic and point forecasting metrics.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Split Computing with Wake-Up Radios: Architecture and Design via Digital Twinning</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing leverages the sparsity of temporal data to reduce processing energy by activating a small subset of neurons and synapses at each time step. When deployed for split computing in edge-based systems, remote neuromorphic processing units (NPUs) can reduce the communication power budget by communicating asynchronously using sparse impulse radio (IR) waveforms. This way, the input signal sparsity translates directly into energy savings both in terms of computation and communication. However, with IR transmission, the main contributor to the overall energy consumption remains the power required to maintain the main radio on. This work proposes a novel architecture that integrates a wake-up radio mechanism within a split computing system consisting of remote, wirelessly connected, NPUs. A key challenge in the design of a wake-up radio-based neuromorphic split computing system is the selection of thresholds for sensing, wake-up signal detection, and decision making. To address this problem, as a second contribution, this work proposes a novel methodology that leverages the use of a digital twin (DT), i.e., a simulator, of the physical system, coupled with a sequential statistical testing approach known as Learn Then Test (LTT) to provide theoretical reliability guarantees. The proposed DT-LTT methodology is broadly applicable to other design problems, and is showcased here for neuromorphic communications. Experimental results validate the design and the analysis, confirming the theoretical reliability guarantees and illustrating trade-offs among reliability, energy consumption, and informativeness of the decisions.</description>

      <title>Antenna Selection in Polarization Reconfigurable MIMO (PR-MIMO) Communication Systems</title>

Abstract: Adaptation of a wireless system to the polarization state of the propagation channel can improve reliability and throughput. This paper in particular considers polarization reconfigurable multiple input multiple output (PR-MIMO) systems, where both transmitter and receiver can change the (linear) polarization orientation at each element of their antenna arrays. We first introduce joint polarization pre-post coding to maximize bounds on the capacity and the maximum eigenvalue of the channel matrix. For this we first derive approximate closed form equations of optimal polarization vectors at one link end, and then use iterative joint polarization pre-post coding to pursue joint optimal polarization vectors at both link ends. Next we investigate the combination of PR-MIMO with hybrid antenna selection / maximum ratio transmission (PR-HS/MRT), which can achieve a remarkable improvement of channel capacity and symbol error rate (SER). Further, two novel schemes of element wise and global polarization reconfiguration are presented for PR-HS/MRT. Comprehensive simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes provide 3 to 5 dB SNR gain in PR-MIMO spatial multiplexing and approximately 3 dB SNR gain in PRHS/ MRT, with concomitant improvements of channel capacity and SER.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Wireless Communication: Modeling and Physical Layer Aspects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for wireless communications have a local position-dependent (phase-gradient) scattering response on the surface. We consider more general RIS structures, called nonlocal (or redirective) RIS, that are capable of selectively manipulate the impinging waves depending on the incident angle. Redirective RIS have nonlocal wavefront-selective scattering behavior and can be implemented using multilayer arrays such as metalenses. We demonstrate that this more sophisticated type of surfaces has several advantages such as: lower overhead through coodebook-based reconfigurability, decoupled wave manipulations, and higher efficiency in multiuser scenarios via multifunctional operation. Additionally, redirective RIS architectures greatly benefit form the directional nature of wave propagation at high frequencies and can support integrated fronthaul and access (IFA) networks most efficiently. We also discuss the scalability and compactness issues and propose efficient nonlocal RIS architectures such as fractionated lens-based RIS and mirror-backed phase-masks structures that do not require additional control complexity and overhead while still offering better performance than conventional local RIS.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Maximum Power Association Policy for Cellular Networks Using Distance and Angular Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel stochastic geometry framework is proposed in this paper to study the downlink coverage performance in a millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular network by jointly considering the polar coordinates of the Base Stations (BSs) with respect to the typical user located at the origin. Specifically, both the Euclidean and the angular distances of the BSs in a maximum power-based association policy for the UE are considered to account for realistic beam management considerations, which have been largely ignored in the literature, especially in the cell association phase. For completeness, two other association schemes are considered and exact-form expressions for the coverage probability are derived. Subsequently, the key role of angular distances is highlighted by defining the dominant interferer using angular distance-based criteria instead of Euclidean distance-based, and conducting a dominant interferer-based coverage probability analysis. Among others, the numerical results revealed that considering angular distance-based criteria for determining both the serving and the dominant interfering BS, can approximate the coverage performance more accurately as compared to utilizing Euclidean distance-based criteria. To the best of the authors$'$ knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously explores the role of angular distances in the association policy and analysis of cellular networks.</description>

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of stress-related eating behaviors and their impact on overall health highlights the importance of effective and ubiquitous monitoring systems. In this paper, we present MeciFace, an innovative wearable technology designed to monitor facial expressions and eating activities in real-time on-the-edge (RTE). MeciFace aims to provide a low-power, privacy-conscious, and highly accurate tool for promoting healthy eating behaviors and stress management. We employ lightweight convolutional neural networks as backbone models for facial expression and eating monitoring scenarios. The MeciFace system ensures efficient data processing with a tiny memory footprint, ranging from 11KB to 19 KB. During RTE evaluation, the system achieves an F1-score of &lt; 86% for facial expression recognition and 94% for eating/drinking monitoring, for the RTE of unseen users (user-independent case).</description>

      <title>Chaotic Waveform-based Signal Design for Noncoherent SWIPT Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a chaotic waveform-based multi-antenna receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Particularly, we present a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based SWIPT multiantenna receiver architecture, where each antenna switches between information transfer (IT) and energy harvesting (EH) modes depending on the receiver's requirements. We take into account a generalized frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading model as well as the nonlinearities of the EH process to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the associated bit error rate (BER) and the harvested direct current (DC), respectively. We show that, both depend on the parameters of the transmitted waveform and the number of receiver antennas being utilized in the IT and EH mode. We investigate a trade-off in terms of the BER and energy transfer by introducing a novel achievable `success rate - harvested energy' region. Moreover, we demonstrate that energy and information transfer are two conflicting tasks and hence, a single waveform cannot be simultaneously optimal for both IT and EH. Accordingly, we propose appropriate transmit waveform designs based on the application specific requirements of acceptable BER or harvested DC or both. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of chaotic waveform-based signal design and its impact on the proposed receiver architecture.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Near-Field XL-MIMO Communications Towards 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technology for the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks. By significantly boosting the antenna number or size to at least an order of magnitude beyond current massive MIMO systems, XL-MIMO is expected to unprecedentedly enhance the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution for wireless communication. The evolution from massive MIMO to XL-MIMO is not simply an increase in the array size, but faces new design challenges, in terms of near-field channel modelling, performance analysis, channel estimation, and practical implementation. In this article, we give a comprehensive tutorial overview on near-field XL-MIMO communications, aiming to provide useful guidance for tackling the above challenges. First, the basic near-field modelling for XL-MIMO is established, by considering the new characteristics of non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) and spatial non-stationarity. Next, based on the near-field modelling, the performance analysis of XL-MIMO is presented, including the near-field signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling laws, beam focusing pattern, achievable rate, and degrees-of-freedom (DoF). Furthermore, various XL-MIMO design issues such as near-field beam codebook, beam training, channel estimation, and delay alignment modulation (DAM) transmission are elaborated. Finally, we point out promising directions to inspire future research on near-field XL-MIMO communications.</description>

      <title>Multivariate selfsimilarity: Multiscale eigen-structures for selfsimilarity parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale-free dynamics, formalized by selfsimilarity, provides a versatile paradigm massively and ubiquitously used to model temporal dynamics in real-world data. However, its practical use has mostly remained univariate so far. By contrast, modern applications often demand multivariate data analysis. Accordingly, models for multivariate selfsimilarity were recently proposed. Nevertheless, they have remained rarely used in practice because of a lack of available robust estimation procedures for the vector of selfsimilarity parameters. Building upon recent mathematical developments, the present work puts forth an efficient estimation procedure based on the theoretical study of the multiscale eigenstructure of the wavelet spectrum of multivariate selfsimilar processes. The estimation performance is studied theoretically in the asymptotic limits of large scale and sample sizes, and computationally for finite-size samples. As a practical outcome, a fully operational and documented multivariate signal processing estimation toolbox is made freely available and is ready for practical use on real-world data. Its potential benefits are illustrated in epileptic seizure prediction from multi-channel EEG data.</description>

      <title>Refining Myocardial Infarction Detection: A Novel Multi-Modal Composite Kernel Strategy in One-Class Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early detection of myocardial infarction (MI), a critical condition arising from coronary artery disease (CAD), is vital to prevent further myocardial damage. This study introduces a novel method for early MI detection using a one-class classification (OCC) algorithm in echocardiography. Our study overcomes the challenge of limited echocardiography data availability by adopting a novel approach based on Multi-modal Subspace Support Vector Data Description. The proposed technique involves a specialized MI detection framework employing multi-view echocardiography incorporating a composite kernel in the non-linear projection trick, fusing Gaussian and Laplacian sigmoid functions. Additionally, we enhance the update strategy of the projection matrices by adapting maximization for both or one of the modalities in the optimization process. Our method boosts MI detection capability by efficiently transforming features extracted from echocardiography data into an optimized lower-dimensional subspace. The OCC model trained specifically on target class instances from the comprehensive HMC-QU dataset that includes multiple echocardiography views indicates a marked improvement in MI detection accuracy. Our findings reveal that our proposed multi-view approach achieves a geometric mean of 71.24%, signifying a substantial advancement in echocardiography-based MI diagnosis and offering more precise and efficient diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic positioning via ray tracing with noisy angle of arrival measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the positioning problem in non line-of-sight (NLoS) situations, where several base stations (BS) try to locate a user equipment (UE) based on uplink angle of arrival (AoA) measurements and a digital twin of the environment. Ray launching in a Monte Carlo manner according to the AoA statistics enables to produce a map of points for each BS. These points represent the intersections of the rays with a xy plane at a given user equipment (UE) elevation. We propose to fit a parametric probability density function (pdf), such as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), to each map of points. Multiplying the obtained pdfs for each BS enables to compute the position probability of the UE. This approach yields an algorithm robust to a reduced number of launched rays. Moreover, these parametric pdfs may be fitted and stored in an offline phase such that ray tracing can be avoided in the online phase. This significantly reduces the computational complexity of the positioning method.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Antenna Users and Phase Misalignments: A Novel Partially Coherent Transmission Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a promising technology for next-generation communication systems. This work proposes a novel partially coherent (PC) transmission framework to cope with the challenge of phase misalignment among the access points (APs), which is important for unlocking the full potential of cell-free massive MIMO technology. With the PC operation, the APs are only required to be phase-aligned within clusters. Each cluster transmits the same data stream towards each user equipment (UE), while different clusters send different data streams. We first propose a novel algorithm to group APs into clusters such that the distance between two APs is always smaller than a reference distance ensuring the phase alignment of these APs. Then, we propose new algorithms that optimize the combining at UEs and precoding at APs to maximize the downlink sum data rates. We also propose a novel algorithm for data stream allocation to further improve the sum data rate of the PC operation. Numerical results show that the PC operation using the proposed framework with a sufficiently small reference distance can offer a sum rate close to the sum rate of the ideal fully coherent (FC) operation that requires network-wide phase alignment. This demonstrates the potential of PC operation in practical deployments of cell-free massive MIMO networks.</description>

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms usually {force} reduction in data utility by producing "out-of-bound" noisy results for a tight privacy budget. We introduce the Budget Recycling Differential Privacy (BR-DP) framework, designed to provide soft-bounded noisy outputs for a broad range of existing DP mechanisms. By "soft-bounded," we refer to the mechanism's ability to release most outputs within a predefined error boundary, thereby improving utility and maintaining privacy simultaneously. The core of BR-DP consists of two components: a DP kernel responsible for generating a noisy answer per iteration, and a recycler that probabilistically recycles/regenerates or releases the noisy answer. We delve into the privacy accounting of BR-DP, culminating in the development of a budgeting principle that optimally sub-allocates the available budget between the DP kernel and the recycler. Furthermore, we introduce algorithms for tight BR-DP accounting in composition scenarios, and our findings indicate that BR-DP achieves reduced privacy leakage post-composition compared to DP. Additionally, we explore the concept of privacy amplification via subsampling within the BR-DP framework and propose optimal sampling rates for BR-DP across various queries. We experiment with real data, and the results demonstrate BR-DP's effectiveness in lifting the utility-privacy tradeoff provided by DP mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of movable antenna (MA) assistance for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel. We exploit an additional design degree of freedom provided by MA to enhance the desired signal and suppress interference so as to reduce the total transmit power of interference network. To this end, we jointly optimize the MA positions and transmit beamforming, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints of users. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to alternately optimize the MA positions via successive convex approximation method and the transmit beamforming via second-order cone program approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enabled MISO interference network outperforms its conventional counterpart without MA, which significantly enhances the capability of inter-cell frequency reuse and reduces the complexity of transmitter design.</description>

      <title>Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.</description>
