      <title>A note on the admissibility of smooth simple $RG$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a $p$-adic reductive group and $R$ be a noetherian Jacobson $\mathbb{Z}[1/p]$-algebra. In this note, we show that every smooth irreducible $R$-linear representation of $G$ is admissible using the finiteness result of Dat, Helm, Kurinczuk and Moss for Hecke algebras over $R$.</description>

      <title>Odd Khovanov homology, higher representation theory and higher rewriting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis is devoted to the fields of quantum topology and rewriting theory, and their surprising interconnections. In the first part of the thesis, we develop a higher representation theoretic approach to odd Khovanov homology; this is the content of arXiv:2311.14394. One of the essential ingredients is a certain graded-2-category of graded $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams. In the second part of the thesis, we develop a rewriting theory suitable for higher algebras and their super or graded analogues, and use it to show a basis theorem for graded $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams. These techniques have the potential to be applied to a wide variety of contexts. Both parts of the thesis can be read independently. Each has its own comprehensive introduction, allowing experts from one field to get acquainted with the other field.</description>

      <title>On representations of Arthur type and unitary dual for classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, towards the unitary dual problem for classical groups, we propose a refinement of a conjecture of M. Tadi\'c: A representation of good parity is unitary if and only if it is of Arthur type; and a conjectural description of the whole unitary dual. We verify them for representations of corank at most $3$ for symplectic or split odd special orthogonal groups, based on Tadi\'c's classification. To this end, we develop new algorithms to determine whether a given irreducible representation is of Arthur type and give an inductive approach to classify the family of unitary representations that are of Arthur type. As applications, we carry out the explicit list on representations of Arthur type with corank at most $3$, and classify several new families of representations of Arthur type.</description>

      <title>Splitting rational incomplete Mackey functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by equivariant homotopy theory, equivariant algebra studies generalisations of G-Mackey functors that do not have all transfer maps (also known as induction maps), for G a finite group. These incomplete Mackey functors have interesting and subtle properties that are more complicated than classical algebra. The levels of incompleteness that occur are indexed by simple combinatorial data known as transfers systems for G, which are refinements of the subgroup relation satisfying certain axioms. The aim of this paper is to generalise the Greenlees-May and Thevenaz-Webb splitting result of rational G-Mackey functors to the incomplete case.
  By calculating idempotents of the rational incomplete Burnside ring of G, we find maximal splitting of the category of rational incomplete G-Mackey functors. These splittings are determined by maps of the form (H to G) in the transfer system. We give an intrinsic definition of the split pieces beyond the idempotent description in order to understand what is the minimal information needed to determine an arbitrary rational incomplete G-Mackey functor. We end the paper with a series of examples of possible splittings and illustrate how simpler transfer systems have fewer terms in the splitting but the split pieces are more complicated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite group $G$ is called uniformly semi-rational if there exists an integer $r$ such that the generators of every cyclic sugroup $\langle x \rangle$ of $G$ lie in at most two conjugacy classes, namely $x^G$ or $(x^r)^G$. In this paper, we provide a classification of uniformly semi-rational non-abelian simple groups with particular focus on alternating groups.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Deformation quantization and Geometric quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the quantization of K\"ahler manifolds, focusing on the relationship between deformation quantization and geometric quantization. We provide a classification of degree 1 formal quantizable functions in the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization, establishing that these formal functions are of the form $f = f_0 - \frac{\hbar}{4\pi}(\Delta f_0 + c)$ for a certain smooth (non-formal) function $f_0$. If $f_0$ is real-valued then $f_0$ corresponds to a Hamiltonian Killing vector field. In the presence of Hamiltonian $G$-symmetry, we address the compatibility between the infinitesimal symmetry for deformation quantization via quantum moment map and infinitesimal symmetry on geometric quantization acting on Hilbert spaces of holomorphic sections via Berezin-Toeplitz quantization.</description>

      <title>On two notions of total positivity for generalized partial flag varieties of classical Lie types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For Grassmannians, Lusztig's notion of total positivity coincides with positivity of the Plucker coordinates. This coincidence underpins the rich interaction between matroid theory, tropical geometry, and the theory of total positivity. Bloch and Karp furthermore characterized the (type A) partial flag varieties for which the two notions positivity similarly coincide. We characterize the symplectic (type C) and odd-orthogonal (type B) partial flag varieties for which Lusztig's total positivity coincides with Plucker positivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an exact functor from the category of Harish-Chandra modules of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$ to the category of finite-dimensional modules of graded Hecke algebras of type A. We show that the functor preserves parabolically induced modules, standard modules, irreducible modules, unitary modules and Dirac series. We also use the functor to connect a Bernstein-Zelevinsky type functor for graded Hecke algebra side to the tensor product for $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)$ side. Some applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Ennola duality for decomposition of tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate Ennola duality for decomposition of tensor products of irreducible characters of finite general linear groups and finite unitary groups. We prove that Ennola duality holds generically and give a geometric interpretation using the cohomology of quiver varieties. For non-generic characters (like unipotent characters), Ennola duality does not work just by replacing q by -q. We construct two-variable polynomials that interpolate multiplicities for finite general linear groups and finite unitary groups in the unipotent case (which can be considered as Ennola duality).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18821v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the present work is to systematically study homomorphisms of Hecke and Artin monoids and thus to develop their comprehensive theory. Our original motivation was the striking observation that parabolic projections of Hecke monoids respect all parabolic elements. We found other classes of homomorphisms of Hecke monoids with the same property and discovered that many of them lift to homomorphisms of covering Artin monoids with a similar property. It turned out that they belong to a much larger class (in fact, a category) of homomorphisms of Artin monoids, most of which appear to be new.</description>

      <title>A study of nil Hecke algebras via Hopf algebroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hopf algebroids are generalizations of Hopf algebras to less commutative settings. We show how the comultiplication defined by Kostant and Kumar turns the affine nil Hecke algebra associated to a Coxeter system into a Hopf algebroid without an antipode. The proof relies on mixed dihedral braid relations between Demazure operators and simple reflections. For researchers new to Hopf algebroids we include additional examples from ring theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to study the Auslander algebra of any representation-finite string algebra. More precisely, we introduce the notion of gluing algebras and show that the Auslander algebra of a representation-finite string algebra is a quotient of a \gluing algebra of $\vec{A}^e_n $. As applications, the Auslander algebras of two classes of string algebras whose quivers are Dynkin types $A$ and $D$ are described. Moreover, the representation types of the above Auslander algebras are also given exactly.</description>

      <title>On the unitary representation theory of locally compact contraction groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unitary representation theory of locally compact contraction groups and their semi-direct products with $\mathbb{Z}$ is studied. We put forward the problem of completely characterising such groups which are type I or CCR and this article provides a stepping stone towards a solution to this problem. In particular, we determine new examples of type I and non-type-I groups in this class, and we completely classify the irreducible unitary representations of the torsion-free groups, which are shown to be type I. When these groups are totally disconnected, they admit a faithful action by automorphisms on an infinite locally-finite regular tree; this work thus provides new examples of automorphism groups of regular trees with interesting representation theory, adding to recent work on this topic.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a precise conjecture relating integral form partially-symmetric Macdonald polynomials and the parabolic flag Hilbert schemes of Carlsson, Gorsky, and Mellit. This extends, in an explicit fashion, Haiman's realization of modified Macdonald symmetric functions via Hilbert schemes of points in the plane. As evidence for our conjecture we prove that it is compatible with the action of certain elements in Carlsson and Mellit's algebra $\mathbb{A}_{t,q}$, including degree $1$ Pieri formulas.</description>

Abstract: We give the definition of a dg-division algebra, that is a concept of a differential graded algebra which may serve as an analogue of a division algebra. We classify them completely, and show that they are either acyclic or have differential $0$. Further, we prove that the graded centre of dg-simple dg-algebras is a dg-division algebra, and also the dg-endomorphism ring of a dg-simple module is a dg-division algebra. We also shall give a Jacobson-Chevalley density theorem for acyclic dg-algebras.</description>

      <title>Formal extension of noncommutative tensor-triangular support varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a support variety theory defined on the compact part of a monoidal triangulated category, we define an extension to the non-compact part following the blueprint of Benson--Carlson--Rickard, Benson--Iyengar--Krause, Balmer--Favi, and Stevenson. We generalize important aspects of the theory of extended support varieties to the noncommutative case, and give characterizations of when an extended support theory detects the zero object, under certain assumptions. In particular, we show that when the original support variety theory is based on a Noetherian topological space, detects the zero object, satisfies a generalized tensor product property, and comes equipped with a comparison map, then the extended support variety also detects the zero object. In the case of stable categories of finite tensor categories, this gives conditions under which the central cohomological support admits an extension that detects the zero object, confirming part of a recent conjecture made by the second author together with Nakano and Yakimov.</description>
