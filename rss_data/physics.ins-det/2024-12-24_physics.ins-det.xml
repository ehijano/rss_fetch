      <title>Development of large Micromegas readout planes for experiments searching for rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) in particle physics experiments has been growing since their invention, reaching sizes equivalent to buildings (ALICE or ATLAS at CERN). However, their application in another class of experiments, commonly referred to as rare event experiments, has been more recent.
  This work focuses on two such experiments aimed at searching for rare events: the search for neutrinoless double beta decay (PandaX-III experiment) and the search for WIMPs (TREX-DM experiment). Both utilize a large-sized gaseous TPC, necessitating that the corresponding readout plane is also large.
  Both also employ microbulk Micromegas readout planes. This technology has become established in recent years and is continuously improving. Due to the size limitation during manufacturing and the concurrent increase in the size of double beta experiments, there arose a need to develop a tiled readout plane, using a mosaic of modules with microbulk Micromegas, conforming the first part of this thesis, in the context of the PandaX-III experiment. The second part, featuring a single readout plane of 25 x 25 cm2 installed in TREX-DM, focuses on the specifications that define a Micromegas and its response in a high-pressure gaseous detector.
  Additionally, during the work on TREX-DM, the need to reduce the energy threshold of the experiment emerged, leading to the development of another composite readout plane, the GEM-Micromegas system, in which a GEM specifically manufactured for this system was installed above the Micromegas. Finally, leveraging the development of the Micromegas for TREX-DM, a new gaseous detector for the detection of surface alpha particles, called AlphaCAMM, is planned, designed, and implemented, addressing all the requirements of a low-background detector with a projection beyond the TREX-DM experiment.</description>

      <title>Absorption and Dispersion: In Search of a Versatile Spectroscopic Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates three spectroscopic techniques - Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS), Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy (WMS), and Heterodyne Phase Sensitive Dispersion Spectroscopy (HPSDS) - to evaluate their performance in detecting carbon monoxide (CO) in nitrogen in a 31 m Herriot cell using an Interband Cascade Laser (ICL) emitting at 4559 nm. With the developed spectrometer, we can switch between the techniques with minimal hardware modifications. Calibration curves were established using simple peak-to-peak values from the recorded TDLAS, WMS, and HSPDS spectra, as well as after applying respective spectral models of the sensor responses followed by a least-squares fitting approach. We compare the results when using the different techniques with respect to obtained linearity, minimum detectable value (MDV), standard deviation of the method (sx0), coefficient of variation of the method (Vx0), limit of detection (LOD), and Allan-Werle deviation analysis. The results show significant differences in the performance of the three techniques when establishing calibration curves based on peak-to-peak evaluation of the recorded spectra. However, when establishing model-based calibration curves, a more uniform performance of the investigated techniques was found. The results demonstrate that TDLAS is a straightforward and robust technique but has a limited measurement range of up to 65 ppm. WMS offers a linear range of up to 100 ppm if an appropriate spectral model is applied and a baseline-free operation but requires careful calibration. HPSDS stands out for its wide linear range of up to 100 ppm and immunity to power fluctuations. However, its operation requires a complex mathematical model and radio frequency (RF) components.</description>

      <title>Towards MPGDs with embedded pixel ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining gaseous detectors with a high-granularity pixelated charge readout enables experimental applications which otherwise could not be achieved. This includes high-resolution tracking of low-energetic particles, requiring ultra-low material budget, X-ray polarimetry at low energies ($\lessapprox$ 2 keV) or rare-event searches which profit from event selection based on geometrical parameters. In this article, the idea of embedding a pixel ASIC - specifically the Timepix4 - into a micro-pattern gaseous amplification stage is illustrated. Furthermore, the first results of reading out a triple-GEM detector with the Timepix4 (GEMPix4) are shown, including the first X-ray images taken with a Timepix4 utilising Through Silicon Vias (TSVs). Lastly, a new readout concept is presented, called the 'Silicon Readout Board', extending the use of pixel ASICs to read out gaseous detectors to a wider range of HEP applications.</description>

      <title>Geant4-based technical simulation study of plastic scintillators for Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of detector setup configuration and scintillator material choice on spectrum quality in Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) is fundamentally acknowledged primarily by empirical observation. However, this study quantifies the effects of ultra-fast plastic scintillators (BC422Q) within a conventional collinear (180-degree) detector setup used in the laboratory using the Geant4 simulation toolkit. We examine the impact of the scintillator's dimension and geometry (truncated cone vs. cylinder) on the detection efficiency for specific gamma-ray energies (1274 keV and 511 keV) and their proportion of corrupt events such as backscattering or multiple detections. Results indicate that the selection of scintillator dimension and shape significantly enhances detection efficiency albeit with an increase in corrupt events. Furthermore, we investigate the influence on the instrument response function (IRF) of the scintillators, showing how truncated cones offer superior precision and, thus, a narrower IRF compared to cylindrical shapes.</description>

      <title>Non-Linearities In Atomic Quantum Receivers: Harmonic And Intermodulation Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg sensors offer a unique approach to radio frequency (RF) detection, leveraging the high sensitivity and quantum properties of highly-excited atomic states to achieve performance levels beyond classical technologies. Non-linear responses and distortion behavior in Rydberg atom receivers are critical to evaluating and establishing performance metrics and capabilities such as spur-free dynamic range and tolerance to unwanted interfering signals. We report here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and spurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver. Single-tone and two-tone testing procedures are developed and implemented for measurement of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion in Rydberg atomic receivers based on multi-photon Rydberg spectroscopy and radio-frequency heterodyne signal detection and demodulation in an atomic vapor. For a predetermined set of atomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to a cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver selectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2) and third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range. Receiver intermodulation distortion is characterized for the case of an interfering signal wave applied at two frequency offsets relative to the near-resonant reference local oscillator, $\Delta F/F= 10^{-4}$ at 6dB and $10^{-6}$ at 22dB single-tone bandwidths, respectively. We observe that under suitable operating conditions the atomic receiver can exhibit a suppression of harmonic and inter-modulation distortion relative to that of classical receiver mixer amplifiers. Finally, we describe how the non-linear behaviors of atomic receivers can provide unique, controllable RF signatures inaccessible by classical counterparts and propose their use to realize secure communication modalities and applications.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic field-cycling instrument for optical NMR hyperpolarization studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) offers an attractive approach to enhancing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Efficient, optically-generated electron polarization can be leveraged to operate across a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields, making it particularly appealing for applications requiring high DNP efficiency or spatial resolution. While a large class of systems hold promise for optical DNP, many candidates display both variable electron polarizability and electron and nuclear T1 relaxation times as functions of magnetic field and temperature. This necessitates tools capable of studying DNP under diverse experimental conditions. To address this, we introduce a cryogenic field cycling instrument that facilitates optical DNP studies across a wide range of magnetic fields (10mT to 9.4T) and temperatures (10K to 300K). Continuous cryogen replenishment enables sustained, long-term operation. Additionally, the system supports the ability to manipulate and probe hyperpolarized nuclear spins via pulse sequences involving millions of RF pulses. We describe innovations in the device design and demonstrate its operation on a model system of 13C nuclear spins in diamond polarized through optically pumped nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. We anticipate the use of the instrument for a broad range of optical DNP systems and studies.</description>

      <title>Highly coherent phase-lock of an 8.1 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser to a turn-key mid-IR frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous-wave Fabry-Perot quantum cascade laser (QCL) emitting at 8.1 $\mu$m operating in the single mode regime has been coherently phase locked to a turn-key low-noise commercial mid-Infrared (mid-IR) optical frequency comb. The stability of the comb used as a reference is transferred to the QCL resulting in an integrated residual phase error of 0.4 rad. The laser linewidth is narrowed by more than two orders of magnitude reaching sub-kHz level at 1 ms observation time, limited by the spectral purity of the mid-IR comb. Our experiment is an important step toward the development of both powerful and metrology-grade QCLs and fully stabilized QCL frequency comb and opens perspectives for precision measurements and frequency metrology in the mid-IR.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive heterodyne detection at room temperature in the atmospheric windows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report room temperature heterodyne detection of a quantum cascade laser beaten with a local oscillator on a unipolar quantum photodetector in two different atmospheric windows, at 4.8 $\mu$m and 9 $\mu$m. A noise equivalent power of few pW is measured by employing an active stabilization technique in which the local oscillator and the signal are locked in phase. The measured heterodyne noise equivalent power is six orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with direct detection.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Optimization of Interferometric Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (iDWS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that light speckle fluctuations provide a means for noninvasive measurements of cerebral blood flow index (CBFi). While conventional Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) provides marginal brain sensitivity for CBFi in adult humans, new techniques have recently emerged to improve diffuse light throughput and thus, brain sensitivity. Here we further optimize one such approach, interferometric diffusing wave spectroscopy (iDWS), with respect to number of independent channels, camera duty cycle and full well capacity, incident power, noise and artifact mitigation, and data processing. We build the system on a cart and define conditions for stable operation. We show pulsatile CBFi monitoring at 4-4.5 cm source-collector separation in adults with moderate pigmentation (Fitzpatrick 4). We also report preliminary clinical measurements in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit (Neuro ICU). These results push the boundaries of iDWS CBFi monitoring performance beyond previous reports.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate the possibility to protect, with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), a critical infrastructure as the fiber-based one used for time and frequency (TF) dissemination service. The proposed technique allows to disseminate secure and precise TF signals between two fiber-opticconnected locations, on a critical infrastructure, using both QKD and White Rabbit technique. This secure exchange allows the secret sharing of time information between two parties for the synchronization of distant clocks with the highest stability and traceable to the Italian time scale. When encrypted, time signals would reveal to a third party no useful information about the synchronization status, providing a time stability two orders of magnitude worsened.</description>

      <title>Lab and Beam Tests of a SiPM-readout ASIC with a Large Dynamic Range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A front-end readout system with a large dynamic range is required for the high-granularity crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) at future Higgs factories. A new commercially available ASIC, MPT2321-B, which offers a significantly large dynamic range for the readout of the silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), has been tested in the laboratory and at a test beam facility. The fundamental performance metrics have been characterised, including response linearity and single photon sensitivity. To quantitatively assess the dynamic range of the chip and evaluate its feasibility for SiPM readout in high-granularity crystal ECAL, a beamtest was conducted using scintillating crystals exposed to electron beams. Beamtest results showed that the chip exhibits a promising performance in terms of a good signal-to-noise ratio and a relatively large dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Lowering threshold of NaI(Tl) scintillator to 0.7 keV in the COSINE-100 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: COSINE-100 is a direct dark matter search experiment, with the primary goal of testing the annual modulation signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA, using the same target material, NaI(Tl). In previous analyses, we achieved the same 1 keV energy threshold used in the DAMA/LIBRA's analysis that reported an annual modulation signal with 11.6$\sigma$ significance. In this article, we report an improved analysis that lowered the threshold to 0.7 keV, thanks to the application of Multi-Layer Perception network and a new likelihood parameter with waveforms in the frequency domain. The lower threshold would enable a better comparison of COSINE-100 with new DAMA results with a 0.75 keV threshold and account for differences in quenching factors. Furthermore the lower threshold can enhance COSINE-100's sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter searches.</description>
