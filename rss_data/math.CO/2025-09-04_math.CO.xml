      <title>Regular Structures in Kronecker Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kronecker sequences $(k \alpha \mod 1)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ for some irrational $\alpha &gt; 0$ have played an important role in many areas of mathematics. It is possible to associate to each finite segment $(k \alpha \mod 1)_{k=1}^{n}$ a permutation $\pi \in S_n$ associated with the canonical lifting to two dimensions. We show that these permutations induced by Kronecker sequences based on irrational $\alpha$ are extremely regular for specific choices of $n$ and $\alpha$. In particular, all quadratic irrationals have an infinite number of choices of $n$ that lead to permutations where no cycle has length more than 4.</description>

      <title>New bounds for some small multicolor Ramsey numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(G_1,\dots,G_k)$ is the smallest $n$ such that every $k$-coloring of the edges of $K_n$ contains a monochromatic copy of $G_i$ in color $i$. Ramsey numbers are challenging to compute, and few are known exactly. We use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers to search for structured colorings that give lower bounds, and we show $R(K_4,K_4-e,K_4-e) \ge 35$ and $R(K_3,K_4,C_4,C_4) \ge 49$. Moreover, we tighten some recent upper bounds for multicolor Ramsey numbers for cycles and show $R(C_3,C_6,C_6) = R(C_5,C_6,C_6) = 15$. Finally, we enumerate critical graphs for the numbers $R(C_4,K_{1,s})$ and $R(C_6,K_{1,s})$.</description>

      <title>Nets of conics containing a double line in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, $q$ even</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of nets of conics containing at least one double line in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ for $q$ even. This classification is obtained by classifying the orbits of planes in $\mathrm{PG}(5,q)$ that intersect the nucleus plane in at least one point, under the action of the group that stabilizes the Veronese surface in $\mathrm{PG}(5,q)$ for $q\geq 4$ even. As a result, we show the existence of $18$ nets containing at least one double line, $9$ of which have an empty base.</description>

Abstract: We establish new characterizations of graphs belonging to the $\mathbf{W}_p$ class. In addition, we characterize locally triangle-free $\alpha$-critical graphs in this class. As a consequence, our results yield a partial answer to a question raised by Plummer \cite{Plum93} in the case $p=2$.</description>

      <title>The generalized Tur\'an number for K_3 in graphs without suspensions of a path on five vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number $\ex(n, H, F)$ is defined as
  the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex graph that contains no copy of $F$.
  The suspension $\widehat{F}$ of a graph $F$ is
  obtained by adding a new vertex that is adjacent to every vertex of $F$.
  Mubayi and Mukherjee (2023, DM) conjectured that $\ex(n, K_3, \widehat{P_k})=\left\lfloor \frac{k-2}{2}\right\rfloor \cdot \frac{n^2}{8}+o(n^2)$, where $P_k$ is a
  path on $k\ge 4$ vertices. Using the triangle removal
  lemma, they verified this conjecture for $k=4,5,6$.
  Later, Mukherjee (2024, DM) established the exact value $\ex(n, K_3, \widehat{P_4})=\left\lfloor n^2/8\right\rfloor$.
  In this paper, using the stability method, we determine the exact value of $\ex(n, K_3, \widehat{P_5})$ by showing that for sufficiently large $n$, $\ex(n,K_3, \widehat{P_5})=\left\lfloor n^2/8\right\rfloor.$</description>

      <title>Lee Distance of cyclic codes of length $2^\varsigma$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m} + u\mathbb{F}_{2^m} + u^2\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $\varsigma$ and $m$ be a positive integers. Let $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{F}_{2^m} + u\mathbb{F}_{2^m} + u^2\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ ($u^3 = 0$). Cyclic codes of length $2^\varsigma$ over $\mathcal{R}$ are precisely the ideals of the local ring $\frac{\mathcal{R}[x]}{\langle x^{2^\varsigma}-1 \rangle}$. The Gray map from a code of Lee weight over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ to a code with Hamming weight over $\mathbb{F}_2$ is known to preserve weight. In this paper, we determine the Lee distance of cyclic codes of length $2^\varsigma$ over $\mathcal{R}$.</description>

      <title>On the difference of the intersection power graph and the power graph of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two graphs of the title both have vertex set G. In the intersection power graph, x and y are joined if some non-identity element is a power of both; in the power graph, x and y joined if one is a power of the other. Thus the power graph is a spanning subgraph of the intersection power graph, and we define the edges of the difference graph to be the difference of these edge sets. In this paper, we give a number of results about the difference graph. We examine groups whose power graph and intersection power graph coincide. In addition, we make some observations on isolated vertices in difference graphs. We study the connectedness and perfectness of difference graph with respect to various properties of the underlying group G. Furthermore, we investigate the operation of twin reduction on graphs, a technique that yields smaller graphs which may be easier to analyze.</description>

      <title>On the $Z_q$-forcing number: computational approach and exact values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero forcing is a graph coloring process that is used to model spreading phenomena in real-world scenarios. It can also be viewed as a single-player combinatorial game on a graph, where the player's goal is to select a subset of vertices of minimum cardinality that eventually leads to all vertices of the graph being colored. A variant of this game, called the $q$-analogue of zero forcing, was later introduced. In this version, the player again seeks to choose the smallest number of vertices that will eventually color the entire graph, while an oracle attempts to force the player to select a larger subset. In this paper, we exploit the structural properties of several graph classes in order to both derive algorithms to compute the exact value of $Z_q$, and to establish bounds and exact values of the parameter for these graph classes. In particular, we present a SAT-based algorithm to compute the $q$-analogue zero forcing number, offering optimal strategies for both the player and the oracle. Additionally, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the $q$-analogue zero forcing number for $q=1$ of cactus graphs. Lastly, we prove the exact value of this parameter for several graph classes such as block graphs. Our work extends previous results about trees by Butler et al. (2020) and Blanco et al. (2024).</description>

      <title>Excluding a Ladder as an Induced Minor in Graphs Without Induced Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-ladder is the graph obtained from two disjoint paths, each with $k$ vertices, by joining the $i$th vertices of both paths with an edge for each $i\in\{ 1,\ldots,k\}$. In this paper, we show that for all positive integers $k$ and $d$, the class of all $K_{1,d}$-free graphs excluding the $k$-ladder as an induced minor has a bounded tree-independence number.
  We further show that our method implies a number of known results: We improve the bound on the tree-independence number for the class of $K_{1,d}$-free graphs not containing a wheel as an induced minor given by Choi, Hilaire, Milani\v{c}, and Wiederrecht. Furthermore, we show that the class of $K_{1,d}$-free graphs not containing a theta or a prism, whose paths have length at least $k$, as an induced subgraph has bounded tree-independence number. This improves a result by Chudnovsky, Hajebi, and Trotignon. Finally, we extend the induced Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa result of Ahn, Gollin, Huynh, and Kwon in $K_{1,d}$-free graphs from long induced cycles to any graph that is an induced minor of the $k$-ladder where every edge is subdivided exactly once.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for planar graphs with maximum degree eight to be totally 9-colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A total coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of the vertices and edges such that two adjacent or incident elements receive different colors. The minimum number of colors required for a total coloring of a graph $G$ is called the total chromatic number, denoted by $\chi''(G)$. Let $G$ be a planar graph of maximum degree eight. It is known that $9\leq \chi''(G) \leq 10$. We here prove that $\chi''(G)=9$ when the graph does not contain any subgraph isomorphic to a $4$-fan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jordan schemes generalize association schemes in a similar way as Jordan algebras generalize the associative ones. It is well-known that association schemes of maximal rank are in one-to-one correspondence with groups (so-called thin schemes). In this paper, we classify Jordan schemes of maximal rank-to-order ratio and show that regular Jordan schemes correspond to a special class of Moufang loops, known as Ring Alternative loops.</description>

      <title>Coalition graphs of connected domination partitions in subcubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is subcubic if it is connected and its maximum vertex degree does not exceed 3. Two disjoint vertex subsets of a graph $G$ form a connected coalition in $G$ if neither of them is a connected dominating set but their union is a connected dominating set. A connected coalition partition of $G$ is a partition of its vertices $\pi(G) = \{V_1, V_2,..., V_k \}$, such that each $V_i$ is either a connected dominating set consisting of a single vertex or forms a coalition with some set of $\pi(G)$. The formation of connected coalitions is described by a coalition graph whose vertices correspond to the sets of $\pi$, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding sets form a coalition in $G$. We characterize all coalition graphs of subcubic graphs.</description>

      <title>All Ordinals are Cop-Robber Ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of cops and robbers, played on a fixed graph $G$, is a two-player game, where the cop and the robber (the players) take turns in moving to adjacent vertices. The game finishes if the cop lands on the robber's vertex. In that case we say that the cop wins. If the cop can always win, regardless of the starting positions, we say that $G$ is a cop-win graph.
  For a finite cop-win graph $G$ we can ask for the minimum number $n$ such that, regardless of the starting positions, the game will end in at most $n$ steps. This number is called the maximum capture time of $G$. By looking at finite paths, we see that any non-negative integer is the maximum capture time for a cop-win graph.
  What about infinite cop-win graphs? In this case, the notion of capture time is nicely generalised if one works with ordinals, and so the question becomes which ordinals can be the the maximum capture time of a cop-win graph? These ordinals are called CR (Cop-Robber)-ordinals. In this paper we fully settle this by showing that all ordinals are CR-ordinals, answering a question of Bonato, Gordinowicz and Hahn.</description>

      <title>Stabilizers and NIP arithmetic regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the NIP arithmetic regularity lemma for finite groups (due to the authors and Pillay), which describes the approximate structure of "NIP sets" in finite groups, i.e., subsets whose collection of left translates has bounded VC-dimension. Our new proof avoids sophisticated ingredients from the model theory of NIP formulas (e.g., Borel definability and generic compact domination). The key tool is an elaboration on an elementary lemma due to Alon, Fox, and Zhao concerning the behavior of subgroups contained in stabilizers. We adapt this lemma to arbitrary subsets of stabilizers using technical (but elementary) maneuvers based on work of Sisask. Using another trick from Alon, Fox, and Zhao, we then give an effective proof of a related result of the first author and Pillay on finite NIP sets of bounded tripling in arbitrary groups. Along the way, we show that NIP sets satisfy a strong form of the Polynomial Bogolyubov-Ruzsa Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Tropical linear series and matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a notion of tropical linear series on metric graphs that combines two essential properties of tropicalizations of linear series on algebraic curves: the Baker-Norine rank and the independence rank. Our main results relate the local and global geometry of these tropical linear series to the combinatorial geometry of matroids and valuated matroids, respectively. As an application, we characterize exactly when the tropicalization of the canonical linear series on a single curve is equal to the locus of realizable tropical canonical divisors determined by M\"oller, Ulirsch, and Werner. We also illustrate our results with a wealth of examples; in particular, we show that the Bergman fan of every matroid appears as the local fan of a tropical linear series on a metric graph. The paper concludes with a list of ten open questions for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Explicit computation of the generic degree of the generalized Verschiebung in rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to apply previous work on dormant opers to the study of the moduli space of stable bundles in positive characteristic. We affirmatively resolve the rank $2$ case of a conjecture proposed by the second author, which predicts a direct relationship between the number of higher-level dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2$-opers and the generic degree of the generalized Verschiebung map for rank $2$ stable bundles induced by Frobenius pull-back. As a consequence, we obtain a procedure for explicitly determining these generic degrees in the previously unexplored range of genera by counting certain combinatorial objects.</description>

      <title>Submonoids of Infinite Symmetric Inverse Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis we study the subsemigroup structure of the symmetric inverse monoid $I_X$, the inverse semigroup of bijections between subsets of the set $X$, when $X$ is an infinite set. We explore three different approaches to this task. First, we classify the maximal subsemigroups of $I_X$ containing certain subgroups of the symmetric group on $X$. The subgroups in question are the symmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset of $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite partition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in semigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover that the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the idempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms and partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$. Furthermore, we show that if a relational structure $R$ on a countable set $X$ only contains a finite number of relations, then there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that the union of the partial automorphisms of $R$ together with $U$ generates all of $I_X$. Finally, we study the subsemigroup structure of $I_X$ under a preorder introduced by George Bergman and Saharon Shelah in 2006 for the symmetric group. Extending the preorder to $I_X$, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are subsemigroups of $I_X$, we say that $S_1 \preccurlyeq S_2$ if there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that $S_1$ is contained in the semigroup generated by the union of $S_2$ and $U$. We classify certain types of subsemigroups of $I_X$ according the Bergman-Shelah preorder, and we formulate a conjecture analogous to the main result by Bergman and Shelah.</description>

      <title>Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [CMS24] we defined a new class of enumerative invariants called $k$-leaky double Hurwitz descendants, generalizing both descendant integrals of double ramification cycles and $k$-leaky double Hurwitz numbers. Here, we focus on the one-part version of these numbers, i.e.\ when the positive ramification profile is $(d)$. We derive recursions and use them to produce explicit formulas and structure results for some infinite families of these numbers.</description>

Abstract: We find bivariate generating functions for the $k=1$ cases of recently conjectured colored partition identities of Capparelli, Meurman, A. Primc, and M. Primc that are slight variants of the generating functions for the sum sides of the Andrews-Gordon and Andrews-Bressoud identities, relating them to recent work of Warnaar. This $k=1$ cases turn out to be equivalent to identities of Jing, Misra, and Savage. Finally, we provide bijections for these identities involving two-line cylindric partitions, in the spirit of Corteel.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $\chi(G) \le \lceil (\Delta+1)/2\rceil+1$ for any triangle-free graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ provided $\Delta \ge 524$. This gives tangible progress towards an old problem of Vizing, in a form cast by Reed. We use a method of Hurley and Pirot, which in turn relies on a new counting argument of the second author.</description>

      <title>Macdonald polynomials at t = 0 through twisted multiline queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiline queues are versatile combinatorial objects that play a key role in understanding the remarkable connection between the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a circle and Macdonald polynomials. Specializing the results of Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2018) to the $t=0$ case yields a formula for the $q$-Whittaker polynomials through the Ferrari--Martin (2007) algorithm with a major index ($\texttt{maj}$) statistic. In this paper, we reinterpret the $\texttt{maj}$ statistic as a $\texttt{charge}$ statistic on reading words, thereby bypassing the Ferrari--Martin algorithm to obtain an elegant formula for the $q$-Whittaker polynomials. Our methods naturally extend to the case of bosonic multiline queues, with which we obtain analogous results for the modified Hall--Littlewood polynomials using a $\texttt{cocharge}$ statistic on reading words.
  Twisted multiline queues (GMLQs) are obtained from the action of the symmetric group on the rows of a multiline queue. The Ferrari--Martin algorithm was extended to GMLQs by Arita--Ayyer--Mallick--Prolhac (2011), and Aas--Grinberg--Scrimshaw (2020) showed it is preserved under this action. We extend these results by defining a $\texttt{maj}$ statistic on GMLQs that is also preserved under this action. This yields a novel family of formulas, indexed by compositions, for the $q$-Whittaker polynomials. Additionally, we define a procedure on both GMLQs and bosonic multiline queues that we call collapsing, which can can be realized via the Kashiwara (crystal) operators on type-A Kirillov--Reshetikhin crystals. As an application, we naturally recover the Lascoux--Sch\"utzenberger $\texttt{charge}$ formula for the $q$-Whittaker and modified Hall--Littlewood polynomials, and the classical and dual Cauchy identities for Schur functions.</description>

      <title>Spectral Tur\'an problems for nondegenerate hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keevash, Lenz and Mubayi developed a general criterion for hypergraph spectral extremal problems in their seminal work (SIAM J. Discrete Math., 2014). Their framework shows that extremal results on the $\alpha$-spectral radius (for $\alpha &gt; 1$) may be deduced from a corresponding hypergraph Tur\'an problem exhibiting stability properties, provided its extremal construction satisfies certain continuity assumptions. In this paper, we establish a spectral stability result for nondegenerate hypergraphs, extending the Keevash--Lenz--Mubayi criterion. Applying this result, we derive two general spectral Tur\'an theorems for hypergraphs with bipartite or multipartite pattern, thereby transforming spectral Tur\'an problems into the corresponding purely combinatorial problems related to degree-stability in nondegenerate $k$-graph families. As applications, we determine the maximum $\alpha$-spectral radius for several classes of hypergraph and characterize the corresponding extremal hypergraphs, such as the expansion of complete graphs, the generalized fans, the cancellative hypergraphs, the generalized triangles, and a special book hypergraph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A desarrangement is a permutation whose first ascent is even. Desarrangements were introduced in the 1980s by Jacques D\'{e}sarm\'{e}nien, who proved that they are in bijection with derangements. We revisit the study of desarrangements, focusing on two themes: the refined enumeration of desarrangements with respect to permutation statistics, and pattern avoidance in desarrangements. Our main results include generating function formulas for counting desarrangements by the number of descents, peaks, valleys, double ascents, and double descents, as well as a complete enumeration of desarrangements avoiding a prescribed set of length 3 patterns. We find new interpretations of the Catalan, Fine, Jacobsthal, and Fibonacci numbers in terms of pattern-avoiding desarrangements.</description>

Abstract: We prove new bounds for Ramsey numbers for book graphs $B_n$. In particular, we show that $R(B_{n-1},B_n) = 4n-1$ for an infinite family of $n$ using a block-circulant construction similar to Paley graphs. We obtain improved bounds for several other values of $R(B_r,B_s)$ using different block-circulant graphs from SAT and integer programming (IP) solvers. Finally, we enumerate the number of critical graphs for $R(B_r,B_s)$ for small $r$ and $s$ using SAT modulo symmetries (SMS).</description>

Abstract: For a poset $(P,\leqslant)$ we consider the first-order theory, that is defined by set $P$ and relation $\leqslant$. The problem of undecidability of combinatorial theories attracts significant attention. Recently A. Wires proved the undecidability of the elementary theory of Young lattice and also established the maximal definability property of this theory. The purpose of this article is to obtain the same results for another graded lattice, which has much in common with Young lattice: Young--Fibonacci lattice. As Wires does for Young lattice, for the proof of undecidability we define Arithmetic into this theory.</description>

      <title>Strong isometric path complexity of graphs: Asymptotic minors, restricted holes, and graph operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (strong) isometric path complexity is a recently introduced graph invariant that captures how arbitrary isometric paths (i.e., shortest paths) of a graph can be viewed as a union of a few ``rooted" isometric paths (i.e., isometric paths with a common end-vertex).
  We show that important graph classes studied in \emph{coarse graph theory} have bounded strong isometric path complexity. Let $U_t$ denote the graph obtained by adding a universal vertex to a path of $t-1$ edges. We show that the strong isometric path complexity of $U_t$-asymptotic minor-free graphs is bounded. This implies that $K_4^-$-asymptotic minor-free graphs, i.e., graphs that are quasi-isometric to a cactus [Fujiwara \&amp; Papasoglu '23], have bounded strong isometric path complexity. On the other hand, $K_4$-minor-free graphs have unbounded strong isometric path complexity. Hence, for a graph $H$ on at most four vertices, $H$-asymptotic minor-free graphs have bounded (strong) isometric path complexity if and only if $H\not=K_4$.
  We show that graphs whose all induced cycles of length at least 4 have the same length (also known as monoholed graphs as defined by [Cook et al., \textsc{JCTB '24}]) form a subclass of $U_4$-asymptotic minor-free graphs. Hence, the strong isometric path complexity of monoholed graphs is bounded. On the other hand, we show that even-hole free graphs have unbounded strong isometric path complexity.
  We investigate which graph operations preserve strong isometric path complexity. We show that the strong isometric path complexity is preserved under the \emph{fixed power} and \emph{line graph} operators, two important graph operations.
  We also show that the \emph{clique-sums} of finitely many graphs with strong isometric path complexity at most $k$, yield a graph with strong isometric path complexity at most $3k+18$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of modern Schubert calculus is centered on Schubert varieties in the complete flag variety and on their classes in its integral cohomology ring. Under the Borel isomorphism, these classes are represented by distinguished polynomials called Schubert polynomials, introduced by Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger.
  Knutson and Miller showed that Schubert polynomials are multidegrees of matrix Schubert varieties, affine varieties introduced by Fulton, which are closely related to Schubert varieties. Many roads to studying Schubert polynomials pass through unions and intersections of matrix Schubert varieties. The third author showed that the natural indexing objects of arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties are alternating sign matrices (ASMs). Every ASM variety is expressible as a union of matrix Schubert varieties.
  Many fundamental algebro-geometric invariants (e.g., codimension, degree, and Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity) are well understood combinatorially for matrix Schubert varieties, substantially via the combinatorics of strong Bruhat order on $S_n$. The extension of strong order to ASM(n), the set of $n \times n$ ASMs, has so far not borne as much algebro-geometric fruit for ASM varieties.
  Hamaker and Reiner proposed an extension of weak Bruhat order from $S_n$ to ASM(n), which they studied from a combinatorial perspective. In the present paper, we place this work on algebro-geometric footing. We use weak order on ASMs to give a characterization of codimension of ASM varieties. We also show that weak order operators commute with K-theoretic divided difference operators and that they satisfy the same derivative formula that facilitated the first general combinatorial computation of Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of matrix Schubert varieties. Finally, we build from these results to generalizations that apply to arbitrary unions of matrix Schubert varieties.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is cyclically $c$-edge-connected if there is no set of fewer than $c$ edges that disconnects $G$ into at least two cyclic components. We prove that if a $(k, g)$-cage $G$ has at most $2M(k, g) - g^2$ vertices, where $M(k, g)$ is the Moore bound, then $G$ is cyclically $(k - 2)g$-edge-connected, which equals the number of edges separating a $g$-cycle, and every cycle-separating $(k - 2)g$-edge-cut in $G$ separates a cycle of length $g$. In particular, this is true for unknown cages with $(k, g) \in \{(3, 13), (3, 14), (3, 15), (4, 9), (4, 10)$, $(4, 11),$ $(5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 10), (5, 11), (6, 7), (9, 7)\}$ and also the potential missing Moore graph with degree $57$ and diameter $2$.

      <title>On restricted sumsets with bounded degree relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two subsets $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ and a binary relation $\mathcal{R} \subseteq A \times B$, the restricted sumset of $A, B$ with respect to $\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $A +_{\mathcal{R}} B = \{ a+b \colon (a,b) \notin \mathcal{R} \}$. When $\mathcal{R}$ is taken as the equality relation, determining the minimum value of $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B|$ is the famous Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, which was solved separately by Dias da Silva, Hamidoune and Alon, Nathanson and Ruzsa. Lev later conjectured that if $A, B \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| + |B| \le p$ and $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching between subsets of $A$ and $B$, then $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} B| \ge |A| + |B| - 3$.
  We confirm this conjecture in the case where $|A| + |B| \le (1-\varepsilon)p$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, provided that $p &gt; p_0$ for some sufficiently large $p_0$ depending only on $\varepsilon$. Our proof builds on a recent work by Bollob\'as, Leader, and Tiba, and a rectifiability argument developed by Green and Ruzsa. Furthermore, our method extends to cases when $\mathcal{R}$ is a degree-bounded relation, either on both sides $A$ and $B$ or solely on the smaller set.
  In addition, we construct subsets $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| = \frac{6p}{11} - O(1)$ such that $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| = p-3$ for any prime number $p$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a matching on $A$. This extends an earlier construction by Lev and highlights a distinction between the combinatorial notion of the restricted sumset and the classcial Erd\H{o}s--Heilbronn problem, where $|A +_{\mathcal{R}} A| \ge p$ holds given $\mathcal{R} = \{(a,a) \colon a \in A\}$ is the equality relation on $A$ and $|A| \ge \frac{p+3}{2}$.</description>

      <title>On the size of the neighborhoods of a word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The d-neighborhood of a word W in the Levenshtein distance is the set of all words at distance at most d from W. Generating the neighborhood of a word W, or related sets of words such as the condensed neighborhood or the super-condensed neighborhood has applications in the design of approximate pattern matching algorithms. It follows that bounds on the maximum size of the neighborhood of words of a given length can be used in the complexity analysis of such approximate pattern matching algorithms. In this note, we present exact formulas for the size of the condensed and super condensed neighborhoods of a unary word, a novel upper bound for the maximum size of the condensed neighborhood of an arbitrary word of a given length, and we prove a conjectured upper bound again for the maximum size of the condensed neighborhood of an arbitrary word of a given length.</description>

      <title>Dihedral sign patterns in $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connected components of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}(\mathbb{R})$ are in bijection with the $(n-1)!/2$ dihedral orderings of $[n]$. They are all isomorphic. We construct monomial maps between them, and use these maps to prove a conjecture of Arkani-Hamed, He, and Lam in the case of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$. Namely, we provide a bijection between connected components and sign patterns that are consistent with the extended $u$-relations for the dihedral embedding.</description>

      <title>Results on proper conflict-free list coloring of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a mapping $f:V(G) \to \mathbb{N}$, an $f$-list assignment of $G$ is a function that maps each $v \in V(G)$ to a set of at least $f(v)$ colors. For an $f$-list assignment $L$ of a graph $G$, a proper conflict-free $L$-coloring of $G$ is a proper coloring $\phi$ of $G$ such that $\phi(v) \in L(v)$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$ and $v$ has a color that appears precisely once at its neighborhood for every non-isolated vertex $v\in V(G)$. We say that $G$ is proper conflict-free $f$-choosable if for any $f$-list assignment $L$ of $G$, there exists a proper conflict-free $L$-coloring of $G$. For a non-negative integer $k$, we say that $G$ is \emph{proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosable} if $G$ is proper conflict-free $f$-choosable where $f$ is a mapping with $f(v)= d_G(v)+k$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$.
  Motivated by degree-choosability of graphs, we investigate the proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosability of graphs, especially for cases $k=1,2,3$. As the 5-cycle is not proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+2)$-choosable and it is the only such graph we know, it is possible that every connected graph other than the 5-cycle is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+2)$-choosable and thus every graph is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+3)$-choosable. To support these, we show that every connected graph with maximum degree at most 3 distinct from the 5-cycle is proper conflict-free $(\text{degree}+2)$-choosable, and that $S(G)$ is proper conflict-free $(\text{degree}+2)$-choosable for every graph $G$, where $S(G)$ is a graph obtained from $G$ by subdividing each edge once. Furthermore, by adapting the technique of DP-colorings, we prove that every graph with maximum degree at most $4$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+3)$-choosable.</description>

      <title>The ratio monotonicity of Eulerian-type polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by determining the location of modes of some unimodal Eulerian-type polynomials. The notion of ratio monotonicity was introduced by Chen-Xia when they investigated the $q$-derangement numbers. Let $(f_n(x))_{n\geqslant 0}$ be a sequence of real polynomials satisfying the Eulerian-type recurrence relation $$f_{n+1}(x)=(anx+bx+c)f_n(x)+ax(1-x)\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f_n(x),~f_0(x)=1,$$ where $a,b$ and $c$ are nonnegative integers. Assume that $deg f_n(x)=n$. Setting $g_n(x)=x^nf_n\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, we have $$g_{n+1}(x)=(anx+b+cx)g_n(x)+ax(1-x)\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}g_n(x),$$ We find that if $a+c\geqslant b\geqslant c&gt;0$, then $f_n(x)$ is bi-gamma-positive and $g_n(x)$ is ratio monotone. As applications, we discover the ratio monotonicity of several Eulerian-type polynomials, including the $(exc,cyc)$ $q$-Eulerian polynomials, the $1/k$-Eulerian polynomials, a kind of generalized Eulerian polynomials studied by Carlitz-Scoville, the $(des_B,neg)$ $q$-Eulerian polynomials over the hyperoctahedral group and the $r$-colored Eulerian polynomials. In particular, let $A_n(x,q)$ be the $(exc,cyc)$ $q$-Eulerian polynomials, we find that the polynomials $x^{n-1}A_n(1/x,q)$ are ratio monotone when $0&lt;q\leqslant 1$, while $A_n(x,q)$ are ratio monotone when $1\leqslant q\leqslant 2$.</description>

      <title>Integer Sets of Large Harmonic Sum Which Avoid Long Arithmetic Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give conditions under which certain digit-restricted integer sets avoid $k$-term arithmetic progressions. These sets and their harmonic sums can be computed efficiently. Through large-scale search, we identify integer sets avoiding arithmetic progressions of length 4 and 10 whose harmonic sums exceed earlier "greedy" constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study Cynk-Szemberg octic hyperplane arrangements from the perspective of homological properties of their derivation modules. In particular, we define the notion of the type of hyperplane arrangements that will be used in our characterization of rigid Cynk-Szemberg octic hyperplane arrangements. Moreover, we deliver a combinatorial non-freeness criterion for essential hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$.</description>

      <title>The approach of cluster symmetry to Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to employ a cluster-theoretic approach to provide a class of Diophantine equations whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial solutions through mutations.
  We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a discriminant algorithm to determine whether a given Laurent polynomial has cluster symmetry and whether it can be realized in a generalized cluster algebra.
  As applications of this framework, we solve Markov-cluster equations, describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita, and lastly give two MATLAB programs about our main theorems.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs embedded in generic ways and realizing them as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with long-time interest of us, especially, the author, in realizing graphs as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions of certain nice classes.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the set consisting of all components of preimages of all single points and endowed with the quotient topology canonically. In tame cases, such objects are graphs. The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and homeomorphic to a closed interval. These graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry since theory of Morse functions has been established in the former half of the last century.
  We present a new answer to the problem, saying that generically embedded planar graphs are homeomorphic to the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions obtained by elementary polynomials and elementary procedures.</description>

      <title>The partition function and elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each $n\geq 1$, we express the partition function $p(n)$ as a CM trace on $X_0(6)$ of the discriminant $\Delta_n:=1-24n$ invariants of a weight 0 weak Maass function $P$ that records
  where CM elliptic curves sit on $X(1)$, together with their canonical first-order "CM tangent'', the diagonal local slope of the CM isogeny relation on $X(1)\times X(1)$. In this viewpoint, we obtain a formula for $p(n)\!\!\pmod{\ell},$ when $\ell$ is inert in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_n}),$ as a Brandt-module pairing $\langle u_{\Delta_n},v_P\rangle$ that is assembled from oriented optimal embeddings of Eichler orders. For $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}$ and $j\geq 1$, we obtain a new proof of the Ramanujan congruences $$
  p(5^j n +\beta_5(j))\equiv 0\pmod{5^j}, $$ $$
  p(7^j n +\beta_7(j))\equiv 0\pmod{7^{ [ j/2]+1}}, $$ $$ p(11^jn+\beta_{11}(j))\equiv 0\pmod{11^j}, $$
  where $\beta_m(j)$ is the unique residue $0\le \beta&lt;m^j$ with $24\,\beta_m(j)\equiv 1\pmod{m^j}$. The key point is a "bonus valuation" that stems from the fact that the supersingular locus of $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ lies over $\{0, 1728\}$ for $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}.$ This special property, combined with the uniform growth of the $\lambda$-adic valuations of the number of oriented optimal embeddings, explains these congruences. More generally, we give a portable genus 0 template showing that the Watson--Atkin $U_\ell$-contraction works uniformly for suitable traces of singular moduli for genus 0 modular curves with $\ell\nmid N.$</description>
