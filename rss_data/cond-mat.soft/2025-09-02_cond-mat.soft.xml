      <title>Photothermomechanicaly Efficient, Low-Cost, High-Cycle-Life, Hybrid MXene-Polymer Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photothermomechanical polymer film actuators stand out among the dynamic components available for soft robotics due to a combination of assets, such as capability for rapid energy transduction, wireless control, and ease of miniaturization. Despite their anticipated superior performance, several design challenges remain. These include high operational temperatures, inadequate mechanical output relative to the radiation energy provided, limited durability during repeated use, and high production costs; such factors hinder the scalability of these actuating materials in practical applications. Here, we report a viable solution by substituting performance-enhancing nanoparticles with MXenes--carbon-based, two-dimensional materials known for their theoretical photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 100%. This led to the development of MXene-dispersed polymer trilayer actuators (MPTAs). Extensive photothermal and thermomechanical characterization demonstrated superior performance compared to previously reported actuators, with a reduced shed power demand (0.1 mW cm$^{-2}$ $^\circ$C$^{-1}$), substantial bending capacity per irradiation power per time (0.1$^\circ$ mW$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$), and enhanced cyclic longevity, with fatigueless operation of at least 1,000 cycles. We demonstrate three applications: A kirigami-inspired flower, parallel manipulator, and soft gripper. Additionally, these materials are cost-effective; thus, they are the optimal choice for long-term, reversible operation with efficient heat-to-work transduction.</description>

      <title>Poroelasticity of bottlebrush and linear polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of solvent molecules through soft, swollen networks is critical in both natural and engineered systems. While this poroelastic flow has traditionally been explored in networks where the mesh size is comparable to the solvent molecule size, the effect of network architecture on permeability remains underexplored. Here we investigate solvent transport in linear polymer networks (LPN) and highly elastic bottlebrush elastomer networks (BBN), where the presence of densely grafted sidechains allows for control over swelling and mechanical properties. By synthesizing BBNs with systematically varied crosslinking density while maintaining constant sidechain length and grafting density, we probe the poroelastic response in the stretched backbone regime (SBB). Poroelastic relaxation indentation experiments, performed in toluene, reveal how permeability scales with crosslink density and polymer volume fraction. Compared to LPN with identical chemistry, the BBN exhibited a lower permeability scaling exponent with polymer volume fraction that closely matches the theoretical exponent. Despite architectural differences, permeability data for both networks collapse onto a single curve when plotted against dry shear modulus. Our findings demonstrate that molecular network architecture significantly influences permeability, offering new routes to tailor solvent transport in soft, swollen networks. These insights highlight BBNs as a promising platform for applications in permeable membranes, filtration, and microfluidic systems, and pave the way for further studies on how network parameters, such as sidechain length, impact permeability in these highly tunable materials.</description>

      <title>When wall slip wins over shear flow: A temperature-dependent Eyring slip law and a thermal multiscale model for diamond-like carbon lubricated by a polyalphaolefin oil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative description of lubricant flow in nanoscale channels is complicated by various finite-size effects that are not taken into account in conventional thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) models. One of these effects is wall slip, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. The relationship between wall slip and thermal effects is intricate, and some authors debate whether the friction reduction observed in their experiments in the TEHL regime can be explained by either slip or viscosity reduction in heated lubricants. To disentangle these mechanisms, a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of the relationship between temperature and slip in the shear flow of a 4 cSt polyalphaolefin (PAO4) base oil in a nanoscale diamond-like carbon (DLC) channel is performed here. An Eyring law describes the relationship between slip velocity and shear stress at the solid-liquid interface for a given temperature and pressure. The same simulation campaign provides a pressure-dependent law for the interface thermal resistance (ITR) between DLC and PAO4. These constitutive laws are employed in a continuum model for lubricated parallel channels. By taking heat conduction into account and combining the slip and ITR laws with a temperature- and pressure-dependent Eyring viscosity law, questions about the competition of slip and thermal thinning of the lubricant can be answered. For DLC film thicknesses compatible with tribological experiments and applications, this model shows that slip is only relevant for very thin lubricant films that are typical of boundary lubrication, suggesting the dominance of thermal thinning in the TEHL regime.</description>

      <title>Homogenization framework for rigid and non-rigid foldable origami metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities.</description>

      <title>Ostwald Ripening in Underground Gas Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground gas storage is central to both climate mitigation and energy transition strategies, supporting both long-term carbon sequestration and seasonal hydrogen storage. A key mechanism governing the fate of injected gases is Ostwald ripening, the curvature-driven mass transfer between trapped gas ganglia in porous media. While ripening is well understood in open systems, its behavior in geometrically confined porous structures remains poorly characterized, especially over long timescales relevant to subsurface operations. Here, we present ultra-high-resolution microfluidic experiments that capture the evolution of residually trapped hydrogen over weeks in realistic, heterogeneous pore geometries under well-defined boundary conditions. We observe a distinct two-stage dynamic: a rapid local equilibration among neighboring bubbles, followed by slow global depletion driven by long-range diffusion toward low-chemical potential boundaries. Building on these insights, we develop and validate a continuum model that couples microscale capillary pressure-saturation (Pc-s) relationships, extracted via the pore-morphology method, with macroscopic diffusive transport. The model accurately predicts gas saturation evolution without fitting parameters and collapses experimental results across a range of experimental conditions. Extending the model to reservoir scales, we estimate equilibration timescales for CO2 and H2 in homogeneous sandstone aquifers. We find that ripening occurs much faster than convective dissolution in CO2 sequestration, and on timescales comparable to seasonal H2 storage operations. These findings establish a quantitative framework linking pore-scale heterogeneity to field-scale gas redistribution, with implications for the design and longevity of subsurface storage strategies.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Modeling of Two-Phase Flows: A Projection-Based Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes (CH-NS) equations provide a powerful framework for modeling multiphase flows with diffuse interfaces, enabling simulations of droplet breakup, bubble dynamics, and hydrodynamic instabilities. These capabilities are vital in boiling heat transfer, microfluidics, coating, additive manufacturing, and oil-water separation, where resolving fluid-fluid interactions is essential. Numerically, the CH-NS system is challenging: the Cahn-Hilliard equation involves higher-order derivatives and nonlinearities, and coupling with Navier-Stokes introduces strong two-way interactions. The velocity field advects the phase field, while the evolving interface alters density and viscosity, feeding back into the flow. Variable-density and variable-viscosity systems further increase complexity, requiring accurate treatment of property contrasts without losing stability or mass conservation. To address this, we employ a decoupled pressure-projection method with finite differences on staggered grids and explicit Euler time stepping. Our formulation extends the CH-NS system to homogeneous and variable-property fluids with consistent hydrodynamic-phase-field coupling. Validation against canonical benchmarks-including bubble rise and Plateau-Taylor instability shows excellent agreement in rise velocity, interface shape, and instability wavelength. This framework establishes a reproducible foundation for multiphysics extensions such as heat transfer, phase change, and electrohydrodynamics in boiling, droplet manipulation, and electronics cooling</description>

      <title>A correction tensor for approximating drag on slow-moving particles of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new form of the Cunningham correction factor is presented that requires no experimental fitting. It is expanded to provide a predictive heuristic for non-spherical particles, via definition of a "correction tensor''. Its accuracy is tested against experiments and kinetic theory for the sphere, and stochastic solutions to the Boltzmann equation for a range of spheroids. It represents a simple, general tool for approximating transport properties of non-spherical micro/nano particles in a gas.</description>

      <title>Percolation transition in entangled granular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly nonconvex granular particles, such as staples and metal shavings, can form solid-like cohesive structures through geometric entanglement (interlocking). The network structure formed by this entanglement, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we utilize network science to investigate the entanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through experiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we demonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number of links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a giant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose a continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed transition. Additionally, we find that particle's opening angle significantly affects mechanical bonding and, consequently, the network structure. This work highlights the potential of network-based approaches to study entangled materials, paving the way for advancements in applications ranging from mechanical metamaterials to entangled robot swarms.</description>

      <title>Follow the curvature of viscoelastic stress: Insights into the steady arrowhead structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on simulated dilute polymer solutions, this letter investigates the interactions between flow structures and organized polymer stress sheets for the steady arrowhead coherent structure in a two-dimensional periodic channel flow. Formulating the problem in a frame of reference moving with the arrowhead velocity, streamlines, which are also pathlines in this frame, enables the identification of two distinct topological regions linked to two stagnation points. The streamlines help connecting the spatial distribution of polymer stress within the sheets and the dynamics of polymers transported by the flow. Using stresslines, lines parallel to the eigenvectors of polymer stress, a novel formulation of the viscoelastic stress term in the momentum transport equation proposes a more intuitive interpretation of the relation between the curvature of the stresslines, and the variation of stress along these lines, with the local flow topology. An approximation of this formulation is shown to explain the pressure jump observed in the arrowhead structure as a function of the local curvature of the polymer stress sheet.</description>

      <title>Capturing the fractocohesive length scale through a gradient-enhanced damage model for elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to unravel the micro-mechanical underpinnings of the emergence of the fractocohesive length scale as a central concept in modern fracture mechanics. A thermodynamically consistent damage and fracture model for elastomers is developed, incorporating elements of polymer chain statistical mechanics. This approach enables the direct incorporation of polymer chain response into a continuum gradient enhanced damage formulation, that in turn allows a physically meaningful description of diffuse chain damage and corresponding fracture events. Through a series of numerical experiments, we simulate crack propagation and extract the fracture energy as an output of the model, while keeping track of the micromechanical signatures of diffuse chain damage that accommodate fracture propagation. Furthermore, we investigate flaw sensitivity and demonstrate that when flaw sizes are smaller than a critical length scale, the material response becomes largely insensitive to notch size. Finally, by combining the fracture toughness and the work to rupture, we identify a fractocohesive length of the material, corresponding to the full width of the damage zone and representing the region where the irreversible dissipation process (i.e., bond scission) is happening. As this region is dictated in the proposed FED model through the introduction of a length scale associated with the non-local nature of the damage and fracture process, the emerging relationship of the two length scales is discussed, effectively connecting the microscopic characteristics of damage to the effective macroscopic response.</description>

      <title>Landau-de Gennes Modelling of Confinement Effects and Cybotactic Clusters in Bent-Core Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bent-core nematic (BCN) systems in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) settings, focusing on the role of cybotactic clusters, phase transitions, confinement effects and applied external fields. We propose a generalised version of Madhusudhana's two-state model for BCNs in [Madhusudana NV, Physical Review E, 96(2), 022710] with two order parameters: $\mathbf{Q}_g$ to describe the ambient ground-state (GS) molecules and $\mathbf{Q}_c$ to describe the ordering within the cybotactic clusters. The equilibria are modelled by minimisers of an appropriately defined free energy, with an empirical coupling term between $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$. We demonstrate two phase transitions in spatially homogeneous 3D BCN systems at fixed temperatures: a first-order nematic-paranematic transition followed by a paranematic-isotropic phase transition driven by the GS-cluster coupling. We also numerically compute and give heuristic insights into solution landscapes of confined BCN systems on 2D square domains, tailored by the GS-cluster coupling, temperature and external fields. This benchmark example illustrates the potential of this generalised model to capture tunable director profiles, cluster properties and macroscopic biaxiality.</description>

      <title>Activity-driven sorting, approach to criticality and turbulent flows in dense persistent active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that dense active fluids comprising interacting particles with persistent self-propulsion are driven to a non-equilibrium steady state consisting of co-moving particles with co-aligned active forces. This velocity and force sorting appears to be associated with a critical state where the length scales associated with spatial correlations of the velocity and the propulsive force grow with system size. At large system sizes, these growing velocity domains are accompanied by the appearance of dynamic macroscopic voids in the steady state, associated with large density fluctuations. The dynamics of the macroscopic voids drives a new kind of turbulent state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present work is to investigate the influence of the realistic model parameters on the equipartition of energy in a vibrofluidized system. To achieve this, a three-dimensional vertically vibrated granular system consisting of spherical particles is simulated using the discrete element method (DEM) using the open-source software LAMMPS. Interparticle and wall-particle interactions are determined using the linear-spring dashpot model. Simulations are performed for nearly perfectly smooth to nearly perfectly rough particles. Two different values for the ratio of the tangential to normal spring stiffness coefficient $\kappa$ ($2/7$ and $3/4$) are chosen. Non-equipartition of energy between the translational and rotational modes is observed for all realistic values in the parametric range.</description>

      <title>Fully-chromophoric ferroelectric nematics for electronic electro-optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic electro-optic (EEO) phase modulation is a key emerging technology for the chip-scale inter-conversion of signals between the electronic and photonic domains. The recent discovery of the ferroelectric nematic ($N_F$) liquid crystal phase, a three dimensional fluid of rod-shaped organic molecules having near-perfect equilibrium polar molecular orientational order, offers attractive opportunities for the creation of second-order nonlinear optical materials for EEO. Here we propose and realize a design motif for NF EEO molecules in which few-nanometer-long molecular rods are functionalized both for electro-static end-to-end association, facilitating NF phase formation, and for chromophoric optical nonlinearity, enabling high EEO efficiency, a combination enabling an active second-order nonlinear EEO medium that is 100% chromophoric.</description>

      <title>Edge states, pairing, and sorting of motile chiral particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experiments on chiral active polar particles, realized as vibrated granular rods, revealing the formation of robust ``skipping orbits'' at hard boundaries. These edge states exhibit a net circulation opposite to the particles' intrinsic rotation and lead to a pronounced accumulation at the boundary, stronger than for their achiral counterparts. The directed nature of these orbits provides a simple yet high-fidelity mechanism for chiral sorting -- even for solitary particles, unlike in T Barois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 , 238003 (2020). We propose a unified theoretical framework for boundary interactions of both chiral and achiral particles. In this model, an effective outward radial force, proportional to motility and chirality, explains the observed boundary-hugging. Our theory predicts, and our experiments confirm, a transition in the pairing of two particles of the same chirality, from apolar spinners to polar circle walkers, with increasing packing fraction of an ambient medium of beads.</description>

      <title>Emergent Rotational Order and Re-entrant Global Order of Vicsek Agents in a Complex Noise Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy pursuit in complex environments drives emergent collective behaviors in active matter systems. A compelling platform to study the impact of environment cues is provided by the standard Vicsek model for studying flocking and swarming phenomena. In this study, we explore the collective dynamics of Vicsek agents in a complex noise environment, featuring a noiseless circular region ($\eta_{\text{c}} = 0.0$) surrounded by a noisy outer region ($\eta_{\text{b}} = 1.0$, tunable), with a mutually repelling interactions. By varying the outer noise intensity, we observe an emergent rotational order ($\phi_r$) that peaks at higher noise levels ($\eta_{\text{b}}\sim 1$), as revealed by phase and susceptibility plots. Global order follows ($\phi$) follows a `U' shaped curve, $\phi \sim 0.965$ at $\eta_b=0$, dies down to $\phi \sim 0.57$ at $\eta_b=0.9$ and re-enters at $\eta_b &gt; 1$ and peaks $\phi \sim 0.960$ at $\eta_b=1.5$. The latter rise attributing to $\phi_r$ increase. Higher particle velocities enhance escape rates ($\kappa$) from the circular region, with slower-moving agents exhibiting greater virtual confinement. We quantify escape dynamics through time-averaged and first-passage escape rates, demonstrating velocity-dependent retention on the probability of finding the bi-motility agent flocks at a give time resulting in segregation and trapping. Introducing a gradual noise increase from the circle's center to the outer region reduces both global ($\phi$) and rotational ($\phi_r$) order, underscoring the impact of environmental heterogeneity and sudden annealing over gradual change. These findings offer insights into predicting and manipulating active agent dynamics in heterogeneous environments, with applications in biological and synthetic swarming systems.</description>

      <title>When Blood Parts Ways: Phase Separation in Microstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how red blood cell (RBC) suspensions navigate porous materials is critical for for both fundamental physiology, such as maternal-fetal exchange in the placenta, and transformative biomedical applications, including rapid, low-cost disease diagnostics from a single drop of blood in resource-constrained settings. Here we elucidate how RBC movement through fibrous microporous structures is influenced by cell aggregation agents, emphasizing the impact of their clustering, membrane flexibility, and confinement. By varying the volume fraction of the RBC (hematocrit) and aggregation strength, we reveal a surprising phase separation: a dense RBC core surrounded by a cell-free layer, an effect not previously reported in whole blood studies. This separation is shown to be more pronounced with rigidified cells and persists even at high hematocrit levels, unlike in healthy samples. By connecting RBC deformability and aggregability to pore-mediated phase dynamics, our study provides a foundation for new diagnostic tools capable of classifying blood disorders or evaluating blood quality using only a sheet of structured paper, seamlessly integrating fundamental fluid mechanics with translational biomedical innovation in a previously unexplored manner.</description>

      <title>Active sorting to boundaries in active nematic -- passive isotropic fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a two-fluid model to study a confined mixture of an active nematic fluid and a passive isotropic fluid. We find that an extensile active fluid preferentially accumulates at a boundary if the anchoring is planar, whereas its boundary concentration decreases for homeotropic anchoring. These tendencies are reversed if the active fluid is contractile. We argue that the sorting results from gradients in the nematic order, and show that the behaviour can be driven by either imposed boundary anchoring or spontaneous anchoring induced by active flows. Our results can be tested by experiments on microtubule-kinesin motor networks, and may be relevant to sorting to the boundary in cell colonies or cancer spheroids.</description>

      <title>Optical Voltammetry of redox processes inside a nanohole with Opto-iontronic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is the most commonly used method in electrochemistry to characterize electrochemical reactions, usually involving macroscopic electrodes. Here we demonstrate a novel optical CV technique called Opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter ($(100 \text{~nm})^{3}$). This technique uses total internal reflection (TIR) illumination, Electric-double-layer modulation, cyclic voltammetry, and lock-in detection, to probe ion dynamics inside nanoholes. We applied this method to study EDL (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol (Fc(MeOH)$_2$) redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Butler-Volmer (PNP-BV) model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast. This work opens up opportunities for high-sensitivity, label-free analysis of electrochemical reactions in nanoconfined environments, with potential applications in pure nanocrystal growth and monitoring, and potentially single-molecule electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Influence of Stretching Boundary Conditions on Fracture in Phantom Star Polymer Networks: From Volume to Cross-sectional Area Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the effect of stretching boundary conditions, ranging from conservation of cross-sectional area to conservation of volume, on the rupture behavior of phantom star polymer networks using energy-minimizing coarse-grained molecular simulations. By continuously varying the deformation parameter, the simulations reveal that true stress and rupture characteristics, such as strain and stress at break and work for rupture, systematically decrease as the boundary condition approaches cross-sectional area conservation. In contrast, nominal stress and the corresponding rupture characteristics exhibit near-independence from boundary conditions, indicating that bond tension remains largely unaffected for phantom networks under the examined conditions. These results clarify that volume expansion primarily drives deviations in true stress and highlight a critical distinction between true and nominal stress-strain definitions. The difference between true and nominal stress-strain relations also affected the scaling exponent for strand length dependence on stretch at break. The findings stress the importance of specifying both deformation boundary conditions and stress-strain definitions in polymer network simulations for accurate interpretation of mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Self-Interactions Drive Polymer Chain Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report that a dielectric polymer chain, constrained at both ends, sharply collapses when exposed to a high electric field. The chain collapse is driven by nonlocal dipolar interactions and anisotropic polarization of monomers, a characteristic of real polymers that prior theories were unable to incorporate. Once collapsed, a large number of chain monomers accumulate at the center location between the chain ends, locally increasing the electric field and polarization by orders of magnitude. The chain collapse is sensitive to the orientation of the applied electric field and chain stretch. Our findings not only offer new ways for rapid actuation and sensing but also provide a pathway to discover the critical physics behind instabilities and electrical breakdown in dielectric polymers.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretical Approach to Relaxation Time Distribution in Rheology: Log-Normal Relaxation Spectrum Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation modulus of a viscoelastic fluid can be decomposed into multiple Maxwell models and characterized by the relaxation spectrum for the relaxation time. It is empirically known that the logarithmic relaxation time is useful to express the relaxation spectrum. We use information geometry to analyze the relaxation modulus and shown that the logarithmic relaxation time is the most natural variable for the relaxation spectrum. Then we use information theory to estimate the most probable functional form for the relaxation spectrum. We show that the log-normal distribution is the information-theoretically most probable relaxation spectrum. We analyze the properties of the log-normal relaxation spectrum model and compare it with the fractional Maxwell model. The fractional Maxwell model with a small power-law exponent can be approximated as the log-normal relaxation spectrum model with a large standard deviation. We also compare the log-normal relaxation spectrum model with experimental linear viscoelasticity data for a high-density polyethylene, both at melt and solid states.</description>

      <title>Impact of early-age exposure to power ultrasound on the micromechanical properties of hardened cement paste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cement paste serves as the universal binder in concrete, formed by mixing water with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). In its fresh state, cement paste is a suspension in which the initial particle inventory continuously dissolves, while simultaneously, a growing population of colloidal calcium silica-hydrate (C-S-H) particles forms and progressively builds a percolated structure that densifies and hardens through hydration. Like most colloidal gels, cement paste is sensitive to external stimuli such as mechanical vibrations and temperature variations. Here, we show that power ultrasound (PUS) applied to OPC paste during the very early stages of hydration significantly alters the mechanical properties of the hardened material. Freshly prepared cement pastes are exposed to PUS at varying durations and intensities before curing for 28 days. Micro-indentation testing at the scale of tens of microns reveals that increasing PUS amplitude and prolonged PUS exposure degrade the micro-mechanical properties of hardened cement paste, making it more ductile. This softening behavior evolves continuously with exposure conditions and is consistent with an increase in porosity, likely caused by micro-cracks induced by PUS. This scenario is further supported by micro-scratch testing, which shows higher levels of acoustic emission in PUS-exposed samples. Finally, nano-indentation confirms that the properties of the individual phases composing the hardened paste -- low-density and high-density C-S-H -- remain largely unaffected. These findings offer valuable experimental insights into novel pathways for modifying the mechanical properties of reactive colloidal gels.</description>

      <title>Mechanical performance of hybrid polymer-lipid vesicles with leaflet asymmetry engineered using microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid vesicles consist of aqueous cores surrounded by a bilayer of phospholipids. Hybrid polymer-lipid vesicles incorporate both polymers and lipids, offering promising properties for developing pharmaceuticals, biosensors, and artificial cells. The hybrid vesicles can be symmetric, in which their two leaflets contain identical compositions, or asymmetric, in which the leaflets possess dissimilar compositions and can lead to dramatically modified properties. However, methods to produce both symmetric and asymmetric hybrid vesicles result in heterogenous compositions and sizes, making it challenging to quantify the effect of asymmetry and limiting applications. Here, we use a microfluidic approach to produce hybrid vesicles containing symmetric or asymmetric leaflets with precisely engineered compositions. We find the vesicles with asymmetric leaflets are significantly stiffer and tougher than those with symmetric leaflets; moreover, the lateral diffusivity of lipids is greatly decreased. The structure for improved toughness consists of an inner leaflet that is a stretchable lipid leaflet and an outer leaflet that is a fully continuous polymer leaflet. This technique of precisely engineering asymmetric structures may be applied to hybrid vesicles composed of block copolymers and phospholipids dissolvable in chloroform and hexane, further expanding their applications.</description>

      <title>Dual Cross-Linked Hydrogels: Linear Rheology and Fractional Calculus Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogels are increasingly recognized as a versatile platform for applications spanning from tissue engineering to soft robotics or flexible electronics. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing and tailoring their mechanical performance to meet application-specific demands. However, the intricate viscoelastic response of hydrogels remains challenging to capture using conventional phenomenological models. In this study, we prepared a series of tough dual crosslinked hydrogels -- poly(methacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)-Fe3+ and systematically tuned their mechanical properties by leveraging the salting-out effect. The viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels was characterized under shear deformations, and a four-parameter Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) was constructed to quantitatively describe oscillatory shear, creep, and stress relaxation responses. The influence of salt concentration on each FMM parameter was analyzed and correlated with bulk mechanical performance. This framework provides a first step toward capturing the complex viscoelastic nature of the advanced hydrogels and lays the foundation for developing more comprehensive nonlinear constitutive models.</description>

      <title>Transforming tubular packings to bicontinuous surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The link between bicontinuous architectures in biological membranes and triply-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) is a well established example of stunning geometric form in nature. The prolamellar body (PLB) in early plant plastid development is a classic example, forming the Diamond TPMS in a lipid-protein-pigment membrane. However, the early development of such spectacular geometric structures is poorly understood. Inspired by the presence of tubules in the micrographs of early plastid membrane formation, we explore here geometric modelling of transformations of packings of cylinders that coalesce together to form bicontinuous structures. Using computational modelling, we find that specific cylinder packings with cubic symmetry transform into highly symmetric TPMS, which now stand as a candidate set of surfaces for further investigation into the PLB, as well as other occurrences of bicontinuous membranes.</description>

      <title>Permeability heterogeneity and bulk linear elasticity determine interfacial pattern morphologies during confined, miscible displacements of clay suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a less viscous Newtonian fluid displaces an aging aqueous clay suspension in a confined space, a rich array of interfacial patterns emerges due to a predominantly viscous instability. In the present work, we controlled the mechanical properties of clay suspensions by incorporating additives and studied the interfacial instabilities that resulted when these suspensions were radially displaced by water in a Hele-Shaw cell. When the elasticity of clay was low, the interfacial dynamics exhibited features of nonlinear viscous fingering in heterogeneous media. By tuning the nature and content of additives that delay clay aging, we uncovered two novel propagation mechanisms: pattern growth via skewering and zig-zag finger propagation. These patterns have hitherto never been observed in experiments with colloidal systems. For moderate clay elasticities, we demonstrate here that shear-thinning-induced flow anisotropy leads to the formation of dendrites with dominant side branches. As clay elasticity increases due to the incorporation of salts, the energy required to create fractures becomes smaller than that for system-wide yielding. This scenario is characterized by the emergence of viscoelastic fractures. Our work demonstrates that incorporating additives is an effective strategy to manipulate the onset and growth of interfacial instabilities during the confined displacement of clay by miscible Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>Self-propulsive active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that active matter exhibits instances of mixed symmetry that cannot be fully described by either polar or nematic formalism. Here, we introduce a minimal model that integrates self-propulsion into the active nematic framework. Our linear stability analyses reveal how self-propulsion shifts the onset of instability, fundamentally altering the dynamical landscape. Numerical simulations confirm these predictions, showing that self-propulsion induces anti-hyperuniform fluctuations, anomalous long-range order in vorticity, and non-universal self-similar energy cascades. Notably, these long-range ordered states emerge within the active turbulence regime well before the transition to a flocking state. Additionally, our analyses highlight a non-monotonic dependence of self-organization on self-propulsion, with optimal states characterized by a peak in correlation length. These findings are relevant for understanding of active nematic systems that self-propel, such as migrating cell layers or swarming bacteria, and offer new avenues for designing synthetic systems with tailored collective behaviours, bridging the gap between active nematics and self-propulsive systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the diffusion equation derivation in Persson's theory of contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Persson's seminal work on tire-road interaction (Persson, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 115}(8), 2001), he ingeniously derived a diffusion equation in Appendix B to characterize the evolution of contact pressure between a rigid rough indenter and an elastic half-space with spatial magnification, which constitutes the foundation of Persson's theory of contact. Persson's theory has been extensively validated and applied to investigate nearly all critical aspects of tribological problems. In contrast to the well-known Greenwood-Williamson (GW) model, Persson's theory receives relatively less attention within the tribology community. One contributing factor to this discrepancy is that the original derivation of the diffusion equation in Appendix B is not easily understandable to non-physicists. In this technical note, the authors provide supplementary information for each step of the derivation, aiming to clarify the conceptual foundation for researchers who encounter difficulties in understanding Persson's theory, thereby encouraging its broader application within and beyond tribology.</description>

      <title>Stress Analysis of a Square Elastic Body Under Biaxial Loading Using Airy Stress Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an analytical investigation of stress distributions in square-shaped elastic bodies subjected to concentrated compressive loads under uniaxial and biaxial conditions. By employing the Airy stress function method, we derive closed-form solutions that satisfy the governing biharmonic equation and the prescribed boundary conditions along the edges of the square domain. The stress components are expressed as series expansions, with coefficients determined to enforce boundary constraints. In the uniaxial compression case, the resulting stress fields exhibit strong agreement with photoelastic fringe patterns previously observed in experimental studies. For biaxial loading, the solution represents a superposition of two orthogonal compression scenarios, producing spatial variations in the principal stress difference depending on the location within the domain.</description>

      <title>Self-Organising Memristive Networks as Physical Learning Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning with physical systems is an emerging paradigm that seeks to harness the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of physical substrates for learning. The impetus for a paradigm shift in how hardware is used for computational intelligence stems largely from the unsustainability of artificial neural network software implemented on conventional transistor-based hardware. This Perspective highlights one promising approach using physical networks comprised of resistive memory nanoscale components with dynamically reconfigurable, self-organising electrical circuitry. Experimental advances have revealed the non-trivial interactions within these Self-Organising Memristive Networks (SOMNs), offering insights into their collective nonlinear and adaptive dynamics, and how these properties can be harnessed for learning using different hardware implementations. Theoretical approaches, including mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems, reveal deeper insights into the dynamics of SOMNs, especially during transitions between different conductance states where criticality and other dynamical phase transitions emerge in both experiments and models. Furthermore, parallels between adaptive dynamics in SOMNs and plasticity in biological neuronal networks suggest the potential for realising energy-efficient, brain-like continual learning. SOMNs thus offer a promising route toward embedded edge intelligence, unlocking real-time decision-making for autonomous systems, dynamic sensing, and personalised healthcare, by enabling embedded learning in resource-constrained environments. The overarching aim of this Perspective is to show how the convergence of nanotechnology, statistical physics, complex systems, and self-organising principles offers a unique opportunity to advance a new generation of physical intelligence technologies.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency of Hydrocarbon Isomer Separation via Levi-Blow Mechanism: Benchmarking Against Conventional Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separation of hydrocarbon isomers with closely matched physicochemical properties remains an energetically demanding challenge in the petrochemical refineries. This study presents a comparative analysis of three methods: the fractional distillation, the Molex process, and the Levi-Blow (LB) technique. Using experimentally validated thermodynamic data and heat-transfer estimates, we quantify the energy expenditure and number of cycles required to achieve ultrahigh-purity separation. The LB method achieves eight-9s purity in a single cycle with just 39.4~kJ/mol, while fractional distillation and Molex require multiple iterations and up to five orders of magnitude more energy. Each method is also benchmarked against the thermodynamic minimum work of separation of the mixture of interest. It is found that the LB technique operates within a factor of 23 of this lower bound, compared to $\sim 10^2$ for Molex (Molex is a trademark and/or service mark of UOP Inc.) and $\sim 10^5$ for fractional distillation, demonstrating its thermodynamic and operational superiority.</description>

      <title>Learning by training: emergent return-point memory from cyclically tuning disordered sphere packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many living and artificial systems improve their fitness or performance by adapting to changing environments or diverse training data. However, it remains unclear how such environmental variation influences adaptation, what is learned in the process, and whether memory of past conditions is retained. In this work, we investigate these questions using athermal disordered systems that are subject to cyclic inverse design, enabling them to attain target elastic properties spanning a chosen range. We demonstrate that such systems evolve toward a marginally absorbing manifold (MAM), which encodes memory of the training range that closely resembles return-point memory observed in cyclically driven systems. We further propose a general mechanism for the formation of MAMs and the corresponding memory that is based on gradient discontinuities in the trained quantities. Our model provides a simple and broadly applicable physical framework for understanding how adaptive systems learn under environmental change and how they retain memory of past experiences.</description>

      <title>Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of Dataset Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self- supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray scattering at the carbon absorption edge is uniquely sensitive to local molecular bond identity and orientation in organic nanostructures, encoded as a function of photon energy and polarization. However, quantitative analysis is precluded due to the lack of accurate optical models with bond and orientation specificity. We generate such a model through an algorithm that parameterizes and refines density functional theory calculations with angle-resolved absorbance spectroscopy measurements. The resulting optical tensor is shown to reproduce data from samples with domains of different orientation and crystalline packing, enabling label-free orientation analyses of individual chemical moieties within molecular nanostructures using resonant X-rays.</description>

      <title>Optimal information injection and transfer mechanisms for active matter reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that makes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time inference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it serves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of how self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use a simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input signal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex systems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and independently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when switching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system completely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance landscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection force improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of the driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of smooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent gradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological systems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms, which manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably improving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We further perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases that arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer. Overall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are particularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the predictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological richness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.</description>

      <title>Wave-number lock-in in buckled elastic structures: an analogue to parametric instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric instabilities are a known feature of periodically driven dynamic systems; at particular frequencies and amplitudes of the driving modulation, the system's quasi-periodic response undergoes a frequency lock-in, leading to a periodically unstable response. Here, we demonstrate an analogous phenomenon in a purely static context. We show that the buckling patterns of an elastic beam resting on a modulated Winkler foundation display the same kind of frequency lock-in observed in dynamic systems. Through simulations and experiments, we reveal that compressed elastic strips with modulated height alternate between predictable quasi-periodic and periodic buckling modes. Our findings uncover previously unexplored analogies between structural and dynamic instabilities, highlighting how even simple elastic structures can give rise to rich and intriguing behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1707.04750v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article covers thermodynamic, dynamic, and kinetic models that are suitable for the analysis of wetting, adsorption, and related interfacial phenomena in colloidal and multiphase systems. Particular emphasis is made on describing crucial physical assumptions and the validity range of the described theoretical approaches and predictive models. The classical sharp interface treatment of thermodynamic systems where a perfectly smooth surface is assumed to separate homogeneous phases can present significant limitations when analyzing systems that are subject to thermal motion and present multiple metastable states caused by interfacial heterogeneities of nanoscale dimensions. Mesoscopic approaches such as stochastic Langevin dynamics can extend the application of sharp interface models to a wide variety of systems exhibiting metastability as they undergo thermal motion. For such metastable systems, dynamic and kinetic equations can describe the evolution of observable (macroscopic) variables as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. Sufficiently close to equilibrium, Kramers theory of thermally activated escape from metastable states can be effectively employed to describe diverse wetting and interfacial processes via kinetic equations. Future directions for further advancement and application of thermodynamic, dynamic, and kinetic models are briefly discussed in the context of current technological developments involving nanoparticles, nanofluidics, and nanostructured surfaces.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in a rough potential: Dual-scale structure and regime crossovers</title>

      <description>arXiv:1903.06294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion in a `rough' potential parameterized by a reaction coordinate $q$ is relevant to a wide spectrum of problems ranging from protein folding and charge transport in complex media to colloidal stabilization and self-assembly. This work studies the case of a potential having coarse-scale structure with characteristic energy barrier $\Delta U$ and period $\ell$, and fine-scale `roughness' of magnitude $\Delta U'\lesssim \Delta U$ and small period $\ell'\ll \ell$. Numerical solution of the Smoluchowski equation and analytical predictions from Kramers theory document distinct regimes at different distances $|\Delta q|=|q-q_E|$ from stable equilibrium at $q=q_E$. The physical diffusivity $D$ prescribed by dissipative effects can be observed farther than a distance $|\Delta q'| \propto (\Delta U'/\ell' + \Delta U/\ell)$. Rescaling the physical diffusivity to account for the fine-scale `roughness' is strictly valid when $|\Delta q| &lt; \Delta q_I \propto (\Delta U'/\ell' - \Delta U/\ell)$. Farther than a critical distance $\Delta q_{II}\propto \Delta U/\ell$ the diffusion process is free of coarse-scale metastable states, which facilitates determining the effective diffusivity $D'$ from the reaction coordinate trajectory. Closer to equilibrium the coarse-scale structure induces two diffusive regimes: nearly logarithmic evolution for $\Delta q_{II} &gt; |\Delta q| &gt; \Delta q_{III}$ and exponential decay over time for $|\Delta q| &lt; \Delta q_{III}\propto 1/\ell$. The effective diffusivity derived in this work is sensitive to the coarse- and fine-scale energy barriers and periods, and for $\ell'/\ell \to 0$ and $\Delta U'/k_B T \gg 1$ agrees closely with mean first-passage time estimates currently employed, which depend solely on the fine-scale energy barrier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many microswimmers are inherently chiral, and this chirality can introduce fascinating behaviors in a collection of microswimmers. The dynamics become even more intriguing when two types of microswimmers with distinct chirality are mixed. Our study examines a mixture of self-propelled particles with opposite chirality, investigating how the system's characteristics evolve as the magnitude of chirality is varied. In weakly chiral systems, the particles exhibit similar behavior, leading to a globally flocking phase where both types of particles are well-mixed. However, in an intermediate range of chirality, the condensates of different particles are formed as a result of a competition between chirality and self-propulsion. This competition results in interesting phases within the system. We explore the characteristics of these distinct phases in detail, focusing on the roles of self-propulsion speed and chirality.</description>

Abstract: We present an experimental study on the collective behavior of macroscopic self-propelled particles that are externally excited by light. This property allows testing the system response to the excitation intensity in a very versatile manner. We discover that for low excitation intensities, clustering at the boundaries is always present, even when this is prevented by implementing flower-shaped confining walls. For high excitation intensities, however, clusters are dissolved more or less easily depending on their size. Then, a thorough analysis of the cluster dynamics allows us to depict a phase diagram depending on the number of agents in the arena and the excitation intensity. To explain this, we introduce a simple kinetic model where cluster evolution is governed by a balance between adsorption and desorption processes. Interestingly, this simple model is able to reproduce the phase space observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic signaling gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we study under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always unstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to contract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now show that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active deformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable when the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We moreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability of the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of active tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional feedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken together, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust active tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.</description>

      <title>Variations of saturation vapor pressure and evaporation rate of liquids with their vaporization enthalpy</title>

Abstract: The phase transition enthalpy of condensed materials can be altered by factors such as electric fields, and such variations in turn affect physical and chemical behaviors including phase equilibrium. However, due to the neglect of non-expansion work, the Clapeyron equation does not account for the effect of changes in phase transition enthalpy on equilibrium. In this paper, by analyzing the electric-field-induced changes in phase transition enthalpy and incorporating the non-expansion work performed on the system, we extended both the Clapeyron and Clausius-Clapeyron equations to explicitly include variations in phase transition enthalpy. Building upon these extensions, analytical expressions for the vapor pressure of liquids and for the total evaporation rate of sessile liquid droplets as functions of the change in vaporization enthalpy have been derived, showing that an approximately 1% decrease in vaporization enthalpy of a liquid can cause an increase of about 20% in its vapor pressure and an almost twofold increase in its evaporation rate. The theoretical predictions by the present equations were compared and found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies</title>

Abstract: Tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs), model systems for motor-driven filaments, have been extensively studied in uniform activity fields. Here, we show that an activity gradient breaks fore-aft symmetry, generating net body forces that steer dimers, asters, and larger assemblies toward high-activity regions. Including temporal stochasticity softens the chains, allowing them to bend and wind around other filaments. Once several contacts are established, steric interlocking arrests relative motion and stabilizes the assembly into a hierarchically entangled cluster. These clusters persist for times far exceeding single-chain relaxation and do not appear under deterministic, temporally constant activity. Remarkably, such activity-induced gelation occurs even at polymer concentrations substantially lower than those typically required for passive chains. Our results reveal a new mechanism for activity-induced aggregation, providing new strategies for designing autonomous and reconfigurable microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Topological signatures of collective dynamics and turbulent-like energy cascades in apolar active granular</title>

Abstract: Active matter refers to a broad class of non-equilibrium systems where energy is continuously injected at the level of individual ``particles". These systems exhibit emergent collective behaviors that have no direct thermal-equilibrium counterpart. Their scale ranges from micrometer-sized swarms of bacteria to meter-scale human crowds. In recent years, the role of topology and self-propelled topological defects in active systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in polar and nematic active matter. Building on these ideas, we investigate emergent collective dynamics in apolar active granular fluids. Using isotropic granular vibrators as a model experimental system of apolar active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles in a dry environment, we uncover a distinctive three-stage time evolution arising from the intricate interplay between activity and inelastic interactions. By analyzing the statistics, spatial correlations, and dynamics of vortex-like topological defects in the displacement vector field, we demonstrate their ability to describe this intrinsic collective motion. Furthermore, associated to these topological defects, we reveal the onset of a turbulent-like inverse energy cascade, where kinetic energy transfers across different length scales over time. As the system evolves, the power scaling of the energy transfer increases with the duration of observation. Our findings show that topological concepts can be extended to the nonequilibrium dynamics of apolar active matter, revealing a direct link between microscopic topological processes and emergent large-scale behaviors in active granular fluids that lack both a well-defined direction of motion and an intrinsic axis of orientation at the particle scale.</description>

      <title>A mesoscopic model for the rheology of dilute and semidilute solutions of wormlike micelles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of a `persistent worm' is introduced, representing the smallest possible length of a wormlike micelle, and modelled by a bead-spring chain with sticky beads at the ends. Persistent worms are allowed to combine with each other at their sticky ends to form wormlike micelles with a distribution of lengths, and the semiflexibility of a wormlike micelle is captured with a bending potential between springs, both within and across persistent worms that stick to each other. Multi-particle Brownian dynamics simulations of such polydisperse and `polyflexible' wormlike micelles, with hydrodynamic interactions included and coupled with reversible scission/fusion of persistent worms, are used to investigate the static and dynamic properties of wormlike micellar solutions in the dilute and unentangled semidilute concentration regimes. The influence of the sticker energy and persistent worm concentration are examined and simulations are shown to validate theoretical mean-field predictions of the universal scaling with concentration of the chain length distribution of linear wormlike micelles, independent of the sticker energy. The presence of wormlike micelles that form rings is shown not to affect the static properties of linear wormlike micelles and mean-field predictions of ring length distributions are validated. Linear viscoelastic storage and loss moduli are computed and the unique features in the intermediate frequency regime compared to those of homopolymer solutions are highlighted. The inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) enables the distinction between Rouse and Zimm dynamics in wormlike micelle solutions to be elucidated. While the neglect of HI is justified in the case of entangled wormlike micelle solutions, here the concentration at which the onset of the screening of hydrodynamic interactions occurs is clearly identified.</description>

      <title>Role of Friction on the Formation of Confined Granular Structures</title>

Abstract: Unstable systems of fluidized grains in a very-narrow vertical tube can auto-defluidize after some time, the settling particles forming either a glass- or crystal-like structure. We carried out experiments using different polymer spheres, of known friction and roughness, fluidized in water. A diagram was obtained for the \RefereeA{shell-settled} particles when the coefficient of friction is of the order of 0.1, and their structure is characterized through an analysis of the nearest neighbors' angles. We show that the level of velocity fluctuations is higher for the high friction material, and that, once defluidized, the decrease in the coefficient of sliding friction leads to more organized (crystal-like) structures, while those with higher friction coefficients are amorphous (glass-like structures). Our results bring new insights for understanding the formation of glass- and crystal-like structures based on the material surface properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01910v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for 3He and 4He is considered on the basis of the Schr\"odinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.</description>

      <title>Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins using physically-motivated potentials for non-polar interactions, can identify the biologically correct assembly as the energy-minimizing state. Short-range potentials, however, produce rugged energy landscapes, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional local minimizers.
  Successful self-assembly simulations depend on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space.
  We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy.
  This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales.
  Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore, the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorem and optimal control of an active tracking particle with information processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling. We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived. Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system. Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.</description>

      <title>Exact Results in Stochastic Processes with Division, Death, and Diffusion: Spatial Correlations, Marginal Entropy Production, and Macroscopic Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</description>

      <title>An effective potential for generative modelling with active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. Time reversal is achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate, which can be readily implemented in simulations and experiments to generate new synthetic data samples driven by active fluctuations. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential, which opens up new avenues to exploit fluctuations in active and living systems for generative AI purposes.</description>
