      <title>Entropy as a Design Principle in the Photosystem II Supercomplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosystem II (PSII) can achieve near-unity quantum efficiency of light harvesting in ideal conditions and can dissipate excess light energy as heat to prevent formation of reactive oxygen species under light stress. Understanding how this pigment-protein complex accomplishes these opposing goals is a topic of great interest that has so far been explored primarily through the lens of the system energetics. Despite PSII's known flat energy landscape, a thorough consideration of the entropic effects on energy transfer in PSII is lacking. In this work, we aim to discern the free energetic design principles underlying the PSII energy transfer network. To accomplish this goal, we employ a structure-based rate matrix and compute the free energy terms in time following a specific initial excitation to discern how entropy and enthalpy drive ensemble system dynamics. We find that the interplay between the entropy and enthalpy components differs among each protein subunit, which allows each subunit to fulfill a unique role in the energy transfer network. This individuality ensures PSII can accomplish efficient energy trapping in the RC, effective NPQ in the periphery, and robust energy trapping in the other-monomer RC if the same-monomer RC is closed. We also show that entropy, in particular, is a dynamically tunable feature of the PSII free energy landscape accomplished through regulation of LHCII binding. These findings help rationalize natural photosynthesis and provide design principles for novel, more efficient solar energy harvesting technologies.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Conformational Analysis of $\alpha$/$\beta$-D-Xylopyranose at Pyrolysis Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Xylopyranose is the principal monosaccharide unit of hemicellulose, one of the three major biopolymers of lignocellulosic biomass. Understanding its decomposition mechanism is increasingly relevant for thermochemical biorefinery research such as pyrolysis. Significant efforts have been made to study its chemical and structural properties using both computational and experimental methods. However, due to its high structural flexibility and numerous hydroxyl groups, various metastable conformers arise. In this work, we performed a computational exploration of the conformational space of both anomeric forms, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , of D-xylopyranose using the semi-empirical GFN2-xTB method in conjunction with metadynamics and density functional theory simulations for structural optimization and vibrational analysis. Xylopyranose conformers free energy and enthalpy variations are analyzed across temperatures typical of fast biomass pyrolysis (298-1068 K), with the Boltzmann population distribution of the most populated conformers determined. This study provides a detailed computational analysis of the conformational space and thermochemistry of xylopyranose. Additionally, 44 and 59 conformers of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ anomers were found, for both of which a selection of 10 conformers based on Boltzmann population distribution analysis is performed to reduce the conformational space for ab initio studies of the pyrolysis reaction kinetics.</description>

      <title>Modified UNIFAC 2.0 -- A Group-Contribution Method Completed with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting thermodynamic properties of mixtures is a cornerstone of chemical engineering, yet conventional group-contribution (GC) methods like modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) remain limited by incomplete tables of pair-interaction parameters. To address this, we present modified UNIFAC 2.0, a hybrid model that integrates a matrix completion method from machine learning into the GC framework, allowing for the simultaneous training of all pair-interaction parameters, including the prediction of parameters that cannot be fitted due to missing data. Utilizing an extensive training set of more than 500,000 experimental data for activity coefficients and excess enthalpies from the Dortmund Data Bank, modified UNIFAC 2.0 achieves improved accuracy compared to the latest published version of modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) while significantly expanding the predictive scope. Its flexible design allows updates with new experimental data or customizations for specific applications. The new model can easily be implemented in established simulation software with complete parameter tables readily available.</description>

      <title>Taming Multi-Domain, -Fidelity Data: Towards Foundation Models for Atomistic Scale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are changing atomistic simulations in chemistry and materials science. Yet, building a single, universal MLIP -- capable of accurately modeling both molecular and crystalline systems -- remains challenging. A central obstacle lies in integrating the diverse datasets generated under different computational conditions. This difficulty creates an accessibility barrier, allowing only institutions with substantial computational resources -- those able to perform costly recalculations to standardize data -- to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of universal MLIPs. Here, we present Total Energy Alignment (TEA), an approach that enables the seamless integration of heterogeneous quantum chemical datasets almost without redundant calculations. Using TEA, we have trained MACE-Osaka24, the first open-source neural network potential model based on a unified dataset covering both molecular and crystalline systems, utilizing the MACE architecture developed by Batatia et al. This universal model shows strong performance across diverse chemical systems, exhibiting comparable or improved accuracy in predicting organic reaction barriers compared to specialized models, while effectively maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for inorganic systems. Our method democratizes the development of universal MLIPs, enabling researchers across academia and industry to contribute to and benefit from high-accuracy potential energy surface models, regardless of their computational resources. This advancement paves the way for accelerated discovery in chemistry and materials science through genuinely foundation models for chemistry.</description>

      <title>Atomistic catalyst polarization stemming hydrogen generation from CH4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the extremely-sized nanocrystals and nanopores, an adatom M and atomic vacancy V exhibit extraordinary capability of catalysis with however little knowledge about the catalyst-reactant interfacial bonding dynamics. With the aid of DFT calculations, we examined the dehydrogenization of a single CH4 molecule catalyzed using the Rh(111,100), W(110), Ru(0001) surfaces, and monolayer graphene, with and without M or V. It is uncovered in the following three components: (i) catalyst polarization due to atomic under- or hetero-coordination raises the valence band of the catalyst by bond contraction and atomistic dipolar MP and vacancy dipolar V formation; (ii) reactant bond elongation by the interplay of the MP-V = H attraction and MP-V = C repulsion with the = denoting the negative pole of the MP-V; and (iii) reactant conversion, i.e., the scale of H-C elongation, the catalyst valence-band shift, the adsorption energy, and the catalytic activity are proportional to the charge quantity of the MP-V whose local electric field matters.</description>

      <title>Polynomially efficient quantum enabled variational Monte Carlo for training neural-network quantum states for physico-chemical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a versatile and expressive alternative to traditional variational ans\"atze for simulating physical systems. Energy-based frameworks, like Hopfield networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, leverage statistical physics to map quantum states onto an energy landscape, functioning as memory descriptors. Here, we show that such models can be efficiently trained using Monte Carlo techniques enhanced by quantum devices. Our algorithm scales linearly with circuit width and depth, requires constant measurements, avoids mid-circuit measurements, and is polynomial in storage, ensuring optimal efficiency. It applies to both phase and amplitude fields, significantly expanding the trial space compared to prior methods. Quantum-assisted sampling accelerates Markov Chain convergence and improves sample fidelity, offering advantages over classical approaches. We validate our method by accurately learning ground states of local spin models and non-local electronic structure Hamiltonians, even in distorted molecular geometries with strong multi-reference correlations. Benchmark comparisons show robust agreement with traditional methods. This work highlights the potential of combining machine learning protocols with near-term quantum devices for quantum state learning, with promising applications in theoretical chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Stiefel Flow Matching for Moment-Constrained Structure Elucidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation is a fundamental step in understanding chemical phenomena, with applications in identifying molecules in natural products, lab syntheses, forensic samples, and the interstellar medium. We consider the task of predicting a molecule's all-atom 3D structure given only its molecular formula and moments of inertia, motivated by the ability of rotational spectroscopy to measure these moments. While existing generative models can conditionally sample 3D structures with approximately correct moments, this soft conditioning fails to leverage the many digits of precision afforded by experimental rotational spectroscopy. To address this, we first show that the space of $n$-atom point clouds with a fixed set of moments of inertia is embedded in the Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{St}(n, 4)$. We then propose Stiefel Flow Matching as a generative model for elucidating 3D structure under exact moment constraints. Additionally, we learn simpler and shorter flows by finding approximate solutions for equivariant optimal transport on the Stiefel manifold. Empirically, enforcing exact moment constraints allows Stiefel Flow Matching to achieve higher success rates and faster sampling than Euclidean diffusion models, even on high-dimensional manifolds corresponding to large molecules in the GEOM dataset.</description>

      <title>Control of open quantum systems: Manipulation of a qubit coupled to a thermal bath by an external driving field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and reliable manipulation with qubits is fundamental for any quantum technology. The implementation of these manipulations in physical systems is the focus of studies involving optimal control theory. Realistic physical devices are open quantum systems. So far, studies in optimal control theory have primarily utilized the Redfield/Lindblad quantum master equation to simulate the dynamics of such systems. However, this Markov description is not always sufficient. Here, we present a study of qubit control utilizing the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We compare the traditional master equation with more general Green's function results and demonstrate that even in the parameter regime suitable for the application of the Redfield/Lindblad approach, the two methods yield drastically different results when addressing evolution involving mixed states. In particular, we find that, in addition to predicting different optimal driving profiles, a more accurate description of system evolution enables the system to reach the desired final state much more quickly. We argue that the primary reason for this is the significance of the non-Markov description of driven system dynamics due to the effect of time-dependent driving on dissipation.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent dynamic nuclear polarization of diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can increase nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by orders of magnitude. DNP in diamond proceeds through different DNP mechanisms with a possible temperature-dependence. We report on 13C dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments in diamonds at 3.4 T and 7 T between 300 K and 1.7 K. Nuclear polarization enhancements between 100 and 600 were measured for all temperatures, corresponding to polarizations at 7 T between 0.1% (300 K) and 38% (1.7 K). A strong temperature dependence of the DNP profiles was observed. Longitudinal-detected (LOD) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments revealed an additional broad temperature-dependent electron line centered around the mI = 0 line of the P1 triplet transitions. Our results suggest that nuclei are preferentially polarized via a direct hyperfine mediated polarization transfer while spin diffusion in the sample plays a minor role.</description>

      <title>Flexible framework of computing binding free energy using the energy representation theory of solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Host-guest binding plays a crucial role in the functionality of various systems, and its efficiency is often quantified using the binding free energy, which represents the free-energy difference between the bound and dissociated states. Here, we propose a methodology to compute the binding free energy based on the energy representation (ER) theory of solution that enables us to evaluate the free-energy difference between the systems of interest with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike the other free-energy methods, such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), the ER theory does not require the MD simulations for hypothetical intermediate states connecting the systems of interest, leading to reduced computational costs. By constructing the thermodynamic cycle of the binding process that is suitable for the ER theory, a robust calculation of the binding free energy is realized. We apply the present method to the self-association of \textit{N}-methylacetamide (NMA) in different solvents and the binding of aspirin to $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) in water. In the former case, the present method estimates that the binding free energy decreases as the solvent polarity decreases. This trend is consistent with the experimental finding. For the latter system, the binding free energies for the two representative CD-aspirin bound complexes, primary (P) and secondary (S) complexes, are estimated to be $-5.2\pm 0.1$ and $-5.03\pm 0.09~\mathrm{kcalmol^{-1}}$, respectively. These values are satisfactorily close to those from the BAR method [$-4.2\pm 0.2$ and $-4.1\pm 0.2\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$ for P and S, respectively]. Furthermore, the interaction-energy component analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction between aspirin and CD dominantly contributes to the stabilization of the bound complexes, that is in harmony with the well-known binding mechanism in the CD systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of Frequency Fluctuation of Intramolecular Vibration in Solution Phase: Application to C--N Stretching Mode of Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate frequency fluctuations of intramolecular vibrations of a solute by exploring the fluctuation of the electrostatic potential by solvents. We present a numerical methodology for estimating the frequency fluctuations; the methodology is based on the reference interaction site model self-consistent field with constrained spatial electron density distribution, a the theoretical model of solvation fields based on classical statistic mechanics. By applying the present theory to the C--N stretching vibrations of several nitrile compounds, our estimated frequency fluctuation scale and bandwidth shift by changing solvent kinds reproduced the experimental data. Further, we regard the standard deviation of the electrostatic potential as the multiple random variables for analyzing the frequency fluctuations. Our results reveal that the dominant fluctuation of the electrostatic field is almost parallel to the vibrational axis. Additionally, the fluctuations of electrostatic potential become spatially nonuniform as the solvents form stronger hydrogen bonds with the solute. The development of the solvation field confirms that the nonuniformity of the electrostatic field is crucial to the frequency fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Capacitance in Surfactant Mediated Ion Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ion complexes hold the key for various energy transfer and communication systems in nature and industries. Achieving controllable mechanical and electrical properties in these complex systems is highly desirable but remains challenging. In this work, we propose the use of amphiphilic molecules to mediate salt crystallization. The resultant ionic interfaces can be tunable through reduced surface tensions of crystal facets, an additional intermolecular modifier, and the diffusion-limited crystallization during controlled solvent evaporation. Specifically, we utilized the ionic surfactant Sodium Lauryl sulfoacetate (SLSA) to mediate the crystallization of sodium chloride. Citric acid (CA) was adopted as a hydrogen-bond modifier. Systems mediated by SLSA exhibited the highest capacitance, and a significant enhancement of capacitance was also observed in systems with both SLSA and CA. The substantially increased capacitance of these ionic complexes can be attributed to changes in interfacial and crystalline grain structures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optical microscopy (OM), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) were used to study the effects of surfactant molecules in these ionic complexes. Understanding the role of ionic complexation in defining the thermodynamic and kinetic process of the crystallization process will contribute to better optimization in nucleation and scalability of organic and inorganic crystal production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time and length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

Abstract: Water at negative pressures can remain in a metastable state for a surprisingly long time before it reaches equilibrium by cavitation, i.e. by the formation of vapor bubbles. The wide spread of experimentally measured cavitation pressures depending on water purity, surface contact angle and surface quality implicates the relevance of water cavitation in bulk, at surfaces and at surface defects for different systems. We formulate a kinetic model that includes all three different cavitation pathways and determine the needed nucleation attempt frequencies in bulk, at surfaces and at defects from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.
  Our model reveals that cavitation occurs in pure bulk water only for defect-free hydrophilic surfaces with wetting contact angles below 50{\deg} to 60{\deg} and at pressures of the order of $-$100 MPa, depending only slightly on system size and observation time. Cavitation on defect-free surfaces occurs only for higher contact angles, with the typical cavitation pressure rising to about $-$30 MPa for very hydrophobic surfaces. Nanoscopic hydrophobic surface defects act as very efficient cavitation nuclei and can dominate the cavitation kinetics in a macroscopic system. In fact, a nanoscopic defect that hosts a pre-existing vapor bubble can raise the critical cavitation pressure much further. Our results explain the wide variation of experimentally observed cavitation pressures in synthetic and biological systems and highlight the importance of surface and defect mechanisms for the nucleation of metastable systems.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic self-assembly of neutral particles on a dielectric substrate: A theoretical study via a multiple-image method and an effective-dipole approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22608</link>

Abstract: A multiple-image method is developed to accurately calculate the electrostatic interaction between neutral dielectric particles and a uniformly charged dielectric substrate. The difference in dielectric constants between the particle and the solvent medium leads to a reversal of positive and negative polarizations in the particle. The variance in dielectric constants between the solvent medium and the substrate causes a transition from attractive to repulsive forces between the particle and the substrate. A nonuniform electrostatic field is generated by the polarized charges on the substrate due to mutual induction. These characteristics of electrostatic manipulation determine whether particles are adsorbed onto the substrate or pushed away from it. The self-assembled particles tend to aggregate in a stable hexagonal structure on the substrate. These findings provide new insights into self-assembly processes involving neutral particles on a dielectric substrate.</description>
