      <title>Toeplitz operators with symmetric, alternating and anti-symmetric separately radial symbols on the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider symmetric separately radial (with corresponding group $S_n\rtimes \mathbb{T}^n$) and alternating separately radial (with corresponding group $A_n\rtimes \mathbb{T}^n$) symbols, as well as the associated Toeplitz operators on the weighted Bergman spaces on the unit ball on $\mathbb{C}^n$. Using a purely representation theoretic approach we obtain that the $C^*$-algebras generated by each family of such Toeplitz operators is commutative. Furthermore, we show that the symmetric separately radial Toeplitz operators are more general than radial Toeplitz operators, i.e., every radial Toeplitz operator is a symmetric separately radial.</description>

      <title>Schatten--Lorentz characterization of Riesz transform commutator associated with Bessel operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Delta_\lambda$ be the Bessel operator on the upper half space $\mathbb{R}_+^{n+1}$ with $n\geq 0$ and $\lambda&gt;0$, and $R_{\lambda,j}$ be the $j-$th Bessel Riesz transform, $j=1,\ldots,n+1$. We demonstrate that the Schatten--Lorentz norm ($S^{p,q}$, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, $1\leq q\leq \infty$) of the commutator $[b,R_{\lambda,j}]$ can be characterized in terms of the oscillation space norm of the symbol $b$. In particular, for the case $p=q$, the Schatten norm of $[b,R_{\lambda,j}]$ can be further characterized in terms of the Besov norm of the symbol. Moreover, the critical index is also studied, which is $p=n+1$, the lower dimension of the Bessel measure (but not the upper dimension). Our approach relies on martingale and dyadic analysis, which enables us to bypass the use of Fourier analysis effectively.</description>

      <title>Quasinormability and property $(\Omega)$ for spaces of smooth and ultradifferentiable vectors associated to Lie group representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the spaces of smooth and ultradifferentiable vectors associated to a Lie group representation on a Fr\'echet space $E$ is quasinormable if $E$ is so. A similar result is shown for the linear topological invariant $(\Omega)$. In the ultradifferentiable case, our results particularly apply to spaces of Gevrey vectors of order $\lambda &gt;1$ of Beurling type. As an application, we study the quasinormability and the property $(\Omega)$ for a broad class of weighted spaces of smooth and ultradifferentiable functions on Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic polynomial approximation in the Bloch space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic polynomial approximation for a class of weighted Bloch functions in the unit disc. Our main result is a structural theorem on asymptotic polynomial approximation in the unit disc, in the flavor of the classical Plessner Theorem on asymptotic values of meromorphic functions. This provides the appropriate set up for studying metric and geometric properties of sets E on the unit circle for which the following simultaneous approximation phenomenon occurs: there exists analytic polynomials which converge uniformly to zero on E and to a non-zero function in the weighted Bloch norm. We offer a characterization completely within the realm of real-analysis, establish a connection to removable sets for analytic Sobolev functions in the complex plane, and provide several necessary conditions in terms of entropy, Hausdorff content and condenser capacity. Furthermore, we demonstrate two principal applications of our developments, which go in different directions. First, we shall deduce a rather subtle consequence in the theme of smooth approximation in de Branges-Rovnyak spaces. Secondly, we answer some questions that were raised almost a decade ago in the theory of Universal Taylor series.</description>

      <title>Neural reproducing kernel Banach spaces and representer theorems for deep networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the function spaces defined by neural networks helps to understand the corresponding learning models and their inductive bias. While in some limits neural networks correspond to function spaces that are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, these regimes do not capture the properties of the networks used in practice. In contrast, in this paper we show that deep neural networks define suitable reproducing kernel Banach spaces.
  These spaces are equipped with norms that enforce a form of sparsity, enabling them to adapt to potential latent structures within the input data and their representations. In particular, leveraging the theory of reproducing kernel Banach spaces, combined with variational results, we derive representer theorems that justify the finite architectures commonly employed in applications. Our study extends analogous results for shallow networks and can be seen as a step towards considering more practically plausible neural architectures.</description>

Abstract: In this article we prove that the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber (HCIZ) integral formula is equivalent to the unitarity of a canonical map between invariant subspaces of Segal-Bargmann spaces. As a consequence, we provide two new proofs of the HCIZ integral formula and alternative proofs of related results.</description>

      <title>Spectral deviation of concentration operators for the short-time Fourier transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.06150v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-frequency concentration operators restrict the integral analysis-synthesis formula for the short-time Fourier transform to a given compact domain. We estimate how much the corresponding eigenvalue counting function deviates from the Lebesgue measure of the time-frequency domain. For window functions in the Gelfand-Shilov class, the bounds almost match known asymptotics, with the advantage of being effective for concrete domains and spectral thresholds. As such our estimates allow for applications where the spectral threshold depends on the geometry of the time-frequency concentration domain. We also consider window functions that decay only polynomially in time and frequency.</description>

      <title>The product formula for regularized Fredholm determinants: two new proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.12923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an $m$-summable operator $A$ in a separable Hilbert space the higher regularized Fredholm determinant $\det\nolimits_m(I+A)$ generalizes the classical Fredholm determinant. Recently, Britz et al presented a proof of a product formula \[
  \det\nolimits_m\bigl( (I+A)\cdot(I+B) \bigr)
  = \det\nolimits_m (I+A) \cdot \det\nolimits_m (I+B) \cdot \exp\operatorname{Tr}\bigl({X_m(A,B)}\bigr), \] where $X_m(A,B)$ is an explicit polynomial in $A,B$ with values in the trace class operators. If $m=1$ then $X_1(A,B)=0$, hence the formula generalizes the classical determinant product formula.
  One of the purposes of this note is to present two very simple alternative proofs of the formula. The first proof is a priori analytic and makes use of the fact that $z\mapsto \det\nolimits_m(I+zA)$ is holomorphic, while the second proof is completely algebraic. The algebraic proof has, in our opinion, some interesting aspects in its own about the trace and commutators.
  Secondly, we extend the above mentioned formula to several factors \[
  \det\nolimits_m\Bigl( \prod_{l=1}^r (I+A_l) \Bigr)
  =\left( \prod_{l=1}^r \det\nolimits_m (I+A_l) \right)
  \cdot \exp\operatorname{Tr}\bigl({X_{m,r}(A_r,\ldots,A_r)}\bigr). \] The latter is more than just a straightforward generalization as we will gain more insights into the combinatorics behind it. Also we will present an algebraized version of the analytic proof in the language of formal power series. The upshot is that the two identities are just combinatorial in nature.</description>

      <title>Operator semigroups in the mixed topology and the infinitesimal description of Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a class of not necessarily linear $C_0$-semigroups $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ on $C_b(E)$ (more generally, on $C_\kappa(E):=\frac1\kappa C_b(E)$, for some bounded function $\kappa$, which is the pointwise limit of a decreasing sequence of continuous functions) equipped with the mixed topology $\tau_1^{\mathscr M}$ for a large class of topological state spaces $E$. If these semigroups are linear, classical theory of operator semigroups on locally convex spaces as well as the theory of bicontinuous semigroups apply to them. In particular, they are infinitesimally generated by their generator $(L,D(L))$ and thus reconstructable through an Euler formula from their strong derivative at zero in $(C_b(E),\tau_1^{\mathscr M})$. In the linear case, we characterize such $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ as integral operators given by measure kernels satisfying certain tightness properties. As a consequence, transition semigroups of Markov processes are $C_0$-semigroups on $(C_b(E),\tau_1^{\mathscr M})$, if they leave $C_b(E)$ invariant and they are jointly weakly continuous in space and time. Hence, they can be reconstructed from their strong derivative at zero and thus have a fully infinitesimal description. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a Markov core operator $(L_0,D(L_0))$ for the above generators $(L,D(L))$ and prove that uniqueness of the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations corresponding to $(L_0,D(L_0))$ for all Dirac initial conditions implies that $(L_0,D(L_0))$ is a Markov core operator for $(L,D(L))$. If each $P_t$ is merely convex, we prove that $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ gives rise to viscosity solutions to the Cauchy problem given by its associated (nonlinear) infinitesimal generator. We also show that value functions of optimal control problems, both, in finite and infinite dimensions are particular instances of convex $C_0$-semigroups on $(C_\kappa(E),\tau_\kappa^{\mathscr M})$.</description>

Abstract: We present developments in the theory of Korevaar-Schoen-Sobolev spaces on metric measure spaces. While this theory coincides with those of Cheeger and Shanmugalingam if the space is doubling and satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality, it offers new perspectives in the context of fractals for which the approach by weak upper gradients is inadequate.</description>

      <title>The Liouville theorem for a class of Fourier multipliers and its connection to coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Liouville property says that all bounded harmonic functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e.\ all bounded functions satisfying $\Delta f = 0$, are constant. In this paper we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on the symbol of a Fourier multiplier operator $m(D)$, such that the solutions $f$ to $m(D)f=0$ are Lebesgue a.e.\ constant (if $f$ is bounded) or coincide Lebesgue a.e.\ with a polynomial (if $f$ grows like a polynomial). The class of Fourier multipliers includes the (in general non-local) generators of L\'evy processes. For generators of L\'evy processes we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a strong Liouville theorem where $f$ is positive and grows at most exponentially fast. As an application of our results above we prove a coupling result for space-time L\'evy processes.</description>

      <title>Spectral reconstruction and representations of finitely generated groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that characters classify linear representations of finite groups, that is if characters of two representations of a finite group are the same, these representations are equivalent. It is also well-known that, in general, this is not true for representations of infinite groups, even if they are finitely generated. The goal of this paper is to establish a characterization of representations of finitely generated groups in terms of projective joint spectra. This approach has a clear advantage compared to character classification as it is valid for a much wider family of groups and for both finite and infinite dimensional representations. The main tool in establishing our spectral characterization is a reconstruction of an operator acting on a separable Hilbert space from the proper projective joint spectrum of the quadruple containing this operator along with a certain triple of bounded operators acting on the same space.</description>

      <title>Operation with Concentration Inequalities and Conjugate of Parallel Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the concentration of the measure approach, we consider the transformation $\Phi(Z)$ of a random variable $Z$ having a general concentration function $\alpha$. If the transformation $\Phi$ is $\lambda$-Lipschitz with $\lambda$ deterministic, the concentration function of $\Phi$ is immediately deduced to be equal to $\alpha(\cdot/\lambda)$. If the variations of $\Phi$ are bounded by a random variable $\Lambda$ having a concentration function (around $0$) $\beta: \mathbb R_+\to \mathbb R$, this paper sets that $\Phi(Z)$ has a concentration function analogous to $\gamma = (\alpha^{-1} \cdot \beta^{-1})^{-1}$. We apply this result to generalize Hanson Wright inequality, we express $\gamma$ with the conjugate functions of the parallel sum of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and further consider the case where $\Lambda$ is the product of $n$ random variables to provide useful insights to the so-called "multilevel concentration".</description>
