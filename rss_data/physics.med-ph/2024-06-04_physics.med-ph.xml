      <title>Intensity Normalization Techniques and Their Effect on the Robustness and Predictive Power of Breast MRI Radiomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiomics analysis has emerged as a promising approach for extracting quantitative features from medical images to aid in cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, radiomics research currently lacks standardization, and radiomics features can be highly dependent on the acquisition and pre-processing techniques used. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of various intensity normalization techniques on the robustness of radiomics features extracted from MRI scans of breast cancer patients. The images used are from the publicly available I-SPY TRIAL dataset, which contains MRI scans of stage 2 or 3 breast cancer patients and from the Platinum and PARP inhibitor for Neoadjuvant treatment of Triple Negative and / or BRCA positive breast cancer (PARTNER) trial. We compared the effect of commonly used intensity normalization techniques on the robustness of radiomics features using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between multiple combinations of normalization approaches, identified categories that are robust and therefore could be compared between studies regardless of the pre-processing used. We were able to show that while systematic differences between MRI scanners can significantly affect many radiomics features, a combination of Bias Field correction with piecewise linear histogram normalization can mitigate some of the effects compared to other normalization methods investigated in this paper. We were able to demonstrate the importance of carefully selecting and standardizing normalization methods for accurate and reliable radiomics analysis in breast MRI scans.</description>

      <title>3D transcranial Dynamic Ultrasound Localization Microscopy in the mouse brain using a Row-Column Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of brain hemodynamics in neurodegenerative diseases cannot be fully assessed using existing imaging technologies. Recently, 2D Dynamic Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (DULM) has allowed for the quantitative mapping of the pulsatile flow at sub-wavelength resolution. However, to obtain accurate velocity estimates, 3D imaging is more adapted, especially for complex vascularized organs like the brain. 3D+t DULM is achievable using matrix array probes, but suffers from limitations in terms of cost, device complexity associated with the high channel count, and operating frequencies. Alternatively, Row Column Arrays (RCA) can reduce the number of elements while maintaining a large field of view and high frame rate. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of performing 3D+t blood flow measurements in the mouse brain using an RCA and a DULM sequence with a high spatiotemporal resolution. Transcranial images of anesthetized mice (n=7) were acquired at a volume rate of 750 Hz using 42 tilted plane waves. After microbubbles localization and tracking, super-resolved dynamic density and velocity maps of the 3D brain vascular network were obtained. Cortical vessels were segmented and pulsatility in the arteries was significantly higher than in veins for all mice, in accordance with the literature. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and reproducibility of achieving high spatiotemporal resolution volumes of the mouse brain vasculature with DULM using a RCA.</description>

      <title>Depolarization diagrams for circularly polarized light scattering for biological particle monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: The depolarization of circularly polarized light caused by scattering in turbid media reveals structural information about the dispersed particles, such as their size, density, and distribution, which is useful for investigating the state of biological tissue. However, the correlation between depolarization strength and tissue parameters is unclear. Aim: We aimed to examine the generalized correlations of depolarization strength with the particle size and wavelength, yielding depolarization diagrams. Approach: The correlation between depolarization intensity and size parameter were examined for single and multiple scattering using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Expanding the wavelength width allows us to obtain depolarization distribution diagrams as functions of wavelength and particle diameter for reflection and transparent geometries. Results: Circularly polarized light suffers intensive depolarization in a single scattering against particles of various specific sizes for its wavelength, which becomes more noticeable in the multiple scattering regime. Conclusions: The depolarization diagrams with particle size and wavelength as independent variables were obtained, which are particularly helpful for investigating the feasibility of various particle-monitoring methods. Based on the obtained diagrams, several applications have been proposed, including blood cell monitoring, early embryogenesis, and antigen-antibody interactions.</description>

      <title>Validating Automated Resonance Evaluation with Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: The integrity and precision of nuclear data are crucial for a broad spectrum of applications, from national security and nuclear reactor design to medical diagnostics, where the associated uncertainties can significantly impact outcomes. A substantial portion of uncertainty in nuclear data originates from the subjective biases in the evaluation process, a crucial phase in the nuclear data production pipeline. Recent advancements indicate that automation of certain routines can mitigate these biases, thereby standardizing the evaluation process, reducing uncertainty and enhancing reproducibility. This article contributes to developing a framework for automated evaluation techniques testing, emphasizing automated fitting methods that do not require the user to provide any prior information. This approach simplifies the process and reduces the manual effort needed in the initial evaluation stage. It highlights the capability of the framework to validate and optimize subroutines, targeting the performance analysis and optimization of the fitting procedure using high-fidelity synthetic data (labeled experimental data) and the concept of a fully controlled computational experiment. An error metric is introduced to provide a clear and intuitive measure of the fitting quality by quantifying the accuracy and performance across the specified energy. This metric sets a scale for comparison and optimization of routines or hyperparameter selection, improving the entire evaluation process methodology and increasing reproducibility and objectivity.</description>

      <title>Can Entanglement-enhanced Quantum Kernels Improve Data Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical machine learning, extensively utilized across diverse domains, faces limitations in speed, efficiency, parallelism, and processing of complex datasets. In contrast, quantum machine learning algorithms offer significant advantages, including exponentially faster computations, enhanced data handling capabilities, inherent parallelism, and improved optimization for complex problems. In this study, we used the entanglement-enhanced quantum kernel in quantum support vector machine to train complex respiratory data sets. Compared to classical algorithms, our findings reveal that QSVM performs better with 45% higher accuracy for complex respiratory data sets while maintaining comparable performance with linear datasets in contrast to their classical counterparts executed on a 2-qubit system. Through our study, we investigate the efficacy of the QSVM-Kernel algorithm in harnessing the enhanced dimensionality of the quantum Hilbert space for effectively training complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Dreaming of Electrical Waves: Generative Modeling of Cardiac Excitation Waves using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical waves in the heart form rotating spiral or scroll waves during life-threatening arrhythmias such as atrial or ventricular fibrillation. The wave dynamics are typically modeled using coupled partial differential equations, which describe reaction-diffusion dynamics in excitable media. More recently, data-driven generative modeling has emerged as an alternative to generate spatio-temporal patterns in physical and biological systems. Here, we explore denoising diffusion probabilistic models for the generative modeling of electrical wave patterns in cardiac tissue. We trained diffusion models with simulated electrical wave patterns to be able to generate such wave patterns in unconditional and conditional generation tasks. For instance, we explored the diffusion-based i) parameter-specific generation, ii) evolution and iii) inpainting of spiral wave dynamics, including reconstructing three-dimensional scroll wave dynamics from superficial two-dimensional measurements. Further, we generated arbitrarily shaped bi-ventricular geometries and simultaneously initiated scroll wave patterns inside these geometries using diffusion. We characterized and compared the diffusion-generated solutions to solutions obtained with corresponding biophysical models and found that diffusion models learn to replicate spiral and scroll waves dynamics so well that they could be used for data-driven modeling of excitation waves in cardiac tissue. For instance, an ensemble of diffusion-generated spiral wave dynamics exhibits similar self-termination statistics as the corresponding ensemble simulated with a biophysical model. However, we also found that diffusion models {produce artifacts if training data is lacking, e.g. during self-termination,} and `hallucinate' wave patterns when insufficiently constrained.</description>

      <title>Generating Synthetic Computed Tomography for Radiotherapy: SynthRAD2023 Challenge Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation therapy plays a crucial role in cancer treatment, necessitating precise delivery of radiation to tumors while sparing healthy tissues over multiple days. Computed tomography (CT) is integral for treatment planning, offering electron density data crucial for accurate dose calculations. However, accurately representing patient anatomy is challenging, especially in adaptive radiotherapy, where CT is not acquired daily. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior soft-tissue contrast. Still, it lacks electron density information while cone beam CT (CBCT) lacks direct electron density calibration and is mainly used for patient positioning. Adopting MRI-only or CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy eliminates the need for CT planning but presents challenges. Synthetic CT (sCT) generation techniques aim to address these challenges by using image synthesis to bridge the gap between MRI, CBCT, and CT. The SynthRAD2023 challenge was organized to compare synthetic CT generation methods using multi-center ground truth data from 1080 patients, divided into two tasks: 1) MRI-to-CT and 2) CBCT-to-CT. The evaluation included image similarity and dose-based metrics from proton and photon plans. The challenge attracted significant participation, with 617 registrations and 22/17 valid submissions for tasks 1/2. Top-performing teams achieved high structural similarity indices (&gt;0.87/0.90) and gamma pass rates for photon (&gt;98.1%/99.0%) and proton (&gt;99.0%/97.3%) plans. However, no significant correlation was found between image similarity metrics and dose accuracy, emphasizing the need for dose evaluation when assessing the clinical applicability of sCT. SynthRAD2023 facilitated the investigation and benchmarking of sCT generation techniques, providing insights for developing MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend evaluating the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>
