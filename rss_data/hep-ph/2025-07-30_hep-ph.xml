      <title>Hadron Production Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental search for the pion -- proposed in 1935 by Hideki Yukawa as the force carrier of the strong nucleon-nucleon interaction -- was rewarded in 1947 when in cosmic ray photographic emulsion data a charged particle was identified with the proper mass of about 300 times the electron mass, completed three years later by the discovery of the neutral pion. Since then, accelerator-driven pion and meson (photo-)production on the nucleon and the associated production of new baryons have become the key elements for ground-breaking discoveries in numerous areas of particle and nuclear physics, from fundamental symmetries and their breaking to low-energy QCD dynamics, laying also foundations for modern elementary particle physics and the Standard Model. This article is an overview of eight decades of experimental and theoretical meson production physics, from isospin to charm and beyond, forming our understanding of hadrons and their interactions.</description>

      <title>How to Deep-Learn the Theory behind Quark-Gluon Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet taggers provide an ideal testbed for applying explainability techniques to powerful ML tools. For theoretically and experimentally challenging quark-gluon tagging, we first identify the leading latent features that correlate strongly with physics observables, both in a linear and a non-linear approach. Next, we show how Shapley values can assess feature importance, although the standard implementation assumes independent inputs and can lead to distorted attributions in the presence of correlations. Finally, we use symbolic regression to derive compact formulas to approximate the tagger output.</description>

      <title>Reheating after the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories with radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) lead to first-order phase transitions and the production of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes if the supercooling period lasted long enough. Here we explain how to efficiently reheat the universe after such period in the above-mentioned class of theories. Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.</description>

      <title>Radion Portal Freeze-Out Dark-Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in a consistent model of a stabilized extra-dimensional theory, the radion can serve as a natural portal between ordinary matter and WIMP dark matter. With an effective coupling scale of the Kaluza-Klein theory of 20-100 TeV, the radion portal can produce the observed relic abundance through resonant annihilation for dark matter masses up to a TeV. Existing and planned direct dark matter detection experiments cannot constrain this model. However, indirect detection limits exclude dark matter masses between 5 and 80 GeV, where the radion mediator primarily decays into b-quarks.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the nucleon in the Skyrme model based on scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the QCD scale anomaly in the gravitational form factors of the nucleon -- particularly the $D(t)$ form factor -- as well as the associated stress distribution and internal forces, using a Skyrme model based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory. A distinctive feature of this model is the inclusion of both the pion and the scalar meson, which respectively capture the effects of the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly. By varying the mass of the scalar meson, we evaluate the sensitivity of the gluonic scale anomaly to the nucleon properties. We find that the gluonic scale anomaly plays a crucial role in satisfying the stability conditions of the nucleon and provides an internal confining force. Moreover, we also evaluate the momentum-transfer dependence of $D(t)$, which closely reproduces the lattice QCD results. With an appropriate choice of the anomalous dimension associated with the quark mass, its forward-limit value (i.e., the D-term) also matches the lattice data well.</description>

      <title>Scotogenic mechanism from an extended $\boldsymbol{SU(2)_1 \times SU(2)_2 \times U(1)_Y}$ electroweak symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model in which the gauge group $SU(2)_L$ is promoted to $SU(2)_1 \times SU(2)_2$. This framework naturally includes a viable dark matter candidate and generates neutrino masses radiatively \`a la Scotogenic. Our scenario can be viewed as an ultraviolet extension of the Scotogenic mechanism, addressing some of its shortcomings. The resulting phenomenology may be probed through a range of experimental signatures, from precision electroweak measurements to searches for lepton flavor violation.</description>

      <title>Finding BSM Needles in Electromagnetic Haystacks at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, motivated by several beyond the Standard Model signal topologies, we perform detailed background mitigation analyses for the DUNE near detector. Specifically, we investigate $e^+ e^-$, $e^- \gamma$, $\gamma$, and $\gamma\gamma$ final states that may arise from long-lived particles, including light mediators, dark matter, heavy neutral leptons, and axion-like particles (ALPs), decaying or scattering inside the liquid argon detector. To this end, we employ both photophilic and leptophilic ALPs as phenomenological benchmarks. The aforementioned final states leave a hard electromagnetic signature with no hadronic activity above the detector energy thresholds. Nevertheless, such signatures are not immune to backgrounds from neutrino scattering in the detector, which are in the focus of our study. In order to model realistic experimental analyses, we take into account particle misidentification rates, cross-contamination effects, and detector responses. We calculate confidence limit projections for DUNE, thereby presenting realistic capabilities for constraining or discovering new physics manifested through electromagnetic showers.</description>

      <title>Attractors Without Scaling: Adiabatic Hydrodynamization With and Without Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the process of hydrodynamization in kinetic theories of gluons undergoing boost-invariant expansion using the Adiabatic Hydrodynamization (AH) framework. We study both number-conserving and non-conserving theories, and find that including number non-conserving inelastic scattering processes restores many qualitative features of hydrodynamization in QCD EKT despite the simplicity of our model. In particular, introducing inelastic scattering results in a more realistic hydrodynamization time. With or without number non-conservation, we find that first-order hydrodynamics becomes applicable at the same time that a unique ground state emerges in the dynamical evolution of the one-particle distribution function. Furthermore, we find a set of low-effective-energy attractor modes which evolve adiabatically long before hydrodynamization, and find that the emergence of a gap between these ground state modes and the excited modes coincides with the time at which the system falls onto an attractor surface. Strikingly, this is the case even in the absence of pre-thermal scaling of the gluon distribution function, which has previously been strongly associated with pre-thermal attractor behavior. Finally, motivated by a generic feature we observe in the spectrum, we show that as the system hydrodynamizes, the rapid decoupling of non-hydrodynamic modes in boost-invariant kinetic theory can be understood with the AH framework in a model-independent fashion.</description>

      <title>Quantum Aspects of Natural Top Quark Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In top quark condensation the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state. With a UV completion of a single coloron exchange interaction, a recent semiclassical treatment gave a novel theory of the BEH boson as an extended object with composite scale $M_0\sim 6$ TeV. Presently we obtain the semiclassical theory as an effective action, using the source/Legendre transformation techniques of Jackiw, \etal, and fermion loop effects in the large-$N_c$ limit by deploying an auxiliary field to implement the sum of leading fermion loop diagrams. The theory remains natural at the loop level, with fine tuning at the level of a few \%, and the effective coupling of the 4-fermion interaction, $\bar{g}_0^2$, is significantly enhanced by quantum loops over the fundamental coloron coupling, $g_0^2$. Hence a relatively weaker ``topcolor'' theory can produce critical coupling in the effective BEH bound state theory.</description>

      <title>Laser-assisted Light-by-Light Scattering in Born-Infeld and Axion-like Particle Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision measurements of well-known light-by-light reactions lead to important insights of nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED) vacuum polarization. The laser of an intense electromagnetic field strength provides an essential tool for exploring nonlinear QED and new physics beyond Standard Model in the high-precision frontier. In this work, we propose to search for low-energy light-by-light scattering in the collision of a photon beam and a laser pulse of classical background field. We aim to investigate the impact of Born-Infeld (BI) and axion-like particle (ALP) theories on laser-assisted light-by-light scattering. We calculate the QED light-by-light scattering cross section using complete QED helicity amplitudes, and then combine them with the amplitudes in BI or ALP theory to evaluate the total cross section. The sensitivity of laser-assisted light-by-light scattering to BI and ALP parameters is presented.</description>

      <title>Relativistic effects in $\mbox{M1}$ radiative decays of heavy-light mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the $\mbox{M1}$ radiative transitions $D^*\rightarrow D\gamma$, $D_{s}^*\rightarrow D_s\gamma$, $B^*\rightarrow B\gamma$, and $B^*_{s}\rightarrow B_s\gamma$. A relativistic potential model is proposed. The corresponding Hamiltonian, when expanded to terms of the order of $v^2/c^2$, where $v$ are the quark velocities, coincides with the Breit Hamiltonian. This model allows making predictions for the widths of radiative transitions of mesons with one light quark. Taking into account relativistic effects is especially important for the transitions $D_{s}^{*+}\rightarrow D_s^+\gamma$ and $D^{*+}\rightarrow D^+\gamma$, where there is a large compensation in the magnitude of the magnetic moment of these mesons. Our results are consistent with known experimental data.</description>

      <title>Probing top-quark electroweak couplings indirectly at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top quark electroweak interactions serve as a sensitive probe for beyond-Standard-Model physics, potentially exhibiting significant deviations from Standard Model predictions and offering crucial tests of fundamental symmetries in ultraviolet physics. This Letter investigates their measurement through deep inelastic scattering (DIS) processes involving top quark loops at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory framework. We demonstrate that left-handed electron beam polarization can significantly enhance DIS cross sections for these interactions compared to right-handed scenario, highlighting the pivotal role of high polarization at the EIC in constraining these couplings. Compared to direct $pp \to t\bar{t}Z$ measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), DIS measurements could significantly improve these coupling constraints and effectively resolve parameter space degeneracies present in LHC data. Moreover, the expected precision from the EIC's high-luminosity phase matches that of LEP electroweak precision measurements, underscoring the EIC's significant potential to probe top quark properties.</description>

      <title>Thermal History of Non-equilibrated Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar fields in the early Universe are mostly discussed in two limits: either in equilibrium or completely decoupled. In this work we discuss scenarios where there are scalar fields that are not in equilibrium, but for which the coupling to thermal bath leads to interesting non-trivial dynamics. For example, in theories where scalar fields control the effective couplings of the theory, such out-of-equilibrium behavior can lead to cases where the couplings vary during cosmological evolution. We systematically examine the generic features governing the evolution of these couplings, and as an application we highlight a novel effect where the scalar quartic coupling of an Abelian Higgs model is modified, leading to stronger cosmological phase transitions than would be obtained for static non-evolving quartics.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the KM3-230213A PeV Neutrino Event via Vector Dark Matter Decay and Its Multi-Messenger Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21534v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A with a reconstructed energy of $220^{+570}_{-110}$ PeV, the most energetic astrophysical neutrino ever detected. The absence of convincing electromagnetic counterparts motivates exploration of exotic origins beyond standard astrophysical processes. We present a vector dark matter model based on a new $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry to interpret this event through superheavy dark matter decay. Our analysis demonstrates that dark matter lifetimes in the range $7.3 \times 10^{28}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{30}$ s can successfully account for the KM3-230213A event while satisfying stringent constraints from gamma-ray observations. Moreover, the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_X$ in our model naturally predicts cosmic string formation, generating a stochastic gravitational wave background with string tension $4.5 \times 10^{-11} \lesssim G\mu \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$, consistent with recent pulsar timing array observations. This multi-messenger consistency across neutrinos, gamma-rays, and gravitational waves validates our vector dark matter interpretation of the KM3-230213A event while providing testable predictions for upcoming multi-wavelength experiments.</description>

      <title>Decoding the role of $\rho$ mesonic states for elucidating the $e^+e^-\to a_2(1320)\pi$ data and other reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the BESIII Collaboration observed a $\rho$-like structure $Y(2044)$ in $e^+e^-\to a_2(1320)\pi$, suggesting that $Y(2044)$ may be a candidate of vector meson $\rho(2D)$ by comparing resonance parameters. However, the theoretical prediction for the combined branching ratio $\Gamma_{e^+e^-}\mathcal{B}_{a_2(1320)\pi}$ for the pure $\rho(2D)$ state is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental value. Resolving this discrepancy and deciphering the nature of $Y(2044)$ is a primary objective of this work. Based on a systematic study of the mass spectrum and decay properties of $\rho$ meson states around 2 GeV within the $S$-$D$ mixing framework, we reanalyzed the cross section of $e^+e^-\to a_2(1320)\pi$, and found that the aforementioned branching ratio discrepancy can be resolved. Our results show that the $Y(2044)$ structure can be reproduced by introducing four theoretically predicted $S$-$D$ mixing $\rho$ meson states $\rho_{3S-2D}^{\prime}$, $\rho_{3S-2D}^{\prime\prime}$, $\rho_{4S-3D}^{\prime}$, and $\rho_{4S-3D}^{\prime\prime}$ as intermediate resonances, in which dominant contribution arises from $\rho_{3S-2D}^{\prime\prime}$ and their inference effect is also significant. Furthermore, we reanalyzed five additional isospin vector processes $e^+e^-\to \omega\pi^0$, $e^+e^-\to f_1(1285)\pi^+\pi^-$, $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$, $e^+e^-\to \rho \eta$, and $e^+e^-\to \eta^{\prime} \pi^+\pi^-$ based on the same $S$-$D$ mixing framework, and simultaneously reproduced their experimental cross section data. This work provides a unified framework to elucidate all observed $\rho$-like structures near 2 GeV in the $e^+e^-$ annihilation processes, and suggests that the $S$-$D$ mixing effect may be crucial for understanding the mass spectrum and decay behaviors of the higher $\rho$ meson states.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis of axion-like particle emission via nonlinear Compton-like scattering in intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production of axion-like particles through nonlinear Compton-like scattering in intense laser fields using the Baier-Katkov operator method. By explicitly constructing the eikonal spinor wave function, we utilize the semiclassical nature of relativistic electrons, which simplifies the theoretical derivation and circumvents the need to evaluate certain operator products. The electron spin-resolved axion emission rate is obtained under the local constant field approximation, with explicit calculations demonstrating that transverse acceleration dominates the radiation yields. The electron spin dependence of the axion emission rate is found to differ significantly from that of photon emission by analytically examining the asymptotic behavior of the radiation in both the weak- and strong-field limits and by numerically exploring the intermediate regime. The derived spin-resolved axion emission rate can be directly incorporated into existing semiclassical Monte Carlo algorithms developed for strong-field photon processes, enabling efficient modeling of axion-like particle generation. Our results provide promising avenues for the experimental detection and control of axion-like particles with high-intensity laser facilities.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Axion Generation with Controllable Emission Angles in Strong Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate axion production in the collision between a spin-polarized relativistic electron beam and an ultraintense laser pulse. A spin-resolved Monte Carlo framework is developed to model axion-electron and axion-photon couplings in arbitrary electromagnetic fields, using quantum emission probabilities under the local constant field approximation. Owing to spin-dependent asymmetries in radiation probability, the emitted axions acquire a characteristic angular deflection tied to the initial electron polarization. This spin-dependent asymmetry enables control over the axion emission direction by adjusting the polarization of the electron beam and laser field. Simulations show that a dense and collimated axion beam ($\sim 10^{10} g_{ae}^2$) with a tunable deflection angle ($\sim$ mrad) can be produced within tens of femtoseconds using current laser technology. Our results establish a novel mechanism for manipulating axion trajectories and open a promising route toward laboratory-based searches for the axion-electron coupling.</description>

      <title>One-Point energy correlator inside jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21613v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new jet observable, the one-point energy correlators (EC), designed to characterize the in-jet energy flow distribution by measuring energy deposition at a specific angle relative to the jet axis. Building upon the transverse momentum dependent physics, we aim for the EC to provide novel insights into jet substructure and offer a new approach to study TMD physics, particularly gluon transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions (TMDFFs) which are notoriously difficult to extract. We obtain the factorization of the EC jet function within Soft-Collinear Effective Theory and leverage the framework of semi-inclusive TMD fragmenting jet functions. We resum large global logarithms and non-global logarithms (NGLs) and show that the normalized EC jet function exhibits significantly reduced dependence on the factorization scale and is primarily sensitive to the jet scale. Finally, after incorporating non-perturbative effects, we present numerical calculations up to NNLL accuracy for global logarithms and LL accuracy for NGLs, and we compare these predictions with PYTHIA 8 simulations.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Molecules and $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ Coupled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21672v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hidden-charm exotic mesons based on a coupled-channel framework, where the physical states are described as superpositions of a compact $c\bar c$ core (identified with the $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ states) and hadronic components such as $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$. We incorporate meson exchange potentials to describe hadron-hadron interactions and determine model parameters to reproduce the observed masses of $X(3872)$ and $Z(3930)$. The model also predicts a $0^{++}$ bound state consistent with the $X(3860)$. The internal structure is found to be predominantly molecular for the $X(3872)$, while the $X(3860)$ and $Z(3930)$ have larger $c\bar{c}$ components. The coupling between $c\bar{c}$ cores and hadronic components plays a crucial role in generating these states. The resulting wave functions provide insight into the internal structure and decay properties of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of a QCD critical point and structure of the Columbia plot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quark-mass dependence of the QCD critical point at varying bare up/down quark masses with fixed strange quark mass. We explore the corresponding second-order critical surface in the three-dimensional Columbia plot and study the extension of the associated crossover hyperplane at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential. To this end, we employ a by now well-tested combination of lattice Yang--Mills theory and a (truncated) version of Dyson--Schwinger equations at $N_f=2+1$ quark flavours. We find evidence for a positive curvature of the second order surface at (large) real chemical potential and a crossover region for imaginary chemical potential. Our results support the notion of a tricritical point at finite chemical potential in the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>One-loop Renormalization of the Type-I Seesaw Model in the Modified Minimal-subtraction Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the Standard Model (SM) with three right-handed neutrinos, the type-I seesaw model serves as the simplest and most natural scenario to successfully explain both tiny neutrino masses and the baryon number asymmetry in the Universe. In this paper, we perform a complete one-loop renormalization of the type-I seesaw model in the modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\rm MS}$) scheme. The one-loop self-energy corrections of charged leptons and Majorana neutrinos are calculated in the $R_\xi^{}$ gauge, and the explicit expressions of all the counterterms for wave functions, fermion masses and the leptonic flavor mixing matrix are given. Furthermore, adopting the Euler-like parametrization of the $6\times 6$ unitary leptonic flavor mixing matrix, we derive one-loop renormalization-group equations for all the physical parameters in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme, including neutrino masses, mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The modification of the one-loop renormalization of the original SM parameters due to the presence of heavy Majorana neutrinos is investigated as well. In this way, we provide a self-consistent theoretical framework to thoroughly test the type-I seesaw model at the one-loop level with future precision data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of the chiral phase transition in a soft-wall AdS/QCD model, of which the mass plane phase diagram from equilibrium calculation is qualitatively consistent with the so-called Columbia plot. By directly solving the non-equilibrium evolution of the order parameter of the chiral phase transition, i.e. the chiral condensate, we study the thermalization of the QCD matter in different regions of the quark mass plane. It is shown that, when the system is close to the transition region, the thermalization process will show non-trivial behavior in the intermediate time region.</description>

      <title>Net-Charge Fluctuations in Finite Volume PNJL Model: A Probe for the QCD Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD Critical Point is a pivotal feature of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. Signatures of the critical point are expected to manifest through the non-monotonic behavior of higher-order moments of conserved quantities, such as net-baryon ($\Delta B$), net-charge ($\Delta Q$), and net-strangeness ($\Delta S$), as a function of collision energy. These moments are connected to the thermodynamic susceptibilities, as well as to the correlation length developed in the system, which diverges at the critical point. The non-monotonic behavior of higher-order moments and their volume-independent products near the critical region supports the presence of a critical point in a finite system existing for a finite time, due to their sensitivity to critical fluctuations. These fluctuations are believed to provide key evidence in the search for the QCD Critical Point. We present the higher order moments, such as mean (M), variance $(\sigma^2)$, skewness (S), and kurtosis $(\kappa)$ and their volume-independent moment products $(M/\sigma^{2}, s\sigma, \kappa\sigma^{2})$ of net-charge multiplicity distributions in the three-flavor finite volume, finite density Polyakov loop enhanced Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. The work has been performed at energies similar to RHIC BES energies from 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV, including 2.4 and 3 GeV in the present model. Our findings are compared with the STAR net-charge data at various collision energies to explore signals of the QCD critical point. Additionally, we contrast our results with predictions from the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model, the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model, and available lattice QCD data. The present results offer a useful tool for extracting the freeze-out parameters in the heavy-ion collision by comparing them with the STAR net-charge result and other net-charge theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computation of diboson production in the $W^\pm Z$ channel at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), incorporating leptonic decays of the gauge bosons and considering intermediate gauge bosons with definite polarization states. The analysis includes contributions from the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) and is carried out at next-to-leading order accuracy in QCD, matched to a parton-shower simulation. Our implementation allows for the selection of specific helicity configurations, both in the Standard Model and in the presence of dimension-six operators inducing anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings. This work provides a key ingredient for both polarization-template and quantum-tomography analyses of diboson systems at the LHC within the SMEFT framework.</description>

      <title>Superradiance Constraints from GW231123</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations have recently revealed with high significance, and high precision, the existence of $\mathcal{O}(100) \, M_\odot$ rapidly rotating black holes, allowing gravitational wave events to be used for the first time to probe unexplored axion parameter space using the phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. Here, we present new limits on axions using the binary black hole merger event GW231123, whose constituent black holes are among the fastest spinning observed with gravitational waves to date. We demonstrate that the most viable binary formation channels lead to conservative constraints on axion masses $\mu \sim [0.6-5] \times \, 10^{-13}$ eV and decay constants $f_\Phi \gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, extending existing superradiance constraints derived using x-ray observations to yet lower axion masses.</description>

      <title>How cross section fluctuations affect multiplicity and geometry in pA collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new Monte Carlo Glauber model is developed for pA collisions. It uses the hadronic cross sections calculated within the KMR model as implemented in the SHRiMPS minimum bias module of the SHERPA event generator. These cross sections are obtained as functions of impact parameter and, therefore, are ready for use in a Glauber model without additional assumptions regarding their impact parameter dependence. We compare the results obtained with those from a Black Disk model and from another model with colour fluctuations. It is shown that the KMR/SHRiMPS cross sections may present very good descriptions of the multiplicity distributions in pA collisions given that they show a long tail in the distribution of wounded nucleons. Moreover, it is shown that they also increase the anisotropy in the spacial distribution of wounded nucleons, which can be important in the description of the initial states of pA collisions. The generalization to A+A collisions is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Neutrino non-radiative decay in matter: constraints and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos, being massive, can decay. A heavier neutrino could decay into a lighter one and a massless scalar or pseudoscalar boson, such as the Majoron. Two-body non-radiative decay could occur in dense matter, such as in the inner dense regions of a core-collapse supernova. We first derive novel bounds on neutrino-Majoron couplings using the spectral distortions induced by neutrino non-radiative two-body decay in matter, and two-dimensional likelihood analyses of the 24 $\bar{\nu}_e$ events from SN1987A. We then explore the prospects of neutrino-Majoron couplings from a future galactic core-collapse supernova, leaving either a neutron star or a black-hole. To this aim, we use information from detailed one-dimensional supernova simulations. We consider the supernova neutrino signal associated with inverse-beta decay in the upcoming JUNO and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors, with neutrino-argon scattering in DUNE, or with coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering in the DARWIN experiment. In a full 3$\nu$ framework, based on the spectral distortions induced by neutrino decay in matter, we perform two-dimensional likelihood analyses and provide prospects for the limits on neutrino-Majoron couplings. Our results show that the observation of a future supernova will significantly improve on the current bounds, in particular from SN1987A and neutrinoless double-beta decay. Finally, we explore the impact of neutrino decay in matter on the diffuse supernova neutrino background formed by past supernova explosions. We show for the first time that the effects on black-hole contributions are important and modify the DSNB number of events by several tens of percent in Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Infrared singularities and the collinear limits of multi-leg scattering amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes are expected to admit a factorised structure in special kinematic limits, such as the Regge, soft and collinear limits. However, less is known about the precise mechanisms through which factorisation of $n$-particle scattering amplitudes is realised at high perturbative orders, where more complex structures arise. Starting with the soft anomalous dimension, in this work we investigate the multi-particle collinear limits of massless amplitudes at three- and four-loop orders. Using colour conservation and rescaling symmetry, we show how strict collinear factorisation of multiple massless final-state coloured particles is realised, and provide results for the corresponding splitting amplitude soft anomalous dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate through four loops that the conditions on the structure of the soft anomalous dimension that are required by strict collinear factorisation in all two-particle collinear limits, are sufficient to guarantee such factorisation also in any multiple collinear limit. Then, assuming that strict collinear factorisation of massless partons holds also for amplitudes containing massive coloured particles, we derive new constraints on the soft anomalous dimension from multi-collinear limits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In particle physics the world is described by a function, the Lagrangian. Each of its sectors characterizes the interactions between the particles of the Standard Model (SM). The addition of hypothetical new particles is done by including new terms in the Lagrangian. The scalar or Higgs sector of the SM is built with only one scalar complex field and it is extended by including new spin zero fields. This can help to solve questions that cannot be answered by the SM alone, like introducing dark matter candidates or new sources of CP-violation required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. The corresponding theories have to be probed experimentally. For the high energy region, the standard tools are collider experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider, or other possible future facilities. Dark matter experiments scrutinize the connection between the visible and the dark world.</description>

      <title>Neural network extraction of chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic gluon masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a neural network approach to separate the contributions of chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic gluons within the quasi-particle framework. Using dual residual networks, we extract temperature-dependent masses from SU(3) lattice thermodynamic data of pressure and trace anomaly. After incorporating physics regularizations, the trained models reproduce lattice results with high accuracy over $T/T_c \in [1,10]$, capturing both the crossover behavior near $T_c$ and linear scaling at high temperatures. The extracted masses exhibit a physically reasonable behavior: they decrease sharply around $T_c$ and increase linearly thereafter. We find significant differences between thermal and screening masses near $T_c$, reflecting non-perturbative dynamics, while they converge at $T \gtrsim 2T_c$.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Material Effects in Undulator-Based LSW Searches for Dark Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark photon is one of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model and provides a minimal laboratory for quantum-mechanical phenomena. Light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) searches often adopt the dark photon-photon oscillation formula as if the sensitivity were independent of the light source, the wall, and the surrounding medium. In this paper, I revisit an LSW experiment whose light source is an undulator and systematically include various quantum effects: finite wave packets, kinematical suppression due to the microscopic structure of the source, and mixing suppression/enhancement in the wall and the air. We find that the resulting sensitivities deviate significantly from those obtained with the na\"{i}ve oscillation formula, especially depending on the mass of the dark photon, relevant to reflective index of the medium or walls, there can be resonance effects enhancing the sensitivity significantly. Accounting for these effects, we show that placing a photon detector outside the shielding along the beamline of a synchrotron facility enables an economical, parasitic LSW search for dark photons.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetry breaking in Georgi-Glashow chiral-gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical symmetry breaking in a class of chiral gauge theories containing the Georgi-Glashow model. These theories feature a gauge sector and two fermion species that transform in the two-index antisymmetric and antifundamental representations with different multiplicities. Using the effective action formalism and the functional renormalization group, we derive the flow of four-fermion interactions that encode their resonant structure and information about bound-state formation. Generalizing the theories to multiple generations, we make contact with the loss of asymptotic freedom and dissect the boundary of a conjectured conformal window. Our results show that, while most of the theory space displays a dominant color-breaking condensate, there exists a strongly coupled regime where the lowest-laying mechanisms fail and more intricate dynamics are expected to arise. This analysis provides a first step toward the infrared behavior of chiral gauge theories with functional methods.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double copy in Regge asymptotics: from $2\rightarrow n$ amplitudes to radiation in shockwave collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures discuss multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at ultrarelativistic energies, their double copy relations, and strong parallels in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation. The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized propagators satisfying double copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg's soft theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent semi-hard saturation scale. A Color Glass Condensate EFT, and renormalization group equations in this framework, describe wee parton correlations, and their rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and hadron-hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by Cutkosky's rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in this framework has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a similar correspondence applicable to gluon and graviton shockwave propagators. Possible extensions of this double copy are outlined for computing multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of geodesics.</description>

      <title>Confronting infrared divergences in de Sitter: loops, logarithms and the stochastic formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-established result in quantum field theory in four-dimensional de Sitter space is that the vacuum state of a massless scalar field breaks the de Sitter isometry group, leading to time-dependent (secular) growth in correlation functions computed in inflationary coordinates. This behavior is widely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar fields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is thought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic formalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these infrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial distinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected by a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former, the shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in which secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although correlation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they remain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the structure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in the soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level correlators. In fact, using a de Sitter-invariant renormalization scheme based on Wilson's axioms for integration, these divergences can be systematically removed order by order. We therefore conclude that neither massless nor light scalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit genuine secular growth. We further discuss the implications of these findings for the validity and scope of the stochastic approach to inflation.</description>

      <title>The Non-Abelian Casimir Effect for Plates, Symmetrical Tube and Box on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D in the confined and deconfined phase. For the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D are explored and we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical tube and symmetrical box is attractive. The Casimir potential for the tube differs from the massless non-interacting scalar field theory prediction, where a repulsive Casimir potential is expected. Unlike the parallel plate geometry where the plate-size is fixed, in the case of the tube and box, the sizes of the faces forming the walls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We propose various methods that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating the boundaries. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a deconfined phase does not alter the Casimir potential. This observation is consistent with prior work suggesting that the region inside the walls is a boundary induced deconfined phase.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics with multiple charges and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the connection between thermodynamic and dynamical instabilities in relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple flavours of conserved U(1) charges. In theories with positive hydrodynamic entropy production, where the underlying perfect fluid has a positive speed of sound squared and satisfies the null energy condition, we show that hydrodynamic instabilities can arise only through negative diffusion coefficients associated with the U(1) charges. The onset of such instabilities is governed by the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic Hessian matrix, while the flavour-space polarisations of the unstable diffusion modes are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. We illustrate this connection using strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite densities of the three U(1) R-charges. In the dual holographic description, the five-dimensional STU black brane exhibits unstable quasinormal modes precisely at the onset of thermodynamic instability. We derive analytic expressions for the R-charge diffusion coefficients in several representative cases, including the configuration with three equal chemical potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a benchmark framework developed by and for the scientific community to evaluate, monitor and steer large language model development in fundamental physics. Building on philosophical concepts of scientific understanding and creativity, we develop a scoring system in which each question is scored by an expert for its correctness, difficulty, and surprise. The questions are of three forms: (i) multiple-choice questions for conceptual understanding, (ii) analytical problems requiring mathematical derivation, and (iii) openended tasks requiring complex problem solving. Our current dataset contains diverse set of examples, including a machine learning challenge to classify high-energy physics events, such as the four top quark signal. To ensure continued relevance, we propose a living benchmark, where physicists contribute questions, for instance alongside new publications. We invite contributions via: http://www.physicsbenchmarks.org/. We hope that this benchmark will enable a targeted AI development that can make a meaningful contribution to fundamental physics research.</description>

      <title>Chromo: A High-Performance Python Interface to Hadronic Event Generators for Collider and Cosmic-Ray Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of hadronic and nuclear interactions are essential in both collider and astroparticle physics. The Chromo package provides a unified Python interface to multiple widely used hadronic event generators, including EPOS, DPMJet, Sibyll, QGSJet, and Pythia. Built on top of their original Fortran and C++ implementations, Chromo offers a zero-overhead abstraction layer suitable for use in Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or from the command line, while preserving the performance of direct calls to the generators. It is easy to install via precompiled binary wheels distributed through PyPI, and it integrates well with the Scientific Python ecosystem. Chromo supports event export in HepMC, ROOT, and SVG formats and provides a consistent interface for inspecting, filtering, and modifying particle collision events. This paper describes the architecture, typical use cases, and performance characteristics of Chromo and its role in contemporary astroparticle simulations, such as in the MCEq cascade solver.</description>

      <title>Probing ALP-Photon Mixing with High-Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) provide a compelling avenue for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In astrophysical magnetized plasmas an ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ induces energy-dependent oscillations in the photon survival probability that imprint modulations on emission spectra. X-ray observations of bright spectrally-smooth sources can provide particularly sensitive probes of ultralight ALPs with masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV due to long propagation distances, strong magnetic fields and high photon statistics. We present a comprehensive forecast of ALP-photon conversion in three representative systems: (i) background active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through foreground intracluster magnetic fields, (ii) central AGNs within their host cluster halos and (iii) Galactic X-ray binaries viewed through the Milky Way field. Using detailed simulations we assess the prospective sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray missions including XRISM, Athena, and Arcus. For typical magnetic field configurations a 5 Ms XRISM observation of the Perseus Cluster AGN NGC 1275 can reach down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV, while Athena's superior energy resolution improves this reach by a factor of $\sim 3$. We quantify the impact of magnetic field modeling, photon statistics, and spectral binning strategies. Our results demonstrate the scientific potential of high-resolution X-ray observations to probe photon-ALP coupling in previously inaccessible parameter space, offering a powerful window into physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major task in particle physics is the measurement of rare signal processes. Even modest improvements in background rejection, at a fixed signal efficiency, can significantly enhance the measurement sensitivity. Building on prior research by others that incorporated physical symmetries into neural networks, this work extends those ideas to include additional physics-motivated features. Specifically, we introduce energy-dependent particle interaction strengths, derived from leading-order SM predictions, into modern deep learning architectures, including Transformer Architectures (Particle Transformer), and Graph Neural Networks (Particle Net). These interaction strengths, represented as the SM interaction matrix, are incorporated into the attention matrix (transformers) and edges (graphs). Our results in event classification show that the integration of all physics-motivated features improves background rejection by $10\%-40\%$ over baseline models, with an additional gain of up to $9\%$ due to the SM interaction matrix. This study also provides one of the broadest comparisons of event classifiers to date, demonstrating how various architectures perform across this task. A simplified statistical analysis demonstrates that these enhanced architectures yield significant improvements in signal significance compared to a graph network baseline.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript we confirm the presence of a Rindler horizon at CERN-NA63 by exploring its thermodynamics induced by the Unruh effect in their high energy channeling radiation experiments. By linking the entropy of the emitted radiation to the photon number, we find the measured spectrum to be a simple manifestation of the second law of Rindler horizon thermodynamics and thus a direct measurement of the recoil Fulling-Davies-Unruh (FDU) temperature. Moreover, since the experiment is born out of an ultra-relativistic positron, and the FDU temperature is defined in the proper frame, we find that temperature boosts as a length and thus fast objects appear colder. The spectrum also provides us with a simple setting to measure fundamental constants, and we employ it to measure the positron mass.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Phenomenology of Very Special Relativity: From Subatomic Particles to Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the implications of Lorentz-violating (LV) theories, focusing on Very Special Relativity (VSR) and its phenomenological consequences. Initially presented as an alternative mechanism for neutrino masses, VSR has since become a significant part of the general LV framework, distinguished by its unique group structure and non-local operators. After a comprehensive introduction to the principles of LV and VSR, we present the corresponding modifications to the Dirac equation. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a Hamiltonian formalism within the VSR context, addressing its inherent non-localities. This approach is further extended to the non-relativistic limit, connecting it to the conventional Schr\"odinger picture. We then set upper bounds on the VSR parameters by examining its corrections to a wide range of physical systems and scenarios, such as Landau levels of charged particles, the $\mathsf g-$factor of electrons, the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field, and the gravitational emission from binary stars. The latter analysis led us to the construction of a VSR field theory for spin-2 fields in flat space, which was surprisingly found to accommodate a gauge-invariant graviton mass. Through this comprehensive study, we bridged theoretical predictions with experimental data, paving the way for future explorations in Lorentz-violating theories and highlighting their potential to address unresolved questions in modern physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics does not explain the origin of the universe's baryon asymmetry or its primordial fluctuations. The Affleck-Dine mechanism is a well-motivated scenario for generating the baryon asymmetry through the post-inflationary dynamics of a complex scalar field with baryon number. The curvaton mechanism is a popular approach for producing curvature perturbations through the dynamics of a light spectator field which decays after inflation. We demonstrate that the same complex field can viably perform both roles without any modifications to the minimal realization of Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. This scenario can also accommodate appreciable levels of primordial non-Gaussianity, beyond those achievable with only a real-valued curvaton field, and may be observable with future CMB experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a simple dark sector extension where the observed dark matter (DM) abundance arises from a freeze-in process through the decay of heavy vector-like quarks into a scalar dark matter candidate. The detection prospects of such DM are challenging due to the feeble nature of the interactions, but these vector-like quarks can be produced copiously at the LHC, where they decay to Standard Model quarks along with DM. Depending on the decay rate, this scenario is typically probed through long-lived particle or displaced vertex signatures, assuming a radiation-dominated background. An alternative hypothesis suggests that the Universe may have experienced a rapid expansion phase instead of the standard radiation-dominated one during freeze-in. This would significantly alter the dark matter phenomenology, requiring a substantial increase in the interaction rate to match the observed relic density, resulting in the rapid decay of the parent particle. As a result, much of the parameter space for this scenario is beyond the reach of traditional long-lived particle and displaced vertex searches. Due to this non-standard cosmic evolution, existing constraints do not cover the expanded dark matter parameter space. We propose a complementary search strategy to explore this scenario, offering additional limits alongside searches for long-lived particles and displaced vertices. In our search, we investigate the FIMP dark matter model at the LHC using boosted fatjets and significant missing transverse momentum. To improve precision, we include one-loop QCD corrections for LHC production processes and employ a boosted decision tree multivariate analysis, leveraging jet substructure variables to explore a vast parameter space for this minimally extended FIMP dark matter model at the 14 TeV LHC.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis Force on Diffusion of D Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have attempted to calculate and estimate the spatial diffusion coefficients of D meson through rotating hadron resonance gas, which can be produced in the late stage of peripheral heavy ion collisions. Employing the framework of kinetic theory in relaxation time approximation, and using Einstein's diffusion relation, one can express the spatial diffusion coefficients of D meson as a ratio of its conductivity to its susceptibility. Here, we have tuned D meson relaxation time from the knowledge of earlier works on its spatial diffusion estimations, and then we have extended the framework for the finite rotation picture of hadronic matter, where only the effect of Coriolis force is considered. Our study also revealed the anisotropic nature of diffusion in the presence of rotation with future possibilities of phenomenological signature.</description>

      <title>New Limits on Ultralight Axionlike Dark Matter from Reanalyzed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New limits on the axion-nucleon coupling over the axion mass region $10^{-24} \leq m_a \leq 5 \times 10^{-21}$ eV are derived by reanalyzing data from laboratory measurements on Lorentz and $CPT$ violation. These results establish the first laboratory constraints on the axion-nucleon coupling for axion masses below $10^{-22}$ eV. For $10^{-22} \leq m_a \leq 5 \times 10^{-21}$ eV, the results improve upon previous laboratory limits by more than 3 orders of magnitude, exceeding for the first time the astrophysical limits from supernova SN1987A cooling. For the axion mass range of interest corresponding to ultralow frequencies, the crucial local phase of the axion field is considered. Furthermore, the obtained limits are nearly equivalent to those projected for a recently proposed experiment employing high-intensity neutron beams at the European Spallation Source. For an alternative type of axion-nucleon interaction, the quadratic wind coupling, the constraints exceed the current best results by approximately 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using unfolded top-quark decay data we can measure the top quark mass, as well as search for unexpected kinematic effects. We present a new generative unfolding method for the two tasks and show how they both benefit from unbinned, high-dimensional unfolding. Unlike weight-based or iterative generative methods we include a targeted unbiasing with respect to the training data. This shows significant advantages over standard, iterative methods, in terms of applicability, flexibility and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the influence of an early matter-dominated era in cosmic history on the dynamics of cosmic strings and the resulting stochastic gravitational waves. Specifically, we examine the case where this era originates from the dark matter dilution mechanism within the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model. By numerically solving the Boltzmann equations governing the energy densities of the relevant components, we meticulously analyze the modifications to the cosmological scale factor, the number density of cosmic string loops, and the gravitational wave spectrum. Our results reveal that the early matter-dominated era causes a characteristic suppression in the high-frequency regime of the gravitational wave spectrum, providing distinct and testable signatures for future ground-based interferometer experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of IAXO and its intermediate version, BabyIAXO, to detect axions produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Our study demonstrates that these experiments have realistic chances of identifying SN axions, offering crucial insights into both axion physics and SN dynamics. IAXO's sensitivity to SN axions allows for the exploration of regions of the axion parameter space inaccessible through solar observations. In addition, in the event of a nearby SN, $d \sim O(100)$ pc, and sufficiently large axion couplings, $g_{a \gamma} \gtrsim 10^{-11} GeV^{-1}$, IAXO could have a chance to significantly advance our understanding of axion production in nuclear matter and provide valuable information about the physics of SNe, such as pion abundance, the equation of state, and other nuclear processes occurring in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Unveils the Power Law of Finite-Volume Energy Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06496v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-volume extrapolation is an important step for extracting physical observables from lattice calculations. However, it is a significant challenge for the system with long-range interactions. We employ symbolic regression to regress finite-volume extrapolation formula for both short-range and long-range interactions. The regressed formula still holds the exponential form with a factor $L^n$ in front of it. The power decreases with the decreasing range of the force. When the range of the force becomes sufficiently small, the power converges to $-1$, recovering the short-range formula as expected. Our work represents a significant advancement in leveraging machine learning to probe uncharted territories within particle physics.</description>

      <title>Suppression of elliptic anisotropy inside jets: A new perspective for jet quenching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle azimuthal anisotropies inside jets, defined within the momentum plane perpendicular to the jet axis, carry the information of the QCD cascade process for jet formation. In this work, we propose to measure the medium-induced modifications of the elliptic anisotropy inside jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to provide novel insight into the jet quenching phenomenon. By simulating the jet propagation in the hot and dense nuclear medium with a Linear Boltzmann Transport model, we observe a de-correlation in the two-particle azimuthal angular distribution for inclusive jet production in AA collisions relative to that in pp collisions, which results in significant suppression of the in-jet elliptic anisotropy coefficient $v_2$. This phenomenon arises from the stochastic and strong interactions with the thermal QGP medium undergone by the jet particles. Furthermore, the nuclear modifications of the in-jet $v_2$ are found to be sensitive to the medium properties in the model study, which provide a potential probe for the jet tomography of nuclear matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the particle production by the Nambu-Goldstone boson in the spontaneous baryogenesis scenario for large misalignment angles. Studying numerically the case of an arbitrary initial phase, we reproduce the cubic dependence on the initial value of the phase of baryon asymmetry in the case of small oscillations and present our results for an initial phase close to {\pi}. Our calculations indicate that there is a saturation in particle production as the initial phase approaches {\pi} in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, we present numerical solutions in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in conformal time, where we demonstrate a strong dependence on the decay rate of the scalar field. We also discuss the probability distribution of the baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity: Constraints from the generalized parton distributions (GPDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory of gravity modifies general relativity in high-density regimes. It offers an alternative framework that avoids cosmological singularities and remodels gravitational dynamics within compact objects. An important feature of EiBI gravity is its additional parameter, $\kappa$, which governs deviations from standard gravitational behavior. In this study, we investigate constraints on $\kappa$ using the internal pressure distribution of the proton, derived from gravitational form factor (GFF) $ D(t) $ obtained through a QCD analysis of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). By comparing pressure profiles extracted from skewness-dependent GPDs with previous determinations based on deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) data, we establish updated bounds on $\kappa$. Our results show that the choice of proton pressure model significantly impacts the constraints, with the strongest limits ($|\kappa| \leq 0.10\text{--}0.3\, \text{m}^5\, \text{kg}^{-1}\, \text{s}^{-2}$). We further demonstrate that constraints obtained based on the first and second moments of the pressure distribution yield competitive bounds compared to those derived from peak pressures or those derived from just the first moment. These findings highlight the importance of precise experimental and theoretical determinations of the proton's mechanical properties in testing alternative theories of gravity. The present study motivates future improvements in GPD reconstructions for stronger constraints on EiBI gravity and related modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the Large Hadron Collider's Run 3 in progress, the 125 GeV Higgs boson couplings are being examined in greater detail, while searching for additional scalars. Multi-Higgs frameworks allow Higgs couplings to significantly deviate from Standard Model values, enabling indirect probes of extra scalars. We consider the possibility of large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings in the softly-broken Z2xZ2' three-Higgs doublet model with CP violating coefficients. To explore the parameter space of the model, we employ a Machine Learning algorithm that significantly enhances sampling efficiency. Using it, we find new regions of parameter space and observable consequences, not found with previous techniques. This method leverages an Evolutionary Strategy to quickly converge towards valid regions with an additional Novelty Reward mechanism. We use this model as a prototype to illustrate the potential of the new techniques, applicable to any Physics Beyond the Standard Model scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was proposed that five-dimensional (5D) inflation can blow up the size of a compact dimension from the 5D Planck length to the micron size, as required by the dark dimension proposal, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Moreover, it was shown that 5D inflation can generate the (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations. Here we compute the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and show that unlike the power spectrum, it differs from the four-dimensional case at all angular distances, due to the fact that in contrast to global dilatations, invariance under special conformal transformations is not restored at late times. Moreover there is an additional enhancement in the squeezed limit.</description>

      <title>Improved superscaling description of electron and charged-current neutrino quasielastic scattering using effective mass dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved version of the Superscaling Analysis with Relativistic Effective Mass, denoted as SuSAM-v2. In the original SuSAM model, a universal scaling function was fitted to a selected set of quasielastic electron scattering (e,e') cross section data, using a phenomenological ansatz inspired by the Relativistic Mean Field model of nuclear matter. In this work, we refine the procedure by first fitting a longitudinal scaling function directly to experimental longitudinal response data. Subsequently, a separate transverse scaling function is extracted from purely transverse data, after subtracting the longitudinal contribution already determined. We find that the resulting transverse scaling function must exhibit an explicit dependence on the momentum transfer q in order to reproduce all kinematics consistently. The resulting SuSAM-v2 model simultaneously describes inclusive quasielastic cross sections and both longitudinal and transverse response functions in electron scattering. The model is then applied to neutrino-nucleus scattering, showing an improved prediction compared to the previous SuSAM-v1 version, due to a more accurate treatment of the relative contributions of the longitudinal and transverse weak nuclear responses.</description>

      <title>Toward quantum tunneling from excited states: Recovering imaginary-time instantons from a real-time analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the path integral description of quantum tunneling and lay the groundwork for its generalization to excites states through real-time path integral techniques. For clarity, we focus on the simple toy model of a point particle in a double-well potential, for which we perform all steps explicitly. Instead of performing the familiar Wick rotation from physical to imaginary time -- which is inconsistent with the requisite boundary conditions when treating tunneling from states other than the false vacuum -- we regularize the path integral by adding an infinitesimal complex contribution to the Hamiltonian, while keeping time strictly real. We find that this gives rise to a complex stationary-phase solution, in agreement with recent insights from Picard-Lefshitz theory. We then show that there exists a class of analytic solutions for the corresponding equations of motion, which can be made to match the appropriate boundary conditions in the physically relevant limits of a vanishing regulator and an infinite physical time. We provide a detailed discussion of this non-trivial limit. We find that, for systems without an explicit time-dependence, our approach reproduces the picture of an instanton-like solution defined on a finite Euclidean-time interval. Lastly, we discuss the generalization of our approach to broader classes of systems, for which it serves as a reliable framework for high-precision calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but with vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low-energy effective field theory for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the effective field theory, we briefly discuss the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the branching fractions of $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Sigma^{+}K_{S}^{0}$, $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}\pi^{+}$, and $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}K^{+}$ at Belle and Belle II</title>

Abstract: Using 983.0 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ and 427.9 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ data samples collected with the Belle and Belle II detectors at the KEKB and SuperKEKB asymmetric energy $e^+e^-$ colliders, respectively, we present studies of the Cabibbo-favored $\Xi_c^+$ decays ${\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Sigma^{+}K_{S}^{0}}$ and $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}\pi^{+}$, and the singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}K^{+}$. The ratios of branching fractions of ${\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Sigma^{+}K_{S}^{0}}$ and $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}K^{+}$ relative to that of $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ are measured for the first time, while the ratio ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{+})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}) $ is also determined and improved by an order of magnitude in precision. The measured branching fraction ratios are $\frac{\cal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+} \to \Sigma^{+}K_{S}^{0})}{\cal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^+)}= 0.067 \pm 0.007 \pm 0.003$, $\frac{\cal{B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{0}\pi^{+})}{\cal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^+)} = 0.251 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.010$, $\frac{\cal{B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{0}K^{+})}{\cal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^+)} = 0.017 \pm 0.003 \pm 0.001$. Additionally, the ratio ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}K^{+})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{+})$ is measured to be $ 0.068 \pm 0.010 \pm 0.004$. Here, the first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. Multiplying the ratios by the branching fraction of the normalization mode, ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^+)= (2.9\pm 1.3)\%$, we obtain the following absolute branching fractions ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Sigma^{+}K^{0}_{S}) = (0.194 \pm 0.021 \pm 0.009 \pm 0.087 )%$, ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{+}) = (0.728 \pm 0.014 \pm 0.027 \pm 0.326 )%$, ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}K^{+}) = (0.049 \pm 0.007 \pm 0.003 \pm 0.022 )%$.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and instabilities in singularity-free inflation from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional gravitational theories derived from an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, combined with a conformal rescaling of the metric, are equivalent to a subclass of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories that possess a single scalar degree of freedom. Under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, the theory admits an inflationary solution that replaces the Big Bang singularity. This can be achieved by a solution where the Hubble expansion rate $H$ is equal to the time derivative of the scalar field $\dot{\phi}$. We show that the solution $H=\dot{\phi}$ suffers from a strong coupling problem, characterized by the vanishing kinetic term of linear scalar perturbations at all times. Consequently, nonlinear scalar perturbations remain uncontrolled from the onset of inflation throughout the subsequent cosmological evolution. Moreover, tensor perturbations are generally subject to Laplacian instabilities during inflation. This instability in the tensor sector also persists under background initial conditions where $H \neq \dot{\phi}$. In the latter case, both the coefficient of the kinetic term for scalar perturbations and the scalar sound speed diverge at the onset of inflation. Thus, the dominance of inhomogeneities in this theory renders the homogeneous background solution illegitimate.</description>

      <title>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Matter: Chiral Soliton Lattices in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) in the framework of holographic QCD in magnetic field. Under appropriate boundary conditions for the gauge field and the quark mass deformation, we demonstrate that the ground state in the gravitational dual of QCD is given by the CSL in the background magnetic field and the baryon number density. In the presence of the background magnetic field, we show that the CSL is interpreted as a uniformly distributed D4-branes in the holographic setup, where the chiral soliton is identified with a non-self-dual instanton vortex or a center vortex in the five dimensional bulk gauge theory. While the baryon numbers are given to chiral solitons as well as Skyrmions due to the different terms in the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term in the chiral perturbation theory, these baryon numbers with different origins are unified in terms of the instanton charge density in five dimensions. With bulk analysis of the WZW term, we find that the pion decay constant becomes dependent on the magnetic field. For the massless pion case, we obtain an analytical form that is in qualitative agreement with lattice QCD results for strong magnetic fields.</description>
