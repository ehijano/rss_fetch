      <title>Continuously controllable dissipative and coherent couplings by the interaction between anti-resonance and multiple magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weexperimentally realize the continuously controllable dissipative coupling and coherent coupling induced by different magnon modes and the same anti-resonance. It has been observed that the weaker the microwave magnetic field distribution of the magnon mode in magnetic materials, the more likely dissipative coupling is to occur. Conversely, stronger magnetic field distributions favor coherent coupling. Based on this principle, we have designed and implemented a system that alternates between dissipative and coherent coupling regimes. It allows microwave signals to be selectively transmitted over a large applied magnetic field range at the frequency of anti-resonance. Our experimental achievements may promote the construction of new magnonics devices like magnetic-tuning switch.</description>

      <title>Duality breaking, mobility edges, and the connection between topological Aubrey-Andr\'e and quantum Hall insulators in atomic wires with fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the Aubry-Andr{\'e} model lacks mobility edges due to its energy-independent self-duality but may exhibit edge states. When duality is broken, we show that mobility regions arise and non-trivial topological phases emerge. By varying the degree of duality breaking, we identify mobility regions and establish a connection between Aubry-Andr{\'e} atomic wires with fermions and quantum Hall systems for a family of Hamiltonians that depends on the relative phase of laser fields, viewed as a synthetic dimension. Depending on the filling factor and the degree of duality breaking, we find three classes of non-trivial phases: conventional topological insulator, conventional topological Aubry-Andr{\'e} insulator, and unconventional (hybrid) topological Aubry-Andr{\'e} insulator. Finally, we discuss appropriate Chern numbers that illustrate the classification of topological phases of localized fermions in atomic wires.</description>

      <title>Effects of valley splitting on resonant-tunneling readout of spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of valley splitting on the readout of qubit states is theoretically investigated in a three-quantum-dot (QD) system. A single unit of the three-QD system consists of qubit-QDs and a channel-QD that is connected to a conventional transistor. The nonlinear source--drain current characteristics under resonant-tunneling effects are used to distinguish different qubit states. Using nonequilibrium Green functions, the current formula for the three-QD system is derived when each QD has two valley energy levels. Two valley states in each QD are considered to be affected by variations in the fabrication process. We found that when valley splitting is smaller than Zeeman splitting, the current nonlinearity can improve the readout, provided that the nonuniformity of the valley energy levels is small. Conversely, when the valley splitting is larger than the Zeeman splitting, the nonuniformity degraded the readout. In both cases, we showed that there are regions where the measurement time $t_{\rm meas}$ is much less than the decoherence time $t_{\rm dec}$ such that $t_{\rm dec}/t_{\rm meas}&gt;100$. This suggests that less than 1\% measurement error is anticipated, which opens up the possibility for implementing surface codes even in the presence of valley splitting.</description>

      <title>Read out the fermion parity of a potential artificial Kitaev chain utilizing a transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Line Edge Roughness Effects on the Thermoelectric Properties of Armchair Black Phosphorene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the thermoelectric properties of armchair black phosphorene nanoribbons while considering the presence of line edge roughness. Employing the tight-binding method in conjunction with non-equilibrium Green's function techniques and Landauer formulas, we explore the impact of various parameters on thermoelectric performance. Our findings reveal that the electrical conductivity and, consequently, the power factor exhibit an increasing trend with expanding ribbon length and width. This behavior can be attributed to heightened collision rates, particularly in narrow ribbons, induced by line edge roughness as length increases. Remarkably, the Seebeck coefficient at the Fermi energy corresponding to the maximum power factor remains nearly constant across different widths, lengths, temperatures and transport regimes. Furthermore, the thermoelectric figure of merit demonstrates a positive correlation with both ribbon length and width. In narrow widths and lengths around 1000 nm, the power factor and figure of merit exhibit an upward trend with ribbon width. However, with further increases in ribbon width, the influence of line edge roughness on thermal conductivity diminishes. Consequently, the figure of merit decreases due to the rise in thermal conductivity. Notably, the thermoelectric figure of merit is higher for short and narrow ribbons and long and wider ribbons.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Model For Topologically-Stable Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main quantities which describe the topological properties of magnetic Skyrmion is the Skyrmion number density, $q$. In this work, we study an alternative model of a two-dimensional magnetic system where the dynamics of the spins explicitly depend on $q$ and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is omitted. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics is employed for the micromagnetic calculations and it is found that one of the possible static lowest energy configurations of the proposed model is a Skyrmion with a topological charge equal to one. This lowest energy configuration is stable under small linear perturbation and it is shown that the total energy of the system is bounded from below such that it is always higher than the vacuum energy, implying a topologically protected configuration. The alternative model is an effective model for Skyrmions in two-dimensional systems. We also propose that this model can be used for magnetic systems under a strong external magnetic field where the ordinary exchange interactions are much weaker than the Zeeman effect.</description>

      <title>Mode-Shell correspondence, a unifying phase space theory in topological physics -- part II: Higher-dimensional spectral invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mode-shell correspondence relates the number $I_M$ of gapless modes in phase space to a topological \textit{shell invariant} $\Ish$ defined on a close surface -- the shell -- surrounding those modes, namely $I_M=I_S$. In part I, we introduced the mode-shell correspondence for zero-modes of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians (class AIII). In this part II, we extend the correspondence to arbitrary dimension and to both symmetry classes A and AIII. This allows us to include, in particular, $1D$-unidirectional edge modes of Chern insulators, massless $2D$-Dirac and $3D$-Weyl cones, within the same formalism. We provide an expression of $I_M$ that only depends on the dimension of the dispersion relation of the gapless mode, and does not require a translation invariance. Then, we show that the topology of the shell (a circle, a sphere, a torus), that must account for the spreading of the gapless mode in phase space, yields specific expressions of the shell index. Semi-classical expressions of those shell indices are also derived and reduce to either Chern or winding numbers depending on the parity of the mode's dimension. In that way, the mode-shell correspondence provides a unified and systematic topological description of both bulk and boundary gapless modes in any dimension, and in particular includes the bulk-boundary correspondence. We illustrate the generality of the theory by analyzing several models of semimetals and insulators, both on lattices and in the continuum, and also discuss weak and higher-order topological phases within this framework. Although this paper is a continuation of Part I, the content remains sufficiently independent to be mostly read separately.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized STM measurement scheme for quantum geometric tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometric tensor (QGT) reflects the geometry of the eigenstates of a system's Hamiltonian. The full characterization of QGT is essential for various quantum systems. However, it is challenging to characterize the QGT of the solid-state systems. Here we present a scheme by using spin-polarized STM to measure QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems, in which the spin texture is extracted from geometric amplitudes of Friedel oscillations induced by the intentionally introduced magnetic impurity and then the QGT is derived from the momentum differential of spin texture. The surface states of topological insulator (TISS), as a model spin system, is promising to demonstrate the scheme. In a TI slab, the gapped TISS host finite quantum metric and Berry curvature as the symmetric real part and the antisymmetric imaginary part of QGT, respectively. Thus, a detailed calculations guide the use of the developed scheme to measure the QGT of gapped TISS with or without an external in-plane magnetic field. This study provides a feasible scheme for measuring QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems, and hints at the great potential of the information extraction from the geometric amplitudes of STM and other measurement.</description>

      <title>Room temperature observation of the anomalous in-plane Hall effect in epitaxial thin films of a Weyl ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically nontrivial electronic states can give rise to novel anomalous Hall effects. The potential appearance of these effects at room temperature holds promise for their application in magnetic sensing, spintronics, and energy harvesting technology. The anomalous in-plane Hall effect (IPHE) is predicted to arise in topological magnetic materials when an external magnetic field is applied within the sample plane. Because of stringent symmetry requirements, the conclusive detection of the anomalous IPHE induced by topological electronic states remains challenging, and the study of anomalous Hall effects is often confined to cryogenic conditions. Combining molecular beam epitaxy of the kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn with measurements of the electric Hall effect and theoretical calculations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that the interplay of the kagome lattice motif with spin-orbit coupling and canted ferromagnetism with large exchange interactions gives rise to the anomalous IPHE at room temperature that is induced by topological Weyl points in the electronic band structure. Synthesizing a topological heterostructure including layers of Fe$_3$Sn and ferromagnetic CoFeB, we further show the enhancement of the anomalous IPHE through the magnetic stray field of the CoFeB layer. Our work establishes a design paradigm for topological magnets and heterostructures to discover and control novel anomalous Hall effects toward their use in technological applications.</description>

      <title>Structural and Transport Properties of Thin InAs Layers Grown on InxAl1-xAs Metamorphic Buffers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium Arsenide is a III-V semiconductor with low electron effective mass, a small band gap, strong spin-orbit coupling, and a large g-factor. These properties and its surface Fermi level pinned in the conduction band make InAs a good candidate for developing superconducting solid-state quantum devices. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of very thin InAs layers with thicknesses ranging from 12.5 nm to 500 nm grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy on InxAl1-xAs metamorphic buffers. Differently than InAs substrates, these buffers have the advantage of being insulating at cryogenic temperatures, which allows for multiple device operations on the same wafer and thus making the approach scalable. The structural properties of the InAs layers were investigated by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, demonstrating the high crystal quality of the InAs layers. Furthermore, their transport properties, such as total and sheet carrier concentration, sheet resistance, and carrier mobility, were measured in the van der Pauw configuration at room temperature. A simple conduction model was employed to quantify the surface, bulk, and interface contributions to the overall carrier concentration and mobility.</description>

      <title>Topological semimetal with coexisting nodal points and nodal lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Featuring exotic quantum transport and surface states, topological semimetals can be classified into nodal-point, nodal-line, and nodal-surface semimetals according to the degeneracy and dimensionality of their nodes. The coexistence of diverse categories of topological semimetals is of particular interest as it enables the concurrent utilization of their respective beneficial features. However, topological semimetals that possess both nodal points and nodal lines are rarely reported. Here, we propose a scheme to construct this unprecedented topological semimetal, which particularly exhibits second-order hinge Fermi arcs connecting projected nodal lines. Then, by applying periodic driving on the system, we find a hybrid-order topological semimetal with nodal points and rich nodal-lines structures and its conversion into the first-order topological semimetal, which are absent in the static system. Our results enrich the family of topological semimetals, thereby establishing a foundation for further exploration into the potential applications of these materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic measurements under high pressure with a quantum sensor in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic measurements under high-pressure conditions are pivotal for the study of superconductivity and magnetic materials but remain challenging due to the micrometer-sized sample in diamond anvil cells (DAC). In this study, we propose a quantum sensing approach utilizing negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_B^-$) spin defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride for high resolution magnetic measurements under pressure. The optical and spin properties of VB$^-$ defects were systematically studied under high-pressure conditions, revealing a significant pressure-induced shift in zero-field splitting (ZFS), approximately three times larger than that of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Furthermore, we demonstrate the pressure-dependent magnetic transition and variations in the Curie temperature of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ flake using V$_B^-$ defects under pressures. Notably, the maximum operational pressure for V$_B^-$ defects was determined to be approximately 11 GPa, attributed to a structural phase transition in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This work establishes the way for two-dimensional quantum sensing technologies under high-pressure environments.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Casimir force between superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects for the first time, through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev reflection in collinear $p$-wave magnet-triplet superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon with significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. In this work, we propose a junction comprising $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets, rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to one another, enabling precise control of transport processes. We show that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) for specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and the chemical potential. Enhanced CAR is achieved when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Additionally, the conductivities exhibit Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the superconductor length exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings highlight the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental study and enhancement of CAR.</description>

      <title>Imaging Topological Defect Dynamics Mediating 2D Skyrmion Lattice Melting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are the key feature mediating 2D phase transitions. However, both resolution and tunability have been lacking to access the dynamics of the transitions. With dynamic Kerr microscopy, we directly capture the melting of a confined 2D magnetic skyrmion lattice with high resolution in real-time and -space. Skyrmions in magnetic thin films are two-dimensional, topologically non-trivial quasi-particles that provide rich dynamics as well as unique tunability as an essential ingredient for controlling phase behavior: We tune the skyrmion size and effective temperature on the fly to drive the two-step melting through an intermediate hexatic regime between the solid lattice and the isotropic liquid. We quantify the characteristic occurrence of topological defects mediating the transitions and reveal the so-far inaccessible dynamics of the lattice dislocations. The full real-time and -space imaging reveals the diffusion coefficient of the dislocations, which we find to be orders of magnitudes higher than that of the skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Field induced density wave in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the kagome lattice, electrons benefit from the simultaneous presence of band topology, flat electronic bands, and van Hove singularities, forming competing or cooperating orders. Understanding the interrelation between these distinct order parameters remains a significant challenge, leaving much of the associated physics unexplored. In the kagome superconductor KV3Sb5, which exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) state below T = 78 K, we uncover an unpredicted field-induced phase transition below 6 K. The observed transition is marked by a hysteretic anomaly in the resistivity, nonlinear electrical transport, and a change in the symmetry of the electronic response as probed via the angular dependence of the magnetoresistivity. These observations surprisingly suggest the emergence of an unanticipated broken symmetry state coexisting with the original CDW. To understand this experimental observation, we developed a theoretical minimal model for the normal state inside the high-temperature parent CDW phase where an incommensurate CDW order emerges as an instability sub-leading to superconductivity. The incommensurate CDW emerges when superconducting fluctuations become fully suppressed by large magnetic fields. Our results suggest that, in kagome superconductors, quantum states can either coexist or are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating that these are rich platforms to expose new correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Native Three-Body Interactions in a Superconducting Lattice Gauge Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While universal quantum computers remain under development, analog quantum simulators offer a powerful alternative for understanding complex systems in condensed matter, chemistry, and high-energy physics. One compelling application is the characterization of real-time lattice gauge theories (LGTs). LGTs are nonperturbative tools, utilizing discretized spacetime to describe gauge-invariant models. They hold immense potential for understanding fundamental physics but require enforcing local constraints analogous to electromagnetism's Gauss's Law. These constraints, which arise from gauge symmetries and dictate the form of the interaction between matter and gauge fields, are a significant challenge for simulators to enforce. Implementing these constraints at the hardware level in analog simulations is crucial. This requires realizing multibody interactions between matter and gauge-field elements, enabling them to evolve together while suppressing unwanted two-body interactions that violate the gauge symmetry. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel parametrically activated three-qubit interaction within a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. We experimentally demonstrate a minimal $U(1)$ spin-1/2 model with a time evolution that intrinsically satisfies Gauss's law in the system. This design serves as the foundational block for simulating LGTs on a superconducting photonic lattice.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a selective ultraviolet (UV)-ozone oxidation-chemical etching process that has been used, in combination with laser interference lithography (LIL), for the preparation of GaAs patterned substrates. Further molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of InAs results in ordered InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) arrays with high optical quality from the first layer of QDs formed on the patterned substrate. The main result is the development of a patterning technology that allows the engineering of customized geometrical displays of QDs with the same optical quality as those formed spontaneously on flat non-patterned substrates.</description>

      <title>Algebraic skin effect in two-dimensional non-Hermitian metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials have unlocked unprecedented control over light by leveraging novel mechanisms to expand their functionality. Non-Hermitian physics further enhances the tunability of non-Hermitian metamaterials (NHMs) through phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), enabling applications like directional amplification. The higher-dimensional NHSE manifests unique effects, including the algebraic skin effect (ASE), which features power-law decay instead of exponential localization, allowing for quasi-long-range interactions. In this work, we establish apparent criteria for achieving ASE in two-dimensional reciprocal NHMs with anisotropic and complex dielectric tensors. By numerically and theoretically demonstrating ASE through mismatched optical axes and geometric structures, we reveal that ASE is governed by a generalized Fermi surface whose dimensionality exceeds that of the Fermi surface. We further propose and validate a realistic photonic crystal design for ASE, which is experimentally accessible. Our recipe for ASE provides a versatile pathway for broader generalizations, including three-dimensional structures, synthetic dimensions, and other classical wave systems, paving the way for advancements in non-Hermitian photonics.</description>

      <title>Ordered InAs QDs using prepatterned substrates by monolithically integrated porous alumina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a method for obtaining site-controlled InAs quantum dots (QDs) on large areas of GaAs (0 0 1) pre-patterned surface. The patterning of the substrate is obtained by using a monolithically integrated nano-channel alumina (NCA) mask and transferring its self-ordering to the underlying GaAs substrate by continuing the anodization process once the GaAs surface is reached. After patterning, the GaAs substrate follows a low temperature process for surface preparation before epitaxial growth for QD formation. As a final result, we observe that the nanoholes act as preferential nucleation sites for InAs QD formation, with a filling factor close to unity, while the QD formation on the surface region between the pattern holes is completely suppressed.</description>

      <title>(111) Si spin qubits constructed on L point of band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (001) Si spin qubits are being intensively studied because they have structures similar to that of CMOS devices currently being produced, and thus have the advantage of utilizing state-of-the-art miniaturization, integration, and variation-reduction-technologies. However, there are still issues, such as further improvement of relaxation and decoherence time, stabilization of valley-splitting control, and reduction of the variation caused by the roughness of the interface. In this study, new measures are proposed to address these three issues. Instead of confining an electron to the minimum energy point $X_0$ of the conduction band along the band structure $\Gamma-\Delta-X$ in (001) Si crystals, we propose confining an electron to the L point along $\Gamma-\Lambda-L$ in (111) Si crystals. At the $X_0$ point, the symmetry causes spin-orbit interaction to act on the electron, and the sixfold degeneracy is lifted into a fourfold and a twofold, and the valley-splitting of the twofold conflicts with the two-level system. In the symmetry of the $L$ point, substantial spin polarization disappears, facilitating the reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, and the fourfold degeneracy is lifted to threefold and single, and the single becomes ground state. The need to increase the magnitude of the valley-splitting is exempt, allowing the electron to be controlled away from the interface, which is expected to reduce the variation caused by the roughness of the interface. Data on the confinement of an electron to the $L$ point and the control of fourfold degeneracy are needed, and it is hoped that prototype silicon spin qubits constructed on (111) Si crystals will be developed and that the proposed device structure will help implement quantum computers based on Si devices.</description>

      <title>Giant end-tunneling effect in two distinct Luttinger liquids coexisting in one quantum wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luttinger liquids occupy a special place in physics as the most understood case of essentially quantum many-body systems. The experimental mission of measuring its main prediction, power laws in observable quantities, has already produced a body of exponents in different semiconductor and metallic structures. Here, we combine tunneling spectroscopy with density-dependent transport measurements in the same quantum wires over more than two orders of magnitude in temperature to very low temperatures down to $\sim$40 mK. This reveals that, when the second 1D subband becomes populated, the temperature dependence splits into two ranges with different exponents in the power-law dependence of the conductance, both dominated by the finite-size effect of the end-tunneling process. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring the Luttinger parameters as well as the number of modes independently through spectroscopy in addition to the transport exponent in the characterization of Luttinger liquids. This opens a new pathway to unambiguous interpretation of the exponents observed in quantum wires.</description>

      <title>Overcoming temperature limitations in laser cooling using dressed states and diamond vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The established approach to laser cooling of solids relies on anti-Stokes fluorescence, for example from rare earth impurities in glass. Although successful, there is a minimum temperature to which such a process can cool set by the electronic level spacing in the impurity. We propose an alternative method which does not suffer from this limitation. Our approach relies on the formation of dressed states under strong laser driving, which generates a spectrum in which the gaps can be tuned to optimize the heat absorption. This allows for a cooling cycle which operates at any temperature with a power comparable to the maximum dictated by thermodynamic principles. While this cooling cycle will compete with heating due to non-radiative decay and other mechanisms, it could in principle allow laser cooling to temperatures which are unachievable with anti-Stokes fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Transfer matrix approach to quantum systems subject to certain Lindblad evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving for time evolution of a many particle system whose dynamics is governed by Lindblad equation is hard. We extend the use of transfer matrix approach to a class of Linblad equations that admit a closed hierarchy of two point correlators. An example that we treat is the XX spin chain, i.e., free fermions, subject to the local on-site dephasing, but can be extended to other Hermitian dissipators, e.g., non-local dephasing. We find a simple expression of the Green's function in the Laplace domain. The method can be used to get analytical results in the thermodynamic limit, for instance, to get the evolution of magnetization density and to explicitly see the cross over between the ballistic and diffusive behavior, or to show that the correlations between operators at distance $l$ decay with time as $1/t^{\lceil l/2 \rceil+1/2}$. It also provides a fast numerical method to determine the evolution of the density with a complexity scaling with the system size more favorably than in previous methods, easily allowing one to study systems with $\sim 10^6$ spins.</description>

      <title>Approach to nonequilibrium: from anomalous to Brownian diffusion via non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in experimental techniques such as single particle tracking allows to analyze both nonequilibrium properties and approach to equilibrium. There are examples showing that processes occurring at finite timescales are distinctly different than their equilibrium counterparts. In this work we analyze a similar problem of approach to nonequilibrium. We consider an archetypal model of nonequilibrium system consisting of a Brownian particle dwelling in a spatially periodic potential and driven by an external time-periodic force. We focus on a diffusion process and monitor its development in time. In the presented parameter regime the excess kurtosis measuring the Gaussianity of the particle displacement distribution evolves in a non-monotonic way: first it is negative (platykurtic form), next it becomes positive (leptokurtic form) and then decays to zero (mesokurtic form). Despite the latter fact diffusion in the long time limit is Brownian, yet non-Gaussian. Moreover, we discover a correlation between non-Gaussianity of the particle displacement distribution and transient anomalous diffusion behavior emerging for finite timescales.</description>

Abstract: We study the polarization response to the temperature gradient in insulators, known as the thermopolarization effect. We show that this response can be understood through the free energy response function to an electric field gradient, which we call Q-tensor. By using the Q-tensor, we present a unified description of the polarization responses to both electric fields and temperature gradients and derive the generalized Mott relation. Additionally, we draw an analogy with the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects. These effects are observable as the Seebeck effect where the linear size of the system is shorter than the screening length.</description>

      <title>Integer Quantum Hall Effect: Disorder, temperature, floating, and plateau width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically consider disorder and temperature effects on the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) using a variety of distinct and complementary analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, we address simple, physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there "floating" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We discuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest future experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and temperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an intricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE plateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder. Both must be considered on an equal footing in understanding IQHE experiments.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16399v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Meissner effect in non-Hermitian superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically Meissner effect in non-Hermitian systems of BCS type via superfluid stiffness. We show that depending on the values of the mean fields, chemical potential, and temperature, we obtain paramagnetic or diamagnetic Meissner effect. Notably, positive real part of the product of mean fields guarantees diamagnetic Meissner effect in an $s$-wave 3D non-Hermitian superconductor. Once the mean fields are close to being anti-Hermitian, 2D $s$-, $p_x$-, and $d$-wave superconductors exhibit interesting behaviour, including paramagnetic Meissner effect for certain parameters.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spin Thermal Hall Effect in Non-Reciprocal Photonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A transverse radiative heat flux induced by the gradient of spin angular momentum of photons in non-reciprocal systems is predicted. This thermal analog of the inverse spin Hall effect is analyzed in magneto-optical networks exhibiting C4 symmetry, under the action of spatially variable external magnetic fields. This finding opens new avenues for thermal management and energy conversion with non-reciprocal systems through a localized and dynamic control of the spin angular momentum of light.</description>

      <title>Suppressing chaos with mixed superconducting qubit devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information processing, a tension between two different tasks occurs: while qubits' states can be preserved by isolating them, quantum gates can be realized only through qubit-qubit interactions. In arrays of qubits, weak coupling leads to states being spatially localized and strong coupling to delocalized states. Here, we study the average energy level spacing and the relative entropy of the distribution of the level spacings (Kullback-Leibler divergence from Poisson and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) to analyze the crossover between localized and delocalized (chaotic) regimes in linear arrays of superconducting qubits. We consider both transmons as well as capacitively shunted flux qubits, which enables us to tune the qubit anharmonicity. Arrays with uniform anharmonicity, comprising only transmons or flux qubits, display remarkably similar dependencies of level statistics on the coupling strength. In systems with alternating anharmonicity, the localized regime is found to be more resilient to the increase in qubit-qubit coupling strength in comparison to arrays with a single qubit type. This result supports designing devices that incorporate different qubit types to achieve higher performances.</description>
