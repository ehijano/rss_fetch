      <title>A Deep Transfer Learning-Based Low-overhead Beam Prediction in Vehicle Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing transfer learning-based beam prediction approaches primarily rely on simple fine-tuning. When there is a significant difference in data distribution between the target domain and the source domain, simple fine-tuning limits the model's performance in the target domain. To tackle this problem, we propose a transfer learning-based beam prediction method that combines fine-tuning with domain adaptation. We integrate a domain classifier into fine-tuning the pre-trained model. The model extracts domain-invariant features in adversarial training with domain classifier, which can enhance model performance in the target domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transfer learning-based beam prediction method achieves better achievable rate performance than the pure fine-tuning method in the target domain, and close to those when the training is done from scratch on the target domain.</description>

      <title>On Theoretical Interpretations of Concept-Based In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover, the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally, several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.</description>

      <title>Optimal Repair of $(k+2, k, 2)$ MDS Array Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are widely used in distributed storage systems as they provide optimal fault tolerance for a given amount of storage overhead.
  The seminal work of Dimakis~\emph{et al.} first established a lower bound on the repair bandwidth for a single failed node of MDS codes, known as the \emph{cut-set bound}. MDS codes that achieve this bound are called minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes. Numerous constructions and theoretical analyses of MSR codes reveal that they typically require exponentially large sub-packetization levels, leading to significant disk I/O overhead. To mitigate this issue, many studies explore the trade-offs between the sub-packetization level and repair bandwidth, achieving reduced sub-packetization at the cost of suboptimal repair bandwidth. Despite these advances, the fundamental question of determining the minimum repair bandwidth for a single failure of MDS codes with fixed sub-packetization remains open.
  In this paper, we address this challenge for the case of two parity nodes ($n-k=2$) and sub-packetization $\ell=2$. We derive tight lower bounds on both the minimum repair bandwidth and the minimum I/O overhead. Furthermore, we present two explicit MDS array code constructions that achieve these bounds, respectively, offering practical code designs with provable repair efficiency.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Computation Offloading for Edge Inference: An Integrated Bayesian Optimization and Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge intelligence (EI) allows resource-constrained edge devices (EDs) to offload computation-intensive AI tasks (e.g., visual object detection) to edge servers (ESs) for fast execution. However, transmitting high-volume raw task data (e.g., 4K video) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks incurs significant latency. While EDs can reduce transmission latency by degrading data before transmission (e.g., reducing resolution from 4K to 720p or 480p), it often deteriorates inference accuracy, creating a critical accuracy-latency tradeoff. The difficulty in balancing this tradeoff stems from the absence of closed-form models capturing content-dependent accuracy-latency relationships. Besides, under bandwidth sharing constraints, the discrete degradation decisions among the EDs demonstrate inherent combinatorial complexity. Mathematically, it requires solving a challenging \textit{black-box} mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To address this problem, we propose LAB, a novel learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, LAB employs: (a) a DNN-based actor that maps input system state to degradation actions, directly addressing the combinatorial complexity of the MINLP; and (b) a BO-based critic with an explicit model built from fitting a Gaussian process surrogate with historical observations, enabling model-based evaluation of degradation actions. For each selected action, optimal bandwidth allocation is then efficiently derived via convex optimization. Numerical evaluations on real-world self-driving datasets demonstrate that LAB achieves near-optimal accuracy-latency tradeoff, exhibiting only 1.22\% accuracy degradation and 0.07s added latency compared to exhaustive search...</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled ISAC Systems with Fluid Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. However, conventional fixed antenna arrays limit the ability of UAVs to fully exploit their inherent potential. To overcome this limitation, we propose a UAV-enabled ISAC framework equipped with fluid antenna (FA) arrays, where the mobility of antenna elements introduces additional spatial degrees of freedom to simultaneously enhance communication and sensing performance. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the communication rates of multiple users while minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for single-target angle estimation. Due to excessively frequent updates of FA positions may lead to response delays, a three-timescale optimization framework is developed to jointly design transmit beamforming, FA positions, and UAV trajectory based on their characteristics. To solve the non-convexity of the problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, validating the effectiveness of integrating the FA technology into the UAV-enabled ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</description>

      <title>Path-Controlled Secure Network Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicast for securely sharing confidential data among many users is becoming increasingly important. Currently, it relies on duplicate-and-forward routing and cryptographic methods based on computational security. However, these approaches neither attain multicast capacity of the network, nor ensure long-term security against advances in computing (information-theoretic security: ITS). Existing ITS solutions--quantum key distribution (QKD), physical layer security (PLS), and secure network coding (SNC)--still fail to enable scalable networks, as their underlying assumptions, such as trusted nodes and wiretap thresholds, gradually become invalid as the network grows. Here, we develop an efficient multi-tree multicast path-finding method to address this issue, integrating it with universal strongly ramp SNC. This system, path-controlled universal strongly ramp SNC (PUSNEC), can be overlaid onto QKD/PLS networks, enabling multicast capacity, ITS, and scalability. We derive the maximum leakage information to an eavesdropper under the probabilistic wiretap network assumption and demonstrate secure multicast in multi-hop networks through numerical simulations. Our quantitative analysis of the secrecyreliability tradeoff highlights a practical approach to achieving secure, reliable multicast on a global scale.</description>

      <title>A Converse For the Capacity of the Shotgun Sequencing Channel with Erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shotgun sequencing process involves fragmenting a long DNA sequence (input string) into numerous shorter, unordered, and overlapping segments (referred to as \emph{reads}). The reads are sequenced, and later aligned to reconstruct the original string. Viewing the sequencing process as the read-phase of a DNA storage system, the information-theoretic capacity of noise-free shotgun sequencing has been characterized in literature. Motivated by the base-wise quality scores available in practical sequencers, a recent work considered the \emph{shotgun sequencing channel with erasures}, in which the symbols in the reads are assumed to contain random erasures. Achievable rates for this channel were identified. In the present work, we obtain a converse for this channel. The arguments for the proof involve a careful analysis of a genie-aided decoder, which knows the correct locations of the reads. The converse is not tight in general. However, it meets the achievability result asymptotically in some channel parameters.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Noncoherent Massive Random Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the capacity of massive random-access cellular networks, modeled as a MIMO fading channel with an infinite number of interfering cells. To characterize the symmetric sum rate of the network, a random-coding argument is invoked together with the assumption that in all cells users draw their codebooks according to the same distribution. This can be viewed as a generalization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in the literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the transmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading coefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed that the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model, rigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds depends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering cells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the interferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay exponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit power. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited networks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews ("Fundamental limits of cooperation", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Sept. 2013) -- cannot be avoided by random user activity or by using channel inputs beyond the scale family. In contrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially, then the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded capacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since the condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents interference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple access. We obtain this result by using bursty signaling together with treating interference as noise.</description>

      <title>Computational Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our capacity to process information depends on the computational power at our disposal. Information theory captures our ability to distinguish states or communicate messages when it is unconstrained with unrivaled elegance. For computationally bounded observers the situation is quite different. They can, for example, be fooled to believe that distributions are more random than they actually are. In our work, we go beyond the prevailing single-shot approach and take a new direction in computational quantum information theory that captures the essence of complexity-constrained information theory while retaining the look and feel of the unbounded asymptotic theory. As our foundational quantity, we define the computational relative entropy as the optimal error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing when restricted to polynomially many copies and quantum gates, defined in a mathematically rigorous way. Building on this foundation, we prove a computational analogue of Stein's lemma, establish computational versions of fundamental inequalities like Pinsker's bound, and demonstrate a computational smoothing property showing that computationally indistinguishable states yield equivalent information measures. We derive a computational entropy that operationally characterizes optimal compression rates for quantum states under computational limitations and show that our quantities apply to computational entanglement theory, proving a computational version of the Rains bound. Our framework reveals striking separations between computational and unbounded information measures, including quantum-classical gaps that arise from cryptographic assumptions, demonstrating that computational constraints fundamentally alter the information-theoretic landscape and open new research directions at the intersection of quantum information, complexity theory, and cryptography.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction beyond $SU(2)$ spin, bosonic, and permutation-invariant codes from convex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes and logical gates for three types of spaces -- composite permutation-invariant spaces of many qubits or qudits, composite constant-excitation Fock-state spaces of many bosonic modes, and monolithic nuclear state spaces of atoms, ions, and molecules. By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces. We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\ell_1$ codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with the code length $N$ by constructing $\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance larger than the known constructions.</description>

Abstract: We interpret the symmetrized weight enumerator of linear codes over finite commutative Frobenius rings as a summation over multisets and thereby provide a new proof of the MacWilliams identity for the symmetrized weight enumerator. The proof and the identity are expressed in combinatorial terms that do not require generating characters. We also generalize the symmetrized weight enumerator with respect to supports and codeword tuples, and our multiset approach enables us to derive new and general MacWilliams identities expressed in combinatorial terms.</description>

      <title>A Generalized $\chi_n$-Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mapping $\chi_n$ from $\F_{2}^{n}$ to itself defined by $y=\chi_n(x)$ with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+2}(1+x_{i+1})$, where the indices are computed modulo $n$, has been widely studied for its applications in lightweight cryptography. However, $\chi_n $ is bijective on $\F_2^n$ only when $n$ is odd, restricting its use to odd-dimensional vector spaces over $\F_2$. To address this limitation, we introduce and analyze the generalized mapping $\chi_{n, m}$ defined by $y=\chi_{n,m}(x)$ with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+m} (x_{i+m-1}+1)(x_{i+m-2}+1) \cdots (x_{i+1}+1)$, where $m$ is a fixed integer with $m\nmid n$. To investigate such mappings, we further generalize $\chi_{n,m}$ to $\theta_{m, k}$, where $\theta_{m, k}$ is given by $y_i=x_{i+mk} \prod_{\substack{j=1,\,\, m \nmid j}}^{mk-1} \left(x_{i+j}+1\right), \,\,{\rm for }\,\, i\in \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$. We prove that these mappings generate an abelian group isomorphic to the group of units in $\F_2[z]/(z^{\lfloor n/m\rfloor +1})$. This structural insight enables us to construct a broad class of permutations over $\F_2^n$ for any positive integer $n$, along with their inverses. We rigorously analyze algebraic properties of these mappings, including their iterations, fixed points, and cycle structures. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive database of the cryptographic properties for iterates of $\chi_{n,m}$ for small values of $n$ and $m$. Finally, we conduct a comparative security and implementation cost analysis among $\chi_{n,m}$, $\chi_n$, $\chi\chi_n$ (EUROCRYPT 2025 \cite{belkheyar2025chi}) and their variants, and prove Conjecture~1 proposed in~\cite{belkheyar2025chi} as a by-product of our study. Our results lead to generalizations of $\chi_n$, providing alternatives to $\chi_n$ and $\chi\chi_n$.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Root-Finding Algorithm and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Root-finding method is an iterative process that constructs a sequence converging to a solution of an equation. Householder's method is a higher-order method that requires higher order derivatives of the reciprocal of a function and has disadvantages. Firstly, symbolic computations can take a long time, and numerical methods to differentiate a function can accumulate errors. Secondly, the convergence factor existing in the literature is a rough estimate. In this paper, we propose a higher-order root-finding method using only Taylor expansion of a function. It has lower computational complexity with explicit convergence factor, and can be used to numerically implement Householder's method. As an application, we apply the proposed method to compute pre-images of $q$-ary entropy functions, commonly seen in coding theory. Finally, we study basins of attraction using the proposed method and compare them with other root-finding methods.</description>

      <title>Neural Integrated Sensing and Communication for the MIMO-OFDM Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ongoing convergence of spectrum and hardware requirements for wireless sensing and communication applications has fueled the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm in next-generation networks. Neural-network-based ISAC leverages data-driven learning techniques to add sensing capabilities to existing communication infrastructure. This paper presents a novel signal-processing framework for such neural ISAC systems based on the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) downlink. Our approach enables generalized sensing functionality without modifying the MIMO-OFDM communication link. Specifically, our neural ISAC pipeline measures the backscattered communication signals to generate discrete map representations of spatial occupancy, formulated as multiclass or multilabel classification problems, which can then be utilized by specialized downstream tasks. To improve sensing performance in closed or cluttered environments, our neural ISAC pipeline relies on features specifically designed to mitigate strong reflective paths. Extensive simulations using ray-tracing models demonstrate that our neural ISAC framework reliably reconstructs scene maps without altering the MIMO-OFDM communication pipeline or reducing data rates.</description>

      <title>Exponent Function for Stationary Memoryless Channels with Input Cost at Rates above the Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.06545v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stationaly memoryless channels with input cost. We prove that for transmission rates above the capacity the correct probability of decoding tends to zero exponentially as the block length $n$ of codes tends to infinity. In the case where both of channel input and output sets are finite, we determine the optimal exponent function on the above exponential decay of the correct probability. To derive this result we use a new technique called the recuresive method, which is based on the information spectrum approach. The recursive method utilize a certain recursive structure on the information spectrum quantities.</description>

      <title>On Single Server Private Information Retrieval with Private Coded Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by an open problem and a conjecture, this work studies the problem of single server private information retrieval with private coded side information (PIR-PCSI) that was recently introduced by Heidarzadeh et al. The goal of PIR-PCSI is to allow a user to efficiently retrieve a desired message $\bm{W}_{\bm{\theta}}$, which is one of $K$ independent messages that are stored at a server, while utilizing private side information of a linear combination of a uniformly chosen size-$M$ subset ($\bm{\mathcal{S}}\subset[K]$) of messages. The settings PIR-PCSI-I and PIR-PCSI-II correspond to the constraints that $\bm{\theta}$ is generated uniformly from $[K]\setminus\bm{\mathcal{S}}$, and $\bm{\mathcal{S}}$, respectively. In each case, $(\bm{\theta},\bm{\mathcal{S}})$ must be kept private from the server. The capacity is defined as the supremum over message and field sizes, of achievable rates (number of bits of desired message retrieved per bit of download) and is characterized by Heidarzadeh et al. for PIR-PCSI-I in general, and for PIR-PCSI-II for $M&gt;(K+1)/2$ as $(K-M+1)^{-1}$. For $2\leq M\leq (K+1)/2$ the capacity of PIR-PCSI-II remains open, and it is conjectured that even in this case the capacity is $(K-M+1)^{-1}$. We show the capacity of PIR-PCSI-II is equal to $2/K$ for $2 \leq M \leq \frac{K+1}{2}$, which is strictly larger than the conjectured value, and does not depend on $M$ within this parameter regime. Remarkably, half the side-information is found to be redundant. We also characterize the infimum capacity (infimum over fields instead of supremum), and the capacity with private coefficients. The results are generalized to PIR-PCSI-I ($\theta\in[K]\setminus\mathcal{S}$) and PIR-PCSI ($\theta\in[K]$) settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cross Subspace Alignment Codes via the $N$-sum Box Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-subspace alignment (CSA) codes are used in various private information retrieval (PIR) schemes (e.g., with secure storage) and in secure distributed batch matrix multiplication (SDBMM). Using a recently developed $N$-sum box abstraction of a quantum multiple-access channel (QMAC), we translate CSA schemes over classical multiple-access channels into efficient quantum CSA schemes over a QMAC, achieving maximal superdense coding gain. Because of the $N$-sum box abstraction, the underlying problem of coding to exploit quantum entanglements for CSA schemes, becomes conceptually equivalent to that of designing a channel matrix for a MIMO MAC subject to given structural constraints imposed by the $N$-sum box abstraction, such that the resulting MIMO MAC is able to implement the functionality of a CSA scheme (encoding/decoding) \emph{over-the-air}. Applications include Quantum PIR with secure and MDS-coded storage, as well as Quantum SDBMM.</description>

      <title>Quantum $X$-Secure $T$-Private Information Retrieval From MDS Coded Storage With Unresponsive and Byzantine Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A communication-efficient protocol is introduced over a many-to-one quantum network for Q-E-B-MDS-X-TPIR, i.e., quantum private information retrieval with MDS-$X$-secure storage and $T$-private queries. The protocol is resilient to any set of up to $E$ unresponsive servers (erased servers or stragglers) and any set of up to $B$ Byzantine servers. The underlying coding scheme incorporates an enhanced version of a Cross Subspace Alignment (CSA) code, namely a Modified CSA (MCSA) code, into the framework of CSS codes. The error-correcting capabilities of CSS codes are leveraged to encode the dimensions that carry desired computation results from the MCSA code into the error space of the CSS code, while the undesired interference terms are aligned into the stabilized code space. The challenge is to do this efficiently while also correcting quantum erasures and Byzantine errors. The protocol achieves superdense coding gain over comparable classical baselines for Q-E-B-MDS-X-TPIR, recovers as special cases the state of art results for various other quantum PIR settings previously studied in the literature, and paves the way for applications in quantum coded distributed computation, where CSA code structures are important for communication efficiency, while security and resilience to stragglers and Byzantine servers are critical.</description>

      <title>Blind Interference Alignment for MapReduce: Exploiting Side-information with Reconfigurable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to explore how blind interference alignment (BIA) schemes may take advantage of side-information in computation tasks, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a $K$ user wireless network setting that arises in full-duplex wireless MapReduce applications. In this setting the receivers are assumed to have reconfigurable antennas and channel knowledge, while the transmitters have neither, i.e., the transmitters lack channel knowledge and are only equipped with conventional antennas. The central ingredient of the problem formulation is the message structure arising out of the Shuffle phase of MapReduce, whereby each transmitter has a subset of messages that need to be delivered to various receivers, and each receiver has a subset of messages available to it in advance as side-information. We approach this problem by decomposing it into distinctive stages that help identify key ingredients of the overall solution. The novel elements that emerge from the first stage, called broadcast with groupcast messages, include an outer maximum distance separable (MDS) code structure at the transmitter, and an algorithm for iteratively determining groupcast-optimal reconfigurable antenna switching patterns at the receiver to achieve intra-message (among the symbols of the same message) alignment. The next stage, called unicast with side-information, reveals optimal inter-message (among symbols of different messages) alignment patterns to exploit side-information, and by a relabeling of messages, connects to the desired MapReduce setting.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) is a disruptive tech-nology for future wireless communication networks. This paper considers the joint optimization of beamforming matrices and antenna positions for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization in fluid antenna (FA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks, which presents significant chal-lenges due to the strong coupling between beamforming and FA positions, the non-concavity of the WSR objective function, and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based method that employs matrix fractional programming techniques to reformulate the original complex problem into a more tractable form. Then, we develop a parallel majorization maximization (MM) algorithm capable of optimizing all FA positions simul-taneously. To further reduce computational costs, we propose a decentralized implementation based on the decentralized base-band processing (DBP) architecture. Simulation results demon-strate that our proposed algorithm not only achieves significant WSR improvements over conventional MIMO networks but also outperforms the existing method. Moreover, the decentralized implementation substantially reduces computation time while maintaining similar performance compared with the centralized implementation.</description>

      <title>Low-complexity Detection for Noncoherent Massive MIMO Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies a point-to-point MIMO uplink in which user equipment transmits data to a base station equipped with a massive array. Signal detection is noncoherent and fading is assumed to follow the Weichselberger model. By exploiting the spatial stationarity of fading at the base station, a cyclostationary structure emerges naturally in the space-time representation, which suggests formulating the statistical properties of the received signal in the Karhunen-Lo\`eve domain. This allows the derivation of a low-complexity receiver that approximates maximum likelihood detection even for a moderate array size. The spectral analysis of the problem provides valuable insights on the design of space-time codewords.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The group testing problem consists of determining a sparse subset of defective items from within a larger set of items via a series of tests, where each test outcome indicates whether at least one defective item is included in the test. We study the approximate recovery setting, where the recovery criterion of the defective set is relaxed to allow a small number of items to be misclassified. In particular, we consider one-sided approximate recovery criteria, where we allow either only false negative or only false positive misclassifications. Under false negatives only (i.e., finding a subset of defectives), we show that there exists an algorithm matching the optimal threshold of two-sided approximate recovery. Under false positives only (i.e., finding a superset of the defectives), we provide a converse bound showing that the better of two existing algorithms is optimal.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Systems Meet Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Fundamentals, Opportunities, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are widely regarded as a cornerstone of the emerging low-altitude economy, yet they face significant challenges, including rapidly varying channels, diverse functional requirements, and dynamic interference environments. Fluid antenna (FA) systems introduce spatial reconfigurability that complements and extends conventional beamforming, enabling flexible exploitation of spatial diversity and adaptive response to channel variations. This paper proposes a novel architecture for FA-empowered LAWNs and presents a case study demonstrating substantial improvements in communication, sensing, and control performance compared to fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Key practical deployment considerations are examined, including mechanical design, position control, energy efficiency, and compliance with emerging industry standards. In addition, several future research directions are highlighted, including intelligent optimization, multi-function integration, and the exploration of novel low-altitude applications. By integrating theoretical analysis with practical deployment perspectives, this paper establishes FA systems as a key enabler for adaptive, efficient, and resilient network infrastructures in next-generation LAWNs.</description>

      <title>Version Age of Information with Contact Mobility in Gossip Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric, defined as the difference between the version of information available at a given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average version age in the network.</description>

      <title>Learning to Bid Optimally and Efficiently in Adversarial First-price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.04568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-price auctions have very recently swept the online advertising industry, replacing second-price auctions as the predominant auction mechanism on many platforms. This shift has brought forth important challenges for a bidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in second-price auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value truthfully and hard to know the others' bidding behaviors? In this paper, we take an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem of learning to bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private valuations and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first minimax optimal online bidding algorithm that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz bidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding strategies. This novel algorithm is built on the insight that the presence of a good expert can be leveraged to improve performance, as well as an original hierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent interest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that exists in the problem, we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form statistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to a computationally efficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally, through an impossibility result, we highlight that one is unlikely to compete this favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz bidding policies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price auction datasets obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to several existing bidding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to MCMC acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As concrete algorithmic applications in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we provide two illustrations based on lifted MCMC and swapping algorithm respectively to demonstrate projection samplers improve mixing over the original samplers. The projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step, and we prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm. Through simple numerical experiments on a bimodal target distribution, we show that the projection samplers mix effectively, in contrast to lifted MCMC and the swapping algorithm, which mix less well.</description>

Abstract: Arranging the bits of a random string or real into k columns of a two-dimensional array or higher dimensional structure is typically accompanied with loss in the Kolmogorov complexity of the columns, which depends on k. We quantify and characterize this phenomenon for arrays and trees and its relationship to negligible classes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Summary Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.</description>

      <title>Interactive Inference: A Neuromorphic Theory of Human-Computer Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05935v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a theoretical approach to designing better user experiences (UX) motivated by advances in the understanding of the neurophysiology of the brain. Inspired by the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference, Interactive Inference is a first example of such approach. It offers a simplified interpretation of Active Inference that allows designers to more readily apply this theory to design and evaluation. In Interactive Inference, user behaviour is modeled as Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions that predicts the next action. We show how the error between goal and progress distributions, or Bayesian surprise, can be modeled as a simple mean square error of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a task. The problem is that the user's capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of this SNR. This means errors rise quickly once average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error using one framework that can provide real-time estimates of the mental load in users that needs to be minimized by design. We show how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law can be expressed using our model. We then test the validity of the model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance and error in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can be useful as a new theoretical design tool.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the dynamic structural resilience of international staple food trade networks: An entropy-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing a resilient food trade system is an international consensus on safeguarding food security amid growing disruptions. However, a unified resilience framework has yet to be established, leading to the proliferation of diverse measures. Here, we conceptualize resilience as a trade-off between efficiency and redundancy and employ an entropy-based approach to quantify the dynamic structural resilience of international trade networks for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat from 1986 to 2022. Using index decomposition analysis, we also investigate the relative contributions of internal components to resilience dynamics. Within this framework, despite heterogeneity across different food commodities, we find that current trade networks are relatively redundant, with improvements in efficiency being the dominant driver of changes in resilience. In addition, we reveal a historically pronounced impact of flow concentrations on resilience, while trade interactions have become increasingly important in recent years. Following the leave-one-out approach, we furthermore identify critical economies and trade relationships that disproportionately affect the overall resilience, some of which are less well-focused in previous studies. Moreover, we highlight that overconcentration of flows along core trade relationships may undermine both efficiency and resilience, whereas peripheral trade networks may play strategic alternative roles in sustaining resilience, underscoring the importance of concentrating on developing economies and promoting broader trade links. These findings not only provide new insights for assessing the resilience of international food trade systems but also propose directions for strengthening resilience through both regional cooperation and more inclusive trade relations.</description>

      <title>ML-PWS: Estimating the Mutual Information Between Experimental Time Series Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.</description>
