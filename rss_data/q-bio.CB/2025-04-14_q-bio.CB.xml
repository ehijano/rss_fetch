      <title>Information bounds on the accuracy of cell polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we characterized an information measure for cell polarity that applies to non-motile cells responding to a chemical gradient. The central idea is that polarization represents information about the direction of the gradient. We applied a theory of optimal gradient sensing and response in the presence of external noise based on the information capacity of a Gaussian channel. First, we formulated an information framework that describes spatial gradient sensing and polarization response. As part of this section, we modeled ligand diffusion and receptor-binding dynamics as a mixed Poisson distribution, confirming the single receptor accuracy limits derived by ten Wolde and colleagues. Second, we performed numerical calculations of stochastic ligand levels at the cell surface to estimate the information provided about the directional component of the gradient vector, which was close to the Gaussian channel bound for low signal-to-noise ratios. Third, we used the information framework to evaluate the noise-robustness of three generic models of cell polarity, demonstrating that a filter-amplifier architecture and time integration can attenuate the detrimental impact of noise on polarity so that the model can approach the theoretical limits. Fourth, we compared the theory to published experimental data on yeast mating projection growth in a pheromone gradient, identifying the ligand association rate and integration time as two key parameters affecting directional accuracy. By varying these parameters, we showed that for certain ranges the theory is roughly in agreement with the data, and that the slow binding rate constant is a key limiting factor. We concluded that temporal averaging can help overcome the slow binding rate to achieve greater accuracy, but with the drawback of a slow mating response.</description>

      <title>Towards generalizable single-cell perturbation modeling via the Conditional Monge Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the response of single-cells to various treatments offers great potential to enable targeted therapies. In this context, neural optimal transport (OT) has emerged as a principled methodological framework because it inherently accommodates the challenges of unpaired data induced by cell destruction during data acquisition. However, most existing OT approaches are incapable of conditioning on different treatment contexts (e.g., time, drug treatment, drug dosage, or cell type) and we still lack methods that unanimously show promising generalization performance to unseen treatments. Here, we propose the Conditional Monge Gap which learns OT maps conditionally on arbitrary covariates. We demonstrate its value in predicting single-cell perturbation responses conditional to one or multiple drugs, a drug dosage, or combinations thereof. We find that our conditional models achieve results comparable and sometimes even superior to the condition-specific state-of-the-art on scRNA-seq as well as multiplexed protein imaging data. Notably, by aggregating data across conditions we perform cross-task learning which unlocks remarkable generalization abilities to unseen drugs or drug dosages, widely outperforming other conditional models in capturing heterogeneity (i.e., higher moments) in the perturbed population. Finally, by scaling to hundreds of conditions and testing on unseen drugs, we narrow the gap between structure-based and effect-based drug representations, suggesting a promising path to the successful prediction of perturbation effects for unseen treatments.</description>
