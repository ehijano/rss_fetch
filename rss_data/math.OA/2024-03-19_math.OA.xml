      <title>On the (Local) Lifting Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (Local) Lifting Property ((L)LP) is introduced by Kirchberg and deals with lifting completely positive maps. We give a characterization of the (L)LP in terms of lifting $\ast$-homomorphisms. We use it to prove that if $A$ and $B$ have the LP and $F$ is their finite-dimensional C*-subalgebra, then $A\ast_F B$ has the LP. This answers a question of Ozawa.
  We prove that Exel's soft tori have the LP. As a consequence we obtain that $C^*(F_n\times F_n)$ is inductive limit of RFD C*-algebras with the LP.
  We prove that for a class of C*-algebras including $C^*(F_n\times F_n)$ and all contractible C*-algebras, the LLP is equivalent to Ext being a group.
  As byproduct of methods developed in the paper we generalize Kirchebrg's theorem about extensions with the WEP, give short proofs of several, old and new, facts about soft tori, new unified proofs of Li and Shen characterization of RFD property of free products amalgamated over a finite-dimensional subalgebra and Blackadar's characterization of semiprojectivity of them, and we show that the class of C*-algebras with the LP is closed under cross products with amenable groups.</description>

      <title>A geometric characterisation of real C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the positive cone of a real C*-algebra geometrically. Given an open cone $\Omega$ in a real Banach space $V$, with closure $\overline \Omega$, we show that $\Omega$ is the interior of the positive cone of a unital real C*-algebra if and only if it is a Finsler symmetric cone with an orientable extension, which is equivalent to the condition that $V$ is, in an equivalent norm, the hermitian part of a unital real C*-algebra with positive cone $\overline\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Weak exactness and amalgamated free product of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the amalgamated free product of weakly exact von Neumann algebras is weakly exact. This is done by using a universal property of Toeplitz-Pimsner algebras and a locally convex topology on bimodules of von Neumann algebras, which is used to characterize weakly exact von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>$K_{0}$-groups and strongly irreducible decompositions of operator tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An operator tuple $\mathbf{T}=(T_{1},\ldots,T_{n})$ is called strongly irreducible (SI), if the joint commutant of $\mathbf{T}$ does not any nontrivial idempotent operator. In this paper, we study the uniqueness of finitely strong irreducible decomposition of operator tuples up to similarity by $K$-theory of operator algebra, and give the algebraically similarity invariants of the Cowen-Douglas tuple with index 1 by using $K_{0}$-group of the commutant of operator tuples. As an application, we calculate $K_{0}$-groups of some multiplier algebras, and describe the similarity of backwards multishifts on Drury-Arveson space by means of inflation theory.</description>

      <title>RFD property for groupoid C*-algebras of amenable groupoids and for crossed products by amenable actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By Bekka's theorem the group C*-algebra of an amenable group $G$ is residually finite dimensional (RFD) if and only if $G$ is maximally almost periodic (MAP). We generalize this result in two directions of dynamical flavour. Firstly, we provide a sufficient condition for the RFD property of the C*-algebra of an amenable \'etale groupoid. Secondly, we characterize RFD property for crossed products by amenable actions of discrete groups on C*-algebras. The characterisation can be formulated in various terms, such as primitive ideals, (pure) states and approximations of representations, and can be viewed as a dynamical version of Exel-Loring characterization of RFD C*-algebras. As byproduct of our methods we also characterize the property FD of Lubotzky and Shalom for semidirect products by amenable groups and obtain characterizations of the properties MAP and RF for general semidirect products of groups. The latter descriptions allow us to obtain the properties MAP, RF, RFD and FD for various examples.</description>

      <title>An index for quantum cellular automata on fusion spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting the GNVW index for 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA) in terms of the Jones index for subfactors leads to a generalization of the index defined for QCA on more general abstract spin chains. These include fusion spin chains, which arise as the local operators invariant under a global (categorical/MPO) symmetry, and as the boundary operators of 2D topological codes. We show that for the fusion spin chains built from the fusion category $\mathbf{Fib}$, the index is a complete invariant for the group of QCA modulo finite depth circuits.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Spectral Flow for Families of Dirac-type Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting of a proper, cocompact action by a locally compact, unimodular group $G$ on a Riemannian manifold, we construct equivariant spectral flow of paths of Dirac-type operators. This takes values in the $K$-theory of the group $C^*$-algebra of $G$. In the case where $G$ is the fundamental group of a compact manifold, the summation map maps equivariant spectral flow on the universal cover to classical spectral flow on the base manifold. We obtain "index equals spectral flow" results. In the setting of a smooth path of $G$-invariant Riemannian metrics on a $G$-spin manifold, we show that the equivariant spectral flow of the corresponding path of spin Dirac operators relates delocalised $\eta$-invariants and $\rho$-invariants for different positive scalar curvature metrics to each other.</description>
