      <title>Polynomial functors in {\pi}-clans for the semantics of type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The category of contexts underlying a model of Martin-L\"of type theory with Unit-, $\Sigma$-, and $\Pi$-types need not be locally Cartesian closed, but is necessarily a $\pi$-clan. We exploit this $\pi$-clan structure to build the theory of polynomial functors. This paper presents two equivalent notions of strict semantics for MLTT in this weaker setting, respectively "elementary models" - reformulating categories with families - and "algebraic models" - reformulating natural models. These components fit into a practical sequence of steps for constructing models of MLTT: building an elementary model, extracting a $\pi$-clan from the elementary model, and then using polynomial functors built on the $\pi$-clan structure to convert the elementary model into an algebraic one.</description>

      <title>Categories graded by group homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise to a group homomorphism $\tau$ the $\chi$-graded categories of S\"{o}zer and Virelizier. These are categories in which both morphisms and objects have compatible degrees. We give a 'half-enriched' Yoneda lemma, a structure theorem for semisimple $\tau$-graded categories, and an alternative picture of $\tau$-graded categories in terms of pseudofunctors into $\mathbf{Cat}$.</description>

      <title>Duality in Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare closed and rigid monoidal categories. Closedness is defined by the tensor product having a right adjoint: the internal hom functor. Rigidity, on the other hand, generalises the duality of finite-dimensional vector spaces. In the latter, the internal hom functor is implemented by tensoring with the respective duals. This raises the question: can one decide whether a closed monoidal category is rigid, simply by verifying that the internal hom is tensor-representable? We provide a counterexample in terms of the category of sl2-crystals. As a byproduct, we obtain characterisations of the Grothendieck-Verdier duality and rigidity of functor categories endowed with Day convolution as their tensor product. This has various applications, three of which we study in detail: generalisations of quasi-Frobenius algebras, called QF-2 algebras; Mackey functors, where we prove that, as expected due to work of Bouc, an object being rigidly dualisable is equivalent to it being finitely-generated projective; and crossed modules of finite groups, where we associate to each of these objects a Grothendieck-Verdier category of group-graded representations.</description>

      <title>Strongly finitary metric monads are too strong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Varieties of quantitative algebras are fully described by their free-algebra monads on the category Met of metric spaces. For a longer time it has been an open problem whether the resulting enriched monads are precisely the strongly finitary ones (determined by their values on finite discrete spaces). We present a counter-example: the variety of algebras on two close binary operations yields a monad which is not strongly finitary. A full characterization of free-algebra monads of varieties is: they are the 1-basic monads, i.e., weighted colimits of strongly finitary monads (in the category of enriched finitary monads). As a consequence, strongly finitary endofunctors on Met are not closed under composition.</description>

      <title>Emergent SUSY in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a renormalization group flow with emergent supersymmetry in two dimensions from a non-Lagrangian theory. The ultraviolet theory does not have supersymmetry while the infrared theory does. We constrain the flow both analytically and numerically (truncated conformal space approach). Analytic constraints include a new spin constraint.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Dress groups with non-symmetric cost functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A metric relation by definition is symmetric. Since many data sets are non-symmetric, in this paper we develop a systematic theory of non-symmetric cost functions. Betweenness relations play an important role. We also introduce the notion of a Dress group in the non-symmetric setting and indicate a notion of curvature.</description>
