      <title>Resource Limitations induce Phase Transitions in Biological Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological information processing manifests a huge variety in its complexity and capability among different organisms, which presumably stems from the evolutionary optimization under limited computational resources. Starting from the simplest memory-less responsive behaviors, more complicated information processing using internal memory may have developed in the evolution as more resources become available. In this letter, we report that optimal information processing strategy can show discontinuous transitions along with the available resources, i.e., reliability of sensing and intrinsic dynamics, or the cost of memory control. In addition, we show that transition is not always progressive but can be regressed. Our result obtained under a minimal setup suggests that the capability and complexity of information processing would be an evolvable trait that can switch back and forth between different strategies and architectures in a punctuated manner.</description>

      <title>Theory for Optimal Estimation and Control under Resource Limitations and Its Applications to Biological Information Processing and Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being optimized, the information processing of biological organisms exhibits significant variability in its complexity and capability. One potential source of this diversity is the limitation of resources required for information processing. However, we lack a theoretical framework that comprehends the relationship between biological information processing and resource limitations and integrates it with decision-making conduced downstream of the information processing. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal estimation and control theory that accounts for the resource limitations inherent in biological systems. This theory explicitly formulates the memory that organisms can store and operate and obtains optimal memory dynamics using optimal control theory. This approach takes account of various resource limitations, such as memory capacity, intrinsic noise, and energy cost, and unifies state estimation and control. We apply this theory to minimal models of biological information processing and decision-making under resource limitations and find that such limitations induce discontinuous and non-monotonic phase transitions between memory-less and memory-based strategies. Therefore, this theory establishes a comprehensive framework for addressing biological information processing and decision-making under resource limitations, revealing the rich and complex behaviors that arise from resource limitations.</description>

      <title>Formation and temperature stability of the liquid phase in thin-film systems: monograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monograph summarizes the studies of the temperature limits for the existence of a supercooled liquid phase of the components of nanodisperse structures. Original in situ methods for studying supercooling during crystallization in nanodispersed systems are proposed. The results of long-term studies of the features of crystallization of particles on different substrates, or as part of layered film systems are presented. The influence of the interaction at the melt-substrate (matrix) interface, as well as the conditions of preparation of the samples on the values of the limiting supercooling are determined.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in chromatin: mesoscopic and mean-field approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of a minimal physical model, we investigate the interplay of two phase transitions at play in chromatin organization: (1) liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within the fluid solvating chromatin, resulting in the formation of biocondensates, and (2) the coil-globule crossover of the chromatin fiber, which drives the condensation or extension of the chain. In our model, a species representing a domain of chromatin is embedded in a binary fluid. This fluid phase separates to form a droplet rich in a macromolecule (B). Chromatin particles are trapped in a harmonic potential to reproduce the coil and globular phases of an isolated polymer chain. We investigate the role of the droplet material B on the radius of gyration of this polymer and find that this radius varies nonmonotonically with respect to the volume fraction of B. This behavior is reminiscent of a phenomenon known as $\textit{co-non-solvency}$: a polymer chain in good solvent (S) may collapse when a second good solvent (here B) is added in low quantity, and expand at higher B concentration. Additionally, the presence of finite-size effects on the coil-globule transition results in a qualitatively different impact of the droplet material on polymers of various sizes. In the context of genetic regulation, our results suggest that the size of chromatin domains and the quantity of condensate proteins are key parameters to control whether chromatin may respond to an increase of the quantity of chromatin-binding proteins by condensing or expanding.</description>

      <title>Membrane tubes with active pumping: water transport, vacuole formation and osmoregulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for organisms to regulate their volume and osmolarity when surrounded by freshwater is a basic physical challenge for many bacteria, protists and algae. Taking inspiration from the contractile vacuole complex found in many protists, we discuss how simple models of active membrane tubes can give insights into the fluid and active ionic transport properties of such systems. We show that a simple membrane tube with unidirectional ion pumps, and passive ion and water channels, forms a large vacuole due to osmotically-driven water flow and that this can be used to actively pump water out of the cell interior. We discuss the use of this system as a possible minimal method for osmoregulation.</description>

      <title>Viscotaxis of Beating Flagella at Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological microorganisms and artificial microswimmers react to external cues of environmental gradients by changing their swimming directions. We study here the behavior of eukarytic flagellated microswimmers in linear viscosity gradients. We employ a model of flagellum consisting of a semi-flexible filament with a travelling wave of spontaneous curvature to study viscotaxis of actively beating flagella in two spatial dimensions. The propulsion of the flagellum in a fluid due to a hydrodynamic friction anisotropy is described by resistive-force theory. Using numerical simulations and analytical theory, we show that beating flagella exhibit positive viscotaxis, reorienting themselves toward higher viscosity areas. We quantify this behavior by characterization of the dependence of the rotational velocity on beat amplitude, swimming speed, and wave length. We also examining the effects of asymmetric flagellar wave forms, which imply circular trajectories in the absence of viscosity gradients; here, large asymmetry leads to trochoid-like trajectories perpendicular to the gradient in the form drifting circles. The flagellar deformability strongly reduce the beat amplitude and the viscotatic response. The viscotatic response is shown to be captured by a universal function of the sperm number.</description>

      <title>bioSBM: a random graph model to integrate epigenomic data in chromatin structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial organization of chromatin within the nucleus plays a crucial role in gene expression and genome function. However, the quantitative relationship between this organization and nuclear biochemical processes remains under debate. In this study, we present a graph-based generative model, bioSBM, designed to capture long-range chromatin interaction patterns from Hi-C data and, importantly, simultaneously, link these patterns to biochemical features. Applying bioSBM to Hi-C maps of the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line, we identified a latent structure of chromatin interactions, revealing 12 distinct communities that strongly align with known biological annotations. Additionally, we infer a linear transformation that maps biochemical observables, such as histone marks, to the parameters of the generative graph model, enabling accurate genome-wide predictions of chromatin contact maps on out-of-sample data, both within the same cell line, and on the completely unseen HCT116 cell line under RAD21 depletion. These findings highlight bioSBM's potential as a powerful tool for elucidating the relationship between biochemistry and chromatin architecture and predicting long-range genome organization from independent biochemical data.</description>

      <title>Bird-inspired tendon coupling improves paddling efficiency by shortening phase transition times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drag-based swimming with rowing appendages, fins, and webbed feet is a widely adapted locomotion form in aquatic animals. To develop effective underwater and swimming vehicles, a wide range of bioinspired drag-based paddles have been proposed, often faced with a trade-off between propulsive efficiency and versatility. Webbed feet provide an effective propulsive force in the power phase, are light weight and robust, and can even be partially folded away in the recovery phase. However, during the transition between recovery and power phase, much time is lost folding and unfolding, leading to drag and reducing efficiency. In this work, we took inspiration from the coupling tendons of aquatic birds and utilized tendon coupling mechanisms to shorten the transition time between recovery and power phase. Results from our hardware experiments show that the proposed mechanisms improve propulsive efficiency by 2.0 and 2.4 times compared to a design without extensor tendons or based on passive paddle, respectively. We further report that distal leg joint clutching, which has been shown to improve efficiency in terrestrial walking, did not play an major role in swimming locomotion. In sum, we describe a new principle for an efficient, drag-based leg and paddle design, with potential relevance for the swimming mechanics in aquatic birds.</description>

      <title>Thermostatting of Active Hamiltonian Systems via Symplectic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of non-standard, two-dimensional (2D) Hamiltonian models that may show features of active particle dynamics, and therefore, we refer to these models as active Hamiltonian (AH) systems. The idea is to consider a spin fluid where -- on top of spin-spin and particle-particle interactions -- spins are coupled to the particle's velocities via a vector potential. Continuous spin variables interact with each other as in a standard $XY$ model. Typically, the AH models exhibit non-standard thermodynamic properties (e.g., for temperature and pressure) and equations of motion with non-standard forces. This implies that the derivation of symplectic algorithms to solve Hamilton's equations of motion numerically, as well as the thermostatting for these systems, is not straightforward. Here, we derive a symplectic integration scheme and propose a Nos\'e-Poincar\'e thermostat, providing a correct sampling in the canonical ensemble. The expressions for AH systems that we find for temperature and pressure might have parallels with the ongoing debate about the definition of pressure and the equation of state in active matter systems. For a specific AH model, recently proposed by Casiulis et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 124}, 198001 (2020)], we rationalize the symplectic algorithm and the proposed thermostatting, and investigate the transition from a fluid at high temperature to a cluster phase at low temperature where, due to the coupling of velocities and spins, the cluster phase shows a collective motion that is reminiscent to that observed in a variety of active systems.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are essential instruments in contemporary nuclear physics research. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo beta+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Extreme-value analysis in nano-biological systems: Applications and Implications</title>

Abstract: Extreme value analysis (EVA) is a statistical method that studies the properties of extreme values of datasets, crucial for fields like engineering, meteorology, finance, insurance, and environmental science. EVA models extreme events using distributions such as Fr\'echet, Weibull, or Gumbel, aiding in risk prediction and management. This review explores EVA's application to nanoscale biological systems. Traditionally, biological research focuses on average values from repeated experiments. However, EVA offers insights into molecular mechanisms by examining extreme data points. We introduce EVA's concepts with simulations and review its use in studying motor protein movements within cells, highlighting the importance of in vivo analysis due to the complex intracellular environment. We suggest EVA as a tool for extracting motor proteins' physical properties in vivo and discuss its potential in other biological systems. While there have been only a few applications of EVA to biological systems, it holds promise for uncovering hidden properties in extreme data, promoting its broader application in life sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can a filament transmit the curvatures across the constituting modules and control them at one of its end? Inspired by the observation of protofilament - constituent biopolymer of microtubule - this question is addressed by a constructive approach. In our model a simple allosteric element in each module couples with the neighboring modules at its interfaces, which gives rise to a single degree of freedom to control the global shape of the filament. The model can be analyzed in analogy with discrete-time dynamical systems having a bifurcation of trans-critical type.</description>
