      <title>The tautological ring of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ is rarely Gorenstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the tautological rings $\mathsf{R}^*(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ and $\mathsf{RH}^*(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ are not Gorenstein when $g\geq 2$ and $2g+n\geq 24$, extending results of Petersen and Tommasi in genus $2$. The proof uses the intersection of tautological classes with non-tautological bielliptic cycles. We conjecture the converse: the tautological rings should be Gorenstein when $g=0,1$ or $g\geq 2$ and $2g+n&lt;24$. The conjecture is known for $g=0,1$ by work of Keel and Petersen, and we prove several new cases of this conjecture for $\mathsf{RH}^*(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$ when $g\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Injectivity theorems and cubical descent for schemes, stacks, and analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove relative injectivity, torsion-freeness, and vanishing theorems for generalized normal crossing pairs on schemes, algebraic stacks, formal schemes, semianalytic germs of complex analytic spaces, rigid analytic spaces, Berkovich spaces, and adic spaces locally of weakly finite type over a field, all in equal characteristic zero. We give a uniform proof for all these theorems in all the categories of spaces mentioned above, which were previously only known for varieties and complex analytic spaces due to work of Ambro and Fujino. Ambro and Fujino's results are integral in the proofs of the fundamental theorems of the minimal model program for (semi-)log canonical pairs and the theory of quasi-log structures. Our results resolve a significant barrier to extending these results on (semi-)log canonical pairs and quasi-log structures beyond the setting of varieties and complex analytic spaces.
  In order to prove our most general injectivity theorems, we generalize to all these categories of spaces a criterion due to Guill\'en and Navarro Aznar characterizing when functors defined on smooth varieties extend to all varieties. This extension result uses cubical hyperresolutions, which we construct in all categories of spaces mentioned above. Our extension result is very general and is of independent interest. We use this extension result to prove our injectivity theorems for generalized normal crossing pairs. We also apply our extension result to develop the theoretical foundations for the Deligne-Du Bois complex in these categories of spaces and to construct a weight filtration on the (pro-)\'etale cohomology of schemes and rigid analytic spaces. These results establish some aspects of Deligne-Hodge theory in all categories of spaces mentioned above.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Torelli Problem through the geometry of the Gauss map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a non-hyperelliptic curve $C\in\mathscr{M}_g$ and $2\leq n\leq g-2$, we prove that the generic fiber of the Gauss map on $W_n$ has one element and we characterize its multiple locus. Assuming that $C$ doesn't have a $\mathfrak{g}_{n+k+1}^{k+1}$, for $1\leq k\leq n-1\leq g-3$, we solve the problem of reconstructing each $\mathfrak{g}_{n+k}^k$ and the dual hypersurface of the image of its associated morphism, through information encoded in the Gauss map. For this purpose we introduce the notion of $\left(n+k\right)$-intersection loci and we study their dimensions. In the hyperelliptic case we prove that the image of the Gauss map is a union of sets whose closures are birational to their complete $\mathfrak{g}_{n+k}^k$, for each $1\leq k\leq n\leq g-1$, and that these also contain a copy of the dual hypersurface of the image of its associated morphism. From the case $k=n$ we deduce that the closure of the image of the Gauss map is birational to $\mathbb{P}^n$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of periodic points for loxodromic automorphisms of affine surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two automorphisms of an affine surface with dynamical degree strictly larger than 1 share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they have the same periodic points. We construct canonical heights for these automorphisms and use arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties following the work of Yuan and Zhang. Finally, we extend the local arithmetic Hodge index theorem to a certain class of vertical adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties to conclude the proof.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behaviors of Moduli of One-dimensional Sheaves on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviors of the Betti numbers and Picard numbers of the moduli space $M_{\beta,\chi}$ of one-dimensional sheaves supported in a curve class $\beta$ on $S$ with Euler characteristic $\chi$. We determine the intersection cohomology Betti numbers of $M_{\beta,\chi}$ when $S$ is a del Pezzo surface and $\beta$ is sufficiently positive. As an application, we formulate a $P = C$ conjecture regarding the refined BPS invariants for local del Pezzo surfaces.</description>

      <title>Strongly A^1-invariant sheaves (after F. Morel)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly (respectively strictly) A1-invariant sheaves are foundational for motivic homotopy theory over fields. They are sheaves of (abelian) groups on the Nisnevich site of smooth varieties over a field k, with the property that their zeroth and first Nisnevich cohomology sets (respectively all Nisnevich cohomology groups) are invariant under replacing a variety X by the affine line over X. A celebrated theorem of Fabien Morel states that if the base field k is perfect, then any strongly A1-invariant sheaf of abelian groups is automatically strictly A1-invariant.
  The aim of these lecture notes is twofold: (1) provide a complete proof if this result, and (2) outline some of its applications.</description>

      <title>$ \mathbb{Z}_{2} $- homology of the orbit spaces $ G_{n,2}/ T^{n} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology groups of the orbit space $X_n = G_{n,2}/T^n$ for the canonical action of the compact torus $T^n$ on a complex Grassmann manifold $G_{n,2}$. Our starting point is the model $(U_n, p_n)$ for $X_n$ constructed by Buchstaber and Terzi\'c (2020), where $U_n = \Delta _{n,2}\times \mathcal{F}_{n}$ for a hypersimplex $\Delta_{n,2}$ and an universal space of parameters $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ defined in Buchstaber and Terzi\'c (2019), (2020). It is proved by Buchstaber and Terzi\'c (2021) that $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ is diffeomorphic to the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$ of stable $n$-pointed genus zero curves. We exploit the results from Keel (1992) and Ceyhan (2009) on homology groups of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$ and express them in terms of the stratification of $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ which are incorporated in the model $(U_n, p_n)$. In the result we provide the description of cycles in $X_n$, inductively on $ n. $ We obtain as well explicit formulas for $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology groups for $X_5$ and $X_6$. The results for $X_5$ recover by different method the results from Buchstaber and Terzi\'c (2021) and S\"uss (2020). The results for $X_6$ we consider to be new.</description>

      <title>Seshadri constants on $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$, and a solution to the symplectic packing problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the $r$-point Seshadri constant on $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$ for those line bundles where the answer might be expected to be governed by $(-1)$-curves. As a consequence we solve the symplectic packing problem for $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. Some results on the $r$-point Seshadri constant for other line bundles are given. These latter results use a useful new "reflection method".
  In the analysis there is a striking difference between the cases when $r$ is odd and when $r$ is even. When $r$ is even the problem admits an infinite order automorphism, and there are infinitely many $(-1)$-curves to consider. In contrast, when $r$ is odd only a finite number (usually $4$) types of $(-1)$-curves are relevant to our answer.</description>

In particular, we derive L\^e-Iomdine formulas with inequalities and use these, together with Teissier's Minkowski inequalities for sectional Milnor numbers of isolated hypersurface singularities, to arrive at ``Minkowski inequalities'' for L\^e numbers.</description>

      <title>Canonical Filtrations of Finite-Dimensional Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study canonical filtrations of finite-dimensional associative algebras and Lie algebras. These filtrations are defined via optimal destabilizing one-parameter subgroups in the sense of geometric invariant theory (GIT), and appear to be a new invariant of finite-dimensional algebras. We establish some fundamental properties of these filtrations, and show that an algebra is semisimple if and only if it is GIT semistable. We give a method to compute canonical filtrations of algebras whose automorphism group or module of derivations is sufficiently rich, and use this to compute these filtrations in examples when the automorphism group contains a sufficiently large torus. We also obtain some results on the structure of the associated graded algebra of the canonical filtration of an associative algebra.</description>

      <title>Signed projective cubes, a homomorphism point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (signed) projective cubes, as a special class of graphs closely related to the hypercubes, are on the crossroad of geometry, algebra, discrete mathematics and linear algebra. Defined as Cayley graphs on binary groups, they represent basic linear dependencies. Capturing the four-color theorem as a homomorphism target they show how mapping of discrete objects, namely graphs, may relate to special mappings of plane to projective spaces of higher dimensions. In this work, viewed as a signed graph, first we present a number of equivalent definitions each of which leads to a different development. In particular, the new notion of common product of signed graphs is introduced which captures both Cartesian and tensor products of graphs. We then have a look at some of their homomorphism properties. We first introduce an inverse technique for the basic no-homomorphism lemma, using which we show that every signed projective cube is of circular chromatic number 4. Then observing that the 4-color theorem is about mapping planar graphs into signed projective cube of dimension 2, we study some conjectures in extension of 4CT. Toward a better understanding of these conjectures we present the notion of extended double cover as a key operation in formulating the conjectures. With a deeper look into connection between some of these graphs and algebraic geometry, we discover that projective cube of dimension 4, widely known as the Clebsh graph, but also known as Greenwood-Gleason graph, is the intersection graph of the 16 straight lines of an algebraic surface known as Segre surface, which is a Del Pezzo surface of degree 4. We note that an algebraic surface known as the Clebsch surface is one of the most symmetric presentations of a cubic surface. Recall that each smooth cubic surface contains 27 lines. Hence, from hereafter, we believe, a proper name for this graph should be Segre graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.04714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book presents two important results in p-adic Hodge theory following the approach initiated by Faltings, namely (i) his main p-adic comparison theorem, and (ii) the Hodge-Tate spectral sequence. We establish for each of these results two versions, an absolute one and a relative one. While the absolute statements can reasonably be considered as well understood, particularly after their extension to rigid varieties by Scholze, Faltings' initial approach for the relative variants has remained much less studied. Although we follow the same strategy as that used by Faltings to establish his main p-adic comparison theorem, part of our proofs is based on new results. The relative Hodge-Tate spectral sequence is new in this approach.</description>

      <title>Orbits of the left-right equivalence of maps in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The germs of maps (k^n,o)\to(k^p,o) are traditionally studied up to the right, left-right or contact equivalence. Various questions about the group-orbits are reduced to their tangent spaces. Classically the passage from the tangent spaces to the orbits was done by vector fields integration, hence it was bound to the real/complex-analytic or C^r-category.
  The purely-algebraic (characteristic-free) approach to the group-orbits of right and contact equivalence has been developed during the last decades. But those methods could not address the (essentially more complicated) left-right equivalence. Moreover, the characteristic-free results (in the right/contact cases) were weaker than those in characteristic zero, because of the (inevitable) pathologies of positive characteristic.
  In this paper we close these omissions.
  * We establish the general (characteristic-free) passage from the tangent spaces to the groups orbits for the groups of right, contact and let-right equivalence. Submodules of the tangent spaces ensure (shifted) submodules of the group-orbits.
  For the left-right equivalence this extends (and strengthens) various classical results of Mather, Gaffney, du Plessis, and others.
  * A filtration on the space of maps induces the filtration on the group and on the tangent space.
  We establish the criteria of type "$T_{G^{(j)}}f$ vs $G^{(j)} f$" in their strongest form, for arbitrary base field/ring, provided the characteristic is zero or high for a given map. This brings the "inevitably weaker" results of char&gt;0 to the level of char=0.
  * As an auxiliary step, important on its own, we develop the mixed-module structure of the tangent space to the left-right group and establish various properties of the annihilator ideal (that defines the instability locus of the map).</description>

Abstract: A toric code, introduced by Hansen to extend the Reed-Solomon code as a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, is determined by a toric variety or its associated integral convex polytope $P \subseteq [0,q-2]^n$, where $k=|P \cap \mathbb{Z}^n|$ (the number of integer lattice points of $P$). There are two relevant parameters that determine the quality of a code: the information rate, which measures how much information is contained in a single bit of each codeword; and the relative minimum distance, which measures how many errors can be corrected relative to how many bits each codeword has. Soprunov and Soprunova defined a good infinite family of codes to be a sequence of codes of unbounded polytope dimension such that neither the corresponding information rates nor relative minimum distances go to 0 in the limit. We examine different ways of constructing families of codes by considering polytope operations such as the join and direct sum. In doing so, we give conditions under which no good family can exist and strong evidence that there is no such good family of codes.</description>

Abstract: Based on a relative Wu theorem in \'etale cohomology, we study the compatibility of Steenrod operations on Chow groups and on \'etale cohomology. Using the resulting obstructions to algebraicity, we construct new examples of non-algebraic cohomology classes over various fields ($\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{R}$, $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$, $\mathbb{F}_q$).
  We also use Steenrod operations to study the mod $2$ cohomology classes of a compact $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}$ manifold $M$ that are algebraizable, i.e. algebraic on some real algebraic model of $M$. We give new examples of algebraizable and non-algebraizable classes, answering questions of Benedetti, Ded\`o and Kucharz.</description>

      <title>Correspondance de Simpson p-adique II : fonctorialit\'e par image directe propre et syst\`emes locaux de Hodge-Tate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faltings initiated in 2005 a p-adic analogue of the (complex) Simpson correspondence whose construction has been taken up by various authors, according to several approaches. Following the one we initiated previously, we develop in this new monograph new features of the p-adic Simpson correspondence, inspired by our construction of the relative Hodge-Tate spectral sequence. First, we address the connection to Hodge-Tate local systems. Second, we establish the functoriality of the p-adic Simpson correspondence by proper direct image. Along the way, we expand the scope of our original construction.
  Faltings a d\'egag\'e en 2005 un analogue p-adique de la correspondance de Simpson (complexe) dont la construction a \'et\'e reprise par diff\'erents auteurs, selon plusieurs approches. Poursuivant celle que nous avons initi\'ee pr\'ec\'edemment, nous d\'eveloppons dans la pr\'esente monographie de nouveaux aspects de la correspondance de Simpson p-adique, inspir\'es par notre construction de la suite spectrale de Hodge-Tate relative. Nous traitons tout d'abord du lien avec les syst\`emes locaux de Hodge-Tate. Nous \'etablissons ensuite la fonctorialit\'e de la correspondance de Simpson p-adique par image directe propre. Chemin faisant, nous \'elargissons la port\'ee de notre construction initiale.</description>

We establish the Green-Lazarsfeld Secant Conjecture for curves of genus g in all the divisorial case, that is, when the line bundles that fail to be (p+1)-very ample form a divisor in the Jacobian of the curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit characterization of the standard monomials for positroid varieties with respect to the Hodge degeneration and give a Gr\"obner basis. Furthermore, we show that promotion and evacuation biject standard monomials of a positroid variety with those of its cyclic shifts and $w_0$-reflection, respectively. The connection to promotion allows us to identify standard monomials of a positroid variety with Lam's cyclic Demazure crystal. Using a recurrence on the Hilbert series, we give an inductive formula for the character of cyclic Demazure modules.</description>

      <title>Results on left-right approximation for k-Nash morphisms and for k-analytic morphisms of weakly finite singularity type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard Artin approximation (AP) is not readily applicable to the left-right equivalence of morphisms Maps((k^n,o),(k^m,o)). Moreover, the na\"ive extension does not hold in the k-analytic case, because of Osgood-Gabrielov-Shiota examples.
  The left-right version of Artin approximation (LRAP) was established by M. Shiota for morphisms that are either Nash or [real-analytic and of finite singularity type]. We establish LRAP and its stronger version of P{\l}oski (LRAPP) for Maps(X,Y) where X,Y are k-analytic/k-Nash germs of schemes of any characteristic.
  More precisely:
  *(k-algebraic power series, k&lt;x&gt;/J_X and k&lt;y&gt;/J_Y) LRAP, LRAPP, the inverse Artin approximation (and its P{\l}oski's version) hold for any morphism.
  *(k-analytic power series, k{x}/J_X and k{y}/J_Y) LRAP, LRAPP, the inverse Artin approximation (and its P{\l}oski's version) hold for finite morphisms.
  * LRAP holds for analytic morphisms of weakly-finite singularity type.
  This later class of morphisms of ``weakly-finite singularity type" (which we introduce) is of separate importance. It extends naturally the class of morphisms of ``finite singularity type", while preserving their non-pathological behaviour. The definition goes via the higher critical loci of morphisms with singular target. (The critical locus Crit_X f is defined via the Zariski-Lipman sequence.)
  We establish basic properties of these critical loci. In particular: any map is finitely (right) determined by its higher singular loci.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of affine ADE Nakajima quiver varieties via collapsing fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a universal substitution formula that compares generating series of Euler characteristics of Nakajima quiver varieties associated with affine ADE diagrams at generic and at certain nongeneric stability conditions via a study of collapsing fibres in the associated variation of GIT map, unifying and generalising earlier results of the last two authors with N\'emethi and of Nakajima. As a special case, we compute generating series of Euler characteristics of noncommutative Quot schemes of Kleinian orbifolds. In type A and rank 1, we give a second, combinatorial proof of our substitution formula, using torus localisation and partition enumeration. This gives a combinatorial model of the fibers of the variation of GIT map, and also leads to relations between our results and the representation theory of the affine and finite Lie algebras in type A.</description>

      <title>Derived Moduli Spaces of Nonlinear PDEs I: Singular Propagations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a sheaf theoretic and derived geometric machinery to study nonlinear partial differential equations and their singular supports. We establish a notion of derived microlocalization for solution spaces of non-linear equations and develop a formalism to pose and solve singular non-linear Cauchy problems globally. Using this approach we estimate the domains of propagation for the solutions of non-linear systems. It is achieved by exploiting the fact that one may greatly enrich and simplify the study of derived non-linear PDEs over a space $X$ by studying its derived linearization which is a module over the sheaf of functions on the $S^1$-equivariant derived loop stack $\mathcal{L}X$.</description>

Abstract: A geometric study is given for the 4-dimensional Garnier system. By the resolution of indeterminacy, the group of its B\"aklund transformations is lifted to a group of pseudo-isomorphisms between rational varieties obtained from ${\mathbb P}^2 \times {\mathbb P}^2$ by 10 or 21 blow-ups. The root basis is discussed in the N\'eron-Severi bilattices for the space with 10 blow-ups.</description>

As an application, we show over a field of characteristic zero that the power structure on the Grothendieck-Witt ring introduced by Pajwani-P\'al computes the compactly supported $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristic of symmetric powers for all curves.</description>

Abstract: The Markov triples, that means the positive integer solutions of the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz$, form the vertex set of the Markov tree. Each Markov triple defines a weighted projective plane, which gives a geometric interpretation of the vertex. We exhibit a class of rational, projective $\mathbb{C}^*$-surfaces representing the edges of the Markov tree in the sense that they admit coverings onto the adjacent weighted projective planes. Our main result shows that the surfaces representing the Markov tree are precisely the normal degenerations of the projective plane admitting a non-trivial $\mathbb{C}^*$-action.</description>

      <title>A refined Weyl character formula for comodules on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09210v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be any commutative unital ring and let $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ be the general linear group scheme on $A$ of rank $2$. We study the representation theory of $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ and the symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$, where $(V, \Delta)$ is the standard right comodule on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. We prove a refined Weyl character formula for $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$. There is for any integer $d \geq 1$ a (canonical) refined weight space decomposition $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V) \cong \oplus_i \operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ where each direct summand $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ is a comodule on $N \subseteq \operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. Here $N$ is the schematic normalizer of the diagonal torus $T \subseteq \operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. We prove a character formula for the direct summands of $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$ for any integer $d \geq 1$. This refined Weyl character formula implies the classical Weyl character formula. As a Corollary we get a refined Weyl character formula for the pull back $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V \otimes K)$ as a comodule on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,K}$ where $K$ is any field. We also calculate explicit examples involving the symmetric powers, symmetric tensors and their duals. The refined weight space decomposition exists in general for group schemes such as $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ and $\operatorname{SL}_{2,A}$. The study may have applications to the study of groups $G$ such as $\operatorname{SL}(n,k)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$ and quotients $G/H$ where $k$ is an arbitrary field (or a Dedekind domain) and $H \subseteq G$ is a closed subgroup. The refined weight space decomposition of $S_{\lambda}(V)$ has a relation with irreducible module over a field of positiv characteristic. In an example I prove it recovers the irreducible module $V(\lambda) \subsetneq S_{\lambda}(V)$.</description>

Abstract: We compute the monodromy of the mirabolic Harish-Chandra D-module for all values of the parameters (theta,c) in rank 1, and outside an explicit codimension 2 set of values in ranks 2 and higher. This shows in particular that the Finkelberg-Ginzburg conjecture, which is known to hold for generic values of (theta,c), fails at special values even in rank 1. Our main tools are Opdam's shift operators and intertwiners for the extended affine Weyl group, which allow for the resolution of resonances outside the codimension two set.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of arbitrary characteristic. We prove the following:
  $\bullet$ Let $B=k^{[3]}$ and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}(B)$ be non-trivial. If the plinth ideal $(\mathrm{pl} (\delta))$ contains a quasi-basic element, then the ring of invariants ($B^{\delta}$) is $k^{[2]}$.
  $\bullet$ Let $B=R^{[n]}$, where $R$ is a $k$-domain and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}_R(B)$ is a triangular exponential map. Then $B^{\delta}$ is non-rigid.
  We prove the following results for a $k$-domain $R$ when the characteristic of $k$ is zero:
  $\bullet$ The kernel of any triangular $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.
  $\bullet$ The kernel of any linear locally nilpotent $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau periods for black hole scattering in classical general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-precision description of black hole scattering in classical general relativity using the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion requires the evaluation of single-scale Feynman integrals at increasing loop orders. Up to 4PM, the scattering angle and the impulse are expressible in terms of polylogarithmic functions and Calabi-Yau (CY) two-fold periods. As in QFT, periods of higher dimensional CY n-folds are expected at higher PM order. We find at 5PM in the dissipative leading order self-force sector (5PM-1SF) that the only non-polylogarithmic functions are the K3 periods encountered before and the ones of a new hypergeometric CY three-fold. In the 5PM-2SF sector further CY two- and three-fold periods appear. Griffiths transversality of the CY period motives allows to transform the differential equations for the master integrals into $\epsilon$-factorized form and to solve them in terms of a well controlled function space, as we demonstrate in the 5PM-1SF sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a correspondence $V$ between a connected Shimura variety $S$, a commutative connected algebraic group $G$, and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we prove that the $V$-images of any $n$ special points on $S$ outside a proper Zariski closed subset are algebraically independent. Our result unifies previous unlikely intersection results on multiplicative independence and linear independence. We prove multiplicative independence of differences of singular moduli, generalizing previous results by Pila-Tsimerman, and Aslanlyan-Eterovi\'c-Fowler. We also give an application to abelian varieties by proving that the special points of $S$ whose $V$-images lie in a finite-rank subgroup of $T$ are contained in a finite union of proper special subvarieties of $S$, only dependent on the rank of the subgroup. In this way, our result is a generalization of the works of Pila-Tsimerman and Buium-Poonen.</description>
