      <title>Identifying efficient routes to laminarization: an optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherently nonlinear and chaotic nature of turbulent flows poses a major challenge for designing control strategies to maintain or induce low-drag laminar states. In this work, we study the concept of the minimal seed for relaminarization - the smallest perturbation of a turbulent state that triggers a direct transition to laminar flow without a chaotic transient. We formulate the identification of this optimal perturbation as a fully nonlinear optimization problem and develop a numerical framework based on a multi-step penalty method to compute it. Applying this framework to the nine-mode Moehlis-Faisst-Eckhardt model of a sinusoidal shear flow, we compute the minimal seeds for both transition to turbulence and relaminarization. While both of these minimal seeds lie infinitesimally close to the laminar-turbulent boundary -- the so-called edge of chaos -- they are generally unrelated and lie in qualitatively distinct regions of state space, thereby providing different insights into the flow's underlying structure. We find that while the optimal perturbation for triggering transition is primarily in the direction of the mode representing streamwise vortices, or rolls, the optimal perturbation for relaminarization is distributed across multiple modes, without strong contributions in the roll or streak directions. While counterintuitive, this finding indicates that fully nonlinear control schemes exploiting the structure of the turbulent attractor might offer great improvements over classical methods based on linearizations and those which simply counteract the dominant features of the turbulent flow. The laminarizing trajectory obtained from the minimal seed for relaminarization also provides an efficient pathway out of the turbulent region of state space to the laminar state and can therefore inform the design and evaluation of flow control strategies for inducing laminarization.</description>

      <title>Boundary layers in quasi-static magnetoconvection with a vertical field and their implications for heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transport in quasi-static magnetoconvection with a vertical magnetic field in a plane layer geometry is investigated with direct numerical simulations and asymptotic theory in the limit of large Chandrasekhar number ($Q$). It is shown that thermal and magnetic boundary layers with thickness $O(Q^{-1/6})$, of the same order as the horizontal scale of the convection, are persistent over the range of investigated parameters. Thermal boundary layer control of the heat transport indicates that the Nusselt number depends on $Q$, suggesting that no asymptotic state of heat transport independent of $Q$ occurs in this system. The magnetic boundary layers necessitate leading order modifications to the dominant vertical force balance as well as the amplitude of the horizontal induced magnetic field near the boundaries. The scaling behavior of the thermal boundary layer and resulting heat transport is found to be independent of the choice of mechanical and electromagnetic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Internal flow and concentration in neighbouring evaporating binary droplets and rivulets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the evaporation of neighbouring multi-component droplets or rivulets - often found in applications such as inkjet printing, spray cooling, and pesticide delivery - is studied numerically and theoretically. The proximity induces a shielding effect that reduces individual evaporation rates and disrupts the symmetry of both the concentration profile and the flow field in the liquids. We examine how the symmetry of flow and concentration fields is affected by key parameters, namely the contact angle, the inter-droplet (or inter-rivulet) distance, and the magnitude of surface tension gradient forces (i.e. the Marangoni number). We focus on binary mixtures, such as water and 1,2-hexanediol, where only one component evaporates and evaporation is slow, thereby allowing simplifications to the governing equations. To manage the complexity of the full three-dimensional droplet problem, we begin with a two-dimensional model of neighbouring rivulets. Solving the complete transient equations for rivulets with pinned contact lines and fixed inter-rivulet distance reveals that the asymmetry - quantified by the position of the interfacial stagnation point of the flow - diminishes over time. Using a validated quasi-stationary model, we find, with increasing contact angle and inter-rivulet distance, that the stagnation point migrates closer to the centre, yet it remains unaffected by the Marangoni number. A simplified lubrication model applied to droplets shows similar dependencies on contact angle and distance, although here the stagnation point appears to vary with the Marangoni number. We attribute this dependence to the additional azimuthal flow in droplets, leading to a non-linear evolution of the concentration and therefore a non-trivial dependence of the symmetry on the Marangoni number.</description>

      <title>Saddle-node bifurcation during the relaminarization of turbulent puffs in pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent puffs in a pipe persist for a long time before abruptly transitioning to laminar flow through viscous exponential decay. Direct numerical simulation results reveal a saddle-node bifurcation sequence governing the final relaminarization stage. Specifically, a universal square-root scaling law in the annihilation of critical points that is indicative of a saddle-node bifurcation. The Riccati equation has been proposed as a straightforward approach to modeling these bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Oblique Detonation Initiation Assisted by Local Energy Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable initiation of oblique detonation waves (ODWs) is crucial for the stable operation of oblique detonation engines (ODEs), especially under flight conditions of low Mach numbers and/or high altitudes. In this case, conventional initiation approaches relying solely on a fixed-angle wedge may engender risks of initiation failure, which necessitates extra initiation assistance measures. In this study, ODW initiation over a finite wedge with local energy deposition is numerically investigated to assess the thermal effects of plasma-based initiation assistance techniques. Particular emphasis is put on the effects of forms and magnitudes of energy deposition on initiation modes and flow field structures of ODWs. The results demonstrate that on-wedge initiation of ODWs fails at a low Mach number without any energy depositions. In contrast, both continuous and pulsatile local energy depositions can effectively initiate ODWs, leading to sustainable detonation on the finite wedge. As continuous energy deposition power or pulsatile single pulse energy increases, several key detonation initiation modes emerge sequentially. Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of the primary wave structures under single-pulse energy deposition reveals the minimum pulse repetition frequency required for sustainable on-wedge detonation, which is subsequently verified through multi-pulse energy deposition simulations. Nevertheless, it is found that sustainable on-wedge detonation can be achieved by pulsatile energy deposition with an average power consumption of less than 10% of that required for continuous energy deposition while maintaining a same initiation length, suggesting that the pulsatile one is an efficient way of energy deposition for initiation assistance of ODWs on finite wedges under extreme flight conditions.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for hydrodynamic stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A machine-learning strategy for investigating the stability of fluid flow problems is proposed herein. The goal is to provide a simple yet robust methodology to find a nonlinear mapping from the parametric space to an indicator representing the probability of observing a bifurcated solution. The computational procedure is demonstrably robust and does not require parameter tuning. The essential feature of the strategy is that the computational solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is a reliable proxy for laboratory experiments investigating sensitivity to flow parameters. The applicability of our probabilistic bifurcation detection strategy is demonstrated by an investigation of two classical examples of flow instability associated with thermal convection. The codes used to generate and process the labelled data are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A consistent treatment of dynamic contact angles in the sharp-interface framework with the generalized Navier boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the Generalized Navier Boundary condition (GNBC) introduced by Qian et al.\ in the sharp interface Volume-of-Fluid context. We replace the singular uncompensated Young stress by a smooth function with a characteristic width $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ that is understood as a physical parameter of the model. Therefore, we call the model the ``Contact Region GNBC'' (CR-GNBC). We show that the model is consistent with the fundamental kinematics of the contact angle transport described by Fricke, K\"ohne and Bothe. We implement the model in the geometrical Volume-of-Fluid solver Basilisk using a ``free angle'' approach. This means that the dynamic contact angle is not prescribed but reconstructed from the interface geometry and subsequently applied as an input parameter to compute the uncompensated Young stress. We couple this approach to the two-phase Navier Stokes solver and study the withdrawing tape problem with a receding contact line. It is shown that the model allows for grid-independent solutions and leads to a full regularization of the singularity at the moving contact line, which is in accordance with the thin-film equation subject to this boundary condition. In particular, it is shown that the curvature at the moving contact line is finite and mesh converging. As predicted by the fundamental kinematics, the parallel shear stress component vanishes at the moving contact line for quasi-stationary states (i.e. for $\dot{\theta}_d=0$) and the dynamic contact angle is determined by a balance between the uncompensated Young stress and an effective contact line friction. Furthermore, a non-linear generalization of the model is proposed, which aims at reproducing the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Blake and Haynes for quasi-stationary states.</description>

      <title>Viscoplasticity can stabilise liquid collar motion on vertical cylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid films coating vertical cylinders can form annular liquid collars which translate downwards under gravity. We investigate the dynamics of a thin viscoplastic liquid film coating the interior or exterior of a vertical cylindrical tube, quantifying how the yield stress modifies both the Rayleigh-Plateau instability leading to collar formation and the translation of collars down the tube. We use thin-film theory to derive an evolution equation for the layer thickness, which we solve numerically to examine the nonlinear dynamics. Instability and collar formation occur when gravity is sufficiently strong to make the fluid yield initially. We use matched asymptotics to derive a model describing the quasi-steady translation of a slender liquid collar when the Bond number is small. The structure of the asymptotic solution for a viscoplastic collar shares some features with the Newtonian version, but there are several novel asymptotic regions that emerge at the two ends of the collar. The global force balance, which determines the collar's speed, is modified by a leading-order contribution from viscous drag in the collar when the liquid is viscoplastic. We use the asymptotic model to describe slow changes in collar volume when the film thicknesses ahead of, and behind, the collar are unequal. When the film thickness ahead of the collar is less than a critical value that we determine, viscoplastic collars adjust their volume and reach a steadily-translating state. This contrasts with the Newtonian problem, where the only state in which steady translation occurs is unstable to small changes in the film thickness.</description>

      <title>Statistical machine learning tools for probabilistic closures of turbulence models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flow remains a challenging subject, despite extensive efforts to find analytical descriptions. Modeling small scales of motion is crucial for saving time and resources in numerical simulations, particularly in industrial applications. Here we attempt to model small scales of motion by creating closures for a Shell model of turbulence, more specifically for Sabra. Shell models are infinite dimensional dynamical systems that retain most key properties of Navier-Stokes equation, such as energy cascade and intermittency, while being computationally treatable. To account for Sabra's intermittent fluctuations we employ a set of scaling relations that recover a hidden symmetry and leaves us with universal statistics across the inertial range. On data from these rescaled variables we then adapt and apply two machine learning tools, a variational auto-encoder and sparse identification of non-linear dynamics. We estimate the data's densities and dynamics in order to then generate new instances of data. Given a mid-inertial range cutoff scale, we evolve reduced models in time, resolving only scales of motion larger than the cutoff scale, closing the reduced model with data generated by the machine learning tools. We compare statistics of our reduced models against a Sabra's fully resolved simulation to evaluate each closure's performances. Our results show improvement regarding previous work, and all our closures are probabilistic and cutoff-independent.</description>

      <title>Mass diffusion and bending in dynamic wetting by phase-field and sharp interface models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic wetting poses a well-known challenge in classical sharp interface formulation as the no-slip wall condition leads to a contact line singularity that is typically regularized with a Navier boundary condition, often requiring empirical fitting for the slip length. On the other hand, this paradox does not appear in phase-field models as the contact line moves through diffusive mass transport. In this work, we present a toy model that accounts for mass diffusion at the contact line within a sharp interface framework. This model is based on a theoretical relation derived from the Cahn-Hilliard equations, which links the total diffusive mass transport to the curvature at the wall. From an estimate of the chemical potential on a curved interface, we obtain an expression for the width of the highly curved region $\delta$ and the apparent angle. In the sharp interface model, we then introduce a fictitious boundary, displaced by a distance $\delta$ into the domain, where a Navier boundary condition is applied along a dynamic apparent contact angle that accounts for the local interface bending. The robustness of the model is assessed by comparing the toy model results with standard phase field ones on two cases: the steady state profiles of a liquid bridge between two plates moving in opposite directions and the transient behaviors of a drop spreading on a solid with a prescribed equilibrium angle. This offers a practical and efficient alternative to solve contact line problems at lower cost in a sharp interface framework with input parameters from phase field models.</description>

      <title>Drops can Perpetually Bounce over a Vibrating Wettable Solid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the surface of a vibrating liquid bath, instead of coalescing, a drop will continually bounce on a thin film of air between the drop and the free surface, giving rise to rich chaotic dynamics and quantum analog behavior. However, perpetual bouncing is yet to be demonstrated on a vibrating rigid solid, where the control of the drop's motion is not limited by the bath dynamics. Here we show that vibration of an atomically smooth mica surface prolongs a drop's hovering state by several orders of magnitude, increasing the time to wet from less than a second to several minutes. The excitation of the second spherical harmonic mode determines a transition between a bouncing state with high-amplitude rebounds, and a bound state, where the drop's motion is locked onto the vibrating solid above a thin air layer. We further develop a coupled linear spring model, accounting for the drop's deformation, that predicts bouncing trajectories without fitting parameters. Our results extend the scope of bouncing drop studies beyond the liquid bath and highlight the potential for precision manipulation of small liquid quantities in air.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pipe flow is a canonical example where turbulence first appears intermittently in space and time, taking the form of localized structures termed puffs. Turbulence spreads via puff self-replication, which must out-compete puff decays to sustain it. Here we study the self-replication process, a transition from one to two puffs, using direct numerical simulations. We identify an edge state on the phase space boundary between the two states, demonstrate that it mediates the transition, and show that self-replication follows a previously proposed mechanism, with the edge state as its tipping point.</description>

Abstract: Using results of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations, it is shown that cross-helicity can dominate power spectra of the magnetic field generated by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo in a chaotic/turbulent von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n flow and its numerical analogue (simulation). The theoretical consideration is based on a Kolmogorov-like phenomenology within the framework of the distributed chaos concept.

      <description>arXiv:2508.04558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal and riverine hydrokinetic turbines offer promising solutions for renewable energy generation in aquatic environments. However, their ecological impact, especially on fish behavior, warrants a thorough investigation. This study presents an integrated experimental and computational analysis of fish turbine interactions, combining laboratory observations with high fidelity large eddy simulations. The simulations capture essential flow features, including wake asymmetry, vortex shedding, and spatial variations in turbulence intensity, under varying flow and rotational regimes of a geometry resolved vertical axis turbine. Behavioral experiments with rainbow trout reveal a consistent tendency to avoid high turbulence and high shear regions, favoring low turbulence zones such as downstream sidewalls. Hydrodynamic stressors and energetic demands were characterized using turbulence metrics, including turbulence kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and integral length scale, along with estimations of fish generated thrust force. Our results demonstrate that turbine induced turbulence significantly influences fish movement and habitat selection, highlighting the need to consider behavioral responses in conventional fish injury assessment frameworks. These findings provide critical insights for designing and operating hydrokinetic turbines in ecologically sensitive waters, ensuring a balance between renewable energy extraction and aquatic ecosystem protection.</description>

Abstract: In this study, three-dimensional simulations of a reacting hydrogen jet in supersonic crossflow using a structure-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation are examined. The hydrogen jet, with a momentum flux ratio of five, is injected into a high enthalpy crossflow. The sensitivities of the solution to the grid element size and polynomial order are investigated to determine an accurate and computationally efficient approach to simulating high-speed airbreathing propulsion vehicles. The results demonstrate that DG(p = 2) solutions, which are nominally third-order accurate in smooth regions of the flow, show reasonable agreement with existing experimental results. The separation shock formation behind the jet is found to be heavily grid dependent and necessary for accurate simulations of the reacting jet in supersonic crossflow. It is determined that the highest resolution cell and polynomial order is required to capture the upstream separation shock and consequently the flame stabilization point. The mixing and combustion mode is also determined using the flame index and demonstrates the flow is heavily skewed towards a non-premixed diffusion mode which is consistent with previously run simulations of this case using traditional finite volume schemes and sub grid scale modeling approaches. Beyond this analysis, given the prevalent use of structured hexahedral meshes in the computation of realistic high-speed, chemically reacting flows, the novelty of this work lies in demonstrating accurate simulation of such a flow on a fully unstructured tetrahedral mesh. This highlights the potential of these methods to handle both complicated geometries and complex physics.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-lean premixed hydrogen combustion is a possible solution to decarbonize industry, while limiting flame temperatures and thus nitrous oxide emissions. These lean hydrogen/air flames experience strong preferential diffusion effects, which result in thermo-diffusive (TD) instabilities. To efficiently and accurately model lean premixed hydrogen flames, it is crucial to incorporate these preferential diffusion effects into flamelet tabulated chemistry frameworks, such as the Flamelet-Generated Manifold (FGM) method. This is challenging because the preferential diffusion terms in the control variable transport equations contain diffusion fluxes of all species in the mechanism. In this work, a new implementation is presented; the full term is reduced by only considering the most contributing species. When carefully selecting this set of major species, preferential diffusion fluxes along the flame front, i.e., cross-diffusion, can be captured. This is particularly important for manifolds that include heat loss effects, where enthalpy is one of the control variables. The diffusion of the H-radical has a significant contribution to the enthalpy transport equation, and cross-diffusion of the H-radical is non-negligible. Two manifolds, without and with heat loss effects, and the set of major species are analyzed in an a-priori and a-posteriori manner. Simulations of TD unstable hydrogen-air flames with detailed chemistry and several FGM models show that accurately capturing cross-diffusion of enthalpy is important for correctly predicting the flame shape and dynamics.</description>
