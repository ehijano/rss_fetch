      <title>Enhancing Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimators for Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels (referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover, we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more realistic reconstructed images.</description>

      <title>Deep histological synthesis from mass spectrometry imaging for multimodal registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively, compared to a baseline U-Net model.

      <title>Reliable Evaluation of MRI Motion Correction: Dataset and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correcting motion artifacts in MRI is important, as they can hinder accurate diagnosis. However, evaluating deep learning-based and classical motion correction methods remains fundamentally difficult due to the lack of accessible ground-truth target data. To address this challenge, we study three evaluation approaches: real-world evaluation based on reference scans, simulated motion, and reference-free evaluation, each with its merits and shortcomings. To enable evaluation with real-world motion artifacts, we release PMoC3D, a dataset consisting of unprocessed Paired Motion-Corrupted 3D brain MRI data. To advance evaluation quality, we introduce MoMRISim, a feature-space metric trained for evaluating motion reconstructions. We assess each evaluation approach and find real-world evaluation together with MoMRISim, while not perfect, to be most reliable. Evaluation based on simulated motion systematically exaggerates algorithm performance, and reference-free evaluation overrates oversmoothed deep learning outputs.</description>

      <title>Implicit Neural Representation-Based MRI Reconstruction Method with Sensitivity Map Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely utilized diagnostic tool in clinical settings, but its application is limited by the relatively long acquisition time. As a result, fast MRI reconstruction has become a significant area of research. In recent years, Implicit Neural Representation (INR), as a scan-specific method, has demonstrated outstanding performance in fast MRI reconstruction without fully-sampled images for training. High acceleration reconstruction poses a challenging problem, and a key component in achieving high-quality reconstruction with much few data is the accurate estimation of coil sensitivity maps. However, most INR-based methods apply regularization constraints solely to the generated images, while overlooking the characteristics of the coil sensitivity maps. To handle this, this work proposes a joint coil sensitivity map and image estimation network, termed INR-CRISTAL. The proposed INR-CRISTAL introduces an extra sensitivity map regularization in the INR networks to make use of the smooth characteristics of the sensitivity maps. Experimental results show that INR-CRISTAL provides more accurate coil sensitivity estimates with fewer artifacts, and delivers superior reconstruction performance in terms of artifact removal and structure preservation. Moreover, INR-CRISTAL demonstrates stronger robustness to automatic calibration signals and the acceleration rate compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>FPDANet: A Multi-Section Classification Model for Intelligent Screening of Fetal Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation. However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task, and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges. Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales, thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively, and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of FPDANet.</description>

      <title>LinGuinE: Longitudinal Guidance Estimation for Volumetric Lung Tumour Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours. A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration. A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour; these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p&lt; 0.05) across 63 longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields the best results on both test datasets.</description>

      <title>DermaCon-IN: A Multi-concept Annotated Dermatological Image Dataset of Indian Skin Disorders for Clinical AI Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet), transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>A Compendium of Autonomous Navigation using Object Detection and Tracking in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part of the national security and provide the most valuable service during surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals, there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.</description>

      <title>TriPSS: A Tri-Modal Keyframe Extraction Framework Using Perceptual, Structural, and Semantic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space, deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.</description>

      <title>Talk2SAM: Text-Guided Semantic Enhancement for Complex-Shaped Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries, leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ, enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K. Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\% boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods fail.

      <description>arXiv:2506.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically, we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore, cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Aerial Multi-View Stereo via Adaptive Depth Range Inference and Normal Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU, LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Integrating Complexity and Biological Realism: High-Performance Spiking Neural Networks for Breast Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) event-driven nature enables efficient encoding of spatial and temporal features, making them suitable for dynamic time-dependent data processing. Despite their biological relevance, SNNs have seen limited application in medical image recognition due to difficulties in matching the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose a novel breast cancer classification approach that combines SNNs with Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) a computationally efficient measure of sequence complexity. LZC enhances the interpretability and accuracy of spike-based models by capturing structural patterns in neural activity. Our study explores both biophysical Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neuron models under supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid learning regimes. Experiments were conducted on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using numerical features derived from medical imaging. LB-based models consistently exceeded 90.00% accuracy, while LIF-based models reached over 85.00%. The highest accuracy of 98.25% was achieved using an ANN-to-SNN conversion method applied to both neuron models comparable to traditional deep learning with back-propagation, but at up to 100 times lower computational cost. This hybrid approach merges deep learning performance with the efficiency and plausibility of SNNs, yielding top results at lower computational cost. We hypothesize that the synergy between temporal-coding, spike-sparsity, and LZC-driven complexity analysis enables more-efficient feature extraction. Our findings demonstrate that SNNs combined with LZC offer promising, biologically plausible alternative to conventional neural networks in medical diagnostics, particularly for resource-constrained or real-time systems.</description>

      <title>LDPM: Towards undersampled MRI reconstruction with MR-VAE and Latent Diffusion Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models, as powerful generative models, have found a wide range of applications and shown great potential in solving image reconstruction problems. Some works attempted to solve MRI reconstruction with diffusion models, but these methods operate directly in pixel space, leading to higher computational costs for optimization and inference. Latent diffusion models, pre-trained on natural images with rich visual priors, are expected to solve the high computational cost problem in MRI reconstruction by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. However, direct application to MRI reconstruction faces three key challenges: (1) absence of explicit control mechanisms for medical fidelity, (2) domain gap between natural images and MR physics, and (3) undefined data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a novel Latent Diffusion Prior-based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. Our LDPM framework addresses these challenges by: (1) a sketch-guided pipeline with a two-step reconstruction strategy, which balances perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity, (2) an MRI-optimized VAE (MR-VAE), which achieves an improvement of approximately 3.92 dB in PSNR for undersampled MRI reconstruction compared to that with SD-VAE \cite{sd}, and (3) Dual-Stage Sampler, a modified version of spaced DDPM sampler, which enforces high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset\cite{fastmri} demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method and its robustness across various scenarios. The effectiveness of each module is also verified through ablation experiments.</description>

      <title>Sketched Equivariant Imaging Regularization and Deep Internal Learning for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We apply our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework, which can be efficiently applied for test-time network adaptation. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach to accelerate both EI and Sketched-EI via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT and multicoil magnetic resonance image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computational acceleration over standard EI counterpart in single-input setting and network adaptation at test time.</description>

      <title>An Ensemble-Based Two-Step Framework for Classification of Pap Smear Cell Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection of cervical cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality by identifying precancerous lesions as soon as possible. As a result, the use of pap smear screening has significantly increased, leading to a growing demand for automated tools that can assist cytologists managing their rising workload. To address this, the Pap Smear Cell Classification Challenge (PS3C) has been organized in association with ISBI in 2025. This project aims to promote the development of automated tools for pap smear images classification. The analyzed images are grouped into four categories: healthy, unhealthy, both, and rubbish images which are considered as unsuitable for diagnosis. In this work, we propose a two-stage ensemble approach: first, a neural network determines whether an image is rubbish or not. If not, a second neural network classifies the image as containing a healthy cell, an unhealthy cell, or both.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization in MRI-Based Deep Learning Models for Total Knee Replacement Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19203v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state (DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with our approach outperforming the baseline model.</description>

      <title>Ophora: A Large-Scale Data-Driven Text-Guided Ophthalmic Surgical Video Generation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07449v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/mar-cry/Ophora.</description>

      <title>Rate-Accuracy Bounds in Visual Coding for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasingly, visual signals such as images, videos and point clouds are being captured solely for the purpose of automated analysis by computer vision models. Applications include traffic monitoring, robotics, autonomous driving, smart home, and many others. This trend has led to the need to develop compression strategies for these signals for the purpose of analysis rather than reconstruction, an area often referred to as "coding for machines." By drawing parallels with lossy coding of a discrete memoryless source, in this paper we derive rate-accuracy bounds on several popular problems in visual coding for machines, and compare these with state-of-the-art results from the literature. The comparison shows that the current results are at least an order of magnitude -- and in some cases two or three orders of magnitude -- away from the theoretical bounds in terms of the bitrate needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy. This, in turn, means that there is much room for improvement in the current methods for visual coding for machines.</description>

      <title>Subspecialty-Specific Foundation Model for Intelligent Gastrointestinal Pathology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden, necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&amp;E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.</description>

      <title>Enhancing pretraining efficiency for medical image segmentation via transferability metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, the scarcity of labeled training data poses a significant challenge when training deep neural networks. When using U-Net-style architectures, it is common practice to address this problem by pretraining the encoder part on a large general-purpose dataset like ImageNet. However, these methods are resource-intensive and do not guarantee improved performance on the downstream task. In this paper we investigate a variety of training setups on medical image segmentation datasets, using ImageNet-pretrained models. By examining over 300 combinations of models, datasets, and training methods, we find that shorter pretraining often leads to better results on the downstream task, providing additional proof to the well-known fact that the accuracy of the model on ImageNet is a poor indicator for downstream performance. As our main contribution, we introduce a novel transferability metric, based on contrastive learning, that measures how robustly a pretrained model is able to represent the target data. In contrast to other transferability scores, our method is applicable to the case of transferring from ImageNet classification to medical image segmentation. We apply our robustness score by measuring it throughout the pretraining phase to indicate when the model weights are optimal for downstream transfer. This reduces pretraining time and improves results on the target task.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Radiomic Distance (FRD): A Versatile Metric for Comparing Medical Imaging Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different distributions or domains is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning; for example, to evaluate the output quality of image generative models. Currently, metrics used for this task either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task, such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Distance/FID) from natural imaging, which we show insufficiently capture anatomical features. To this end, we introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images, FRD (Fr\'echet Radiomic Distance), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful, and interpretable image features. We show that FRD is superior to other image distribution metrics for a range of medical imaging applications, including out-of-domain (OOD) detection, the evaluation of image-to-image translation (by correlating more with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism), and the evaluation of unconditional image generation. Moreover, FRD offers additional benefits such as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes, sensitivity to image corruptions and adversarial attacks, feature interpretability, and correlation with radiologist-perceived image quality. Additionally, we address key gaps in the literature by presenting an extensive framework for the multifaceted evaluation of image similarity metrics in medical imaging -- including the first large-scale comparative study of generative models for medical image translation -- and release an accessible codebase to facilitate future research. Our results are supported by thorough experiments spanning a variety of datasets, modalities, and downstream tasks, highlighting the broad potential of FRD for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Toward a Low-Cost Perception System in Autonomous Vehicles: A Spectrum Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a cost-effective new approach for generating denser depth maps for Autonomous Driving (AD) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by integrating the images obtained from deep neural network (DNN) 4D radar detectors with conventional camera RGB images. Our approach introduces a novel pixel positional encoding algorithm inspired by Bartlett's spatial spectrum estimation technique. This algorithm transforms both radar depth maps and RGB images into a unified pixel image subspace called the Spatial Spectrum, facilitating effective learning based on their similarities and differences. Our method effectively leverages high-resolution camera images to train radar depth map generative models, addressing the limitations of conventional radar detectors in complex vehicular environments, thus sharpening the radar output. We develop spectrum estimation algorithms tailored for radar depth maps and RGB images, a comprehensive training framework for data-driven generative models, and a camera-radar deployment scheme for AV operation. Our results demonstrate that our approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 27.95% in terms of Unidirectional Chamfer Distance (UCD).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to strong learning abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they have become mainstream methods for image super-resolution. However, there are big differences of different deep learning methods with different types. There is little literature to summarize relations and differences of different methods in image super-resolution. Thus, summarizing these literatures are important, according to loading capacity and execution speed of devices. This paper first introduces principles of CNNs in image super-resolution, then introduces CNNs based bicubic interpolation, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, transposed convolution, sub-pixel layer, meta up-sampling for image super-resolution to analyze differences and relations of different CNNs based interpolations and modules, and compare performance of these methods by experiments. Finally, this paper gives potential research points and drawbacks and summarizes the whole paper, which can facilitate developments of CNNs in image super-resolution.</description>
