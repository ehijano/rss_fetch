      <title>On an Inferential Semantics for Intuitionistic Sentential Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sandqvist's base-extension semantics (B-eS) for intuitionistic sentential logic grounds meaning relative to bases (rather than, say, models), which are arbitrary sets of permitted inferences over sentences. While his soundness proof is standard, his completeness proof, is quite unusual. It closely parallels a method introduced much earlier by Mints, who developed a resolution-based approach to intuitionistic logic using a systematic translation of formulas into sentential counterparts. In this short note, we highlight the connection between these two approaches and show that the soundness and completeness of B-eS follow directly from Mints' theorem. While the result is modest, it reinforces the relevance of proof-search to proof-theoretic semantics and suggests that resolution methods have a deeper conceptual role in constructive reasoning than is often acknowledged.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for Classical Propositional Logic with Assertion and Denial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) offers an alternative approach to meaning in logic that is based on inference and argument (rather than truth in a model). It has been successfully developed for various logics; in particular, Sandqvist has developed such semantics for both classical and intuitionistic logic. In the case of classical logic, P-tS provides a conception of consequence that avoids an \emph{a priori} commitment to the principle of bivalence, addressing what Dummett identified as a significant foundational challenge in logic. In this paper, we propose an alternative P-tS for classical logic, which essentially extends the P-tS for intuitionistic logic by operating over literals rather than atomic propositions. Importantly, literals are atomic and not defined by negation but are defined by inferential relationships. This semantics illustrates the perspective that classical logic can be understood as intuitionistic logic supplemented by a principle of duality, offering fresh insights into the relationship between these two systems.</description>

      <title>Borel versions of the Local Lemma and LOCAL algorithms for graphs of finite asymptotic separation index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic separation index is a parameter that measures how easily a Borel graph can be approximated by its subgraphs with finite components. In contrast to the more classical notion of hyperfiniteness, asymptotic separation index is well-suited for combinatorial applications in the Borel setting. The main result of this paper is a Borel version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma -- a powerful general-purpose tool in probabilistic combinatorics -- under a finite asymptotic separation index assumption. As a consequence, we show that locally checkable labeling problems that are solvable by efficient randomized distributed algorithms admit Borel solutions on bounded degree Borel graphs with finite asymptotic separation index. From this we derive a number of corollaries, for example a Borel version of Brooks's theorem for graphs with finite asymptotic separation index.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Querying First-Order Theories via Countermodels of Finite Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generic framework for establishing the decidability of a wide range of logical entailment problems (briefly called querying), based on the existence of countermodels that are structurally simple, gauged by certain types of width measures (with treewidth and cliquewidth as popular examples). As an important special case of our framework, we identify logics exhibiting width-finite finitely universal model sets, warranting decidable entailment for a wide range of homomorphism-closed queries, subsuming a diverse set of practically relevant query languages. As a particularly powerful width measure, we propose to employ Blumensath's partitionwidth, which subsumes various other commonly considered width measures and exhibits highly favorable computational and structural properties. Focusing on the formalism of existential rules as a popular showcase, we explain how finite partitionwidth sets of rules subsume other known abstract decidable classes but - leveraging existing notions of stratification - also cover a wide range of new rulesets. We expose natural limitations for fitting the class of finite unification sets into our picture and suggest several options for remedy.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations play a crucial role in balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling us to adjust decision granularity dynamically. Furthermore, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study employs CST in grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>
