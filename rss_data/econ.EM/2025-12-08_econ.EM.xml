      <title>A Note on the Finite Sample Bias in Time Series Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that model selection via cross validation can be biased for time series models. However, many researchers have argued that this bias does not apply when using cross-validation with vector autoregressions (VAR) or with time series models whose errors follow a martingale-like structure. I show that even under these circumstances, performing cross-validation on time series data will still generate bias in general.</description>

      <title>Marginal homogeneity tests with panel data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A panel dataset satisfies marginal homogeneity if the time-specific marginal distributions are homogeneous or time-invariant. Marginal homogeneity is relevant in many economic settings, including dynamic discrete games, difference-in-differences models, and finance. In this paper, we propose several tests for the hypothesis of marginal homogeneity and investigate their properties. We consider an asymptotic framework in which the number of individuals n in the panel diverges, while the number of periods T is fixed. We implement our tests by comparing a studentized or non-studentized T-sample version of the Cramer-von Mises statistic with a suitable critical value. We propose three methods for constructing the critical value: asymptotic approximations, the bootstrap, and time permutations. We show that the first two methods result in asymptotically exact hypothesis tests. The permutation test based on a non-studentized statistic is asymptotically exact when T=2, but is asymptotically invalid when T&gt;2. In contrast, the permutation test based on a studentized statistic is always asymptotically exact. Finally, under a time-exchangeability assumption, the permutation test is exact in finite samples, both with and without studentization.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models: An Applied Econometric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable researchers to analyze text at unprecedented scale and minimal cost. Researchers can now revisit old questions and tackle novel ones with rich data. We provide an econometric framework for realizing this potential in two empirical uses. For prediction problems -- forecasting outcomes from text -- valid conclusions require ``no training leakage'' between the LLM's training data and the researcher's sample, which can be enforced through careful model choice and research design. For estimation problems -- automating the measurement of economic concepts for downstream analysis -- valid downstream inference requires combining LLM outputs with a small validation sample to deliver consistent and precise estimates. Absent a validation sample, researchers cannot assess possible errors in LLM outputs, and consequently seemingly innocuous choices (which model, which prompt) can produce dramatically different parameter estimates. When used appropriately, LLMs are powerful tools that can expand the frontier of empirical economics.</description>

      <title>Prediction with Differential Covariate Classification: Illustrated by Covariate Classification in Medical Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common practice in evidence-based decision-making uses estimates of conditional probabilities P(y|x) obtained from research studies to predict outcomes y on the basis of observed covariates x. Given this information, decisions are then based on the predicted outcomes. Researchers commonly assume that the predictors used in the generation of the evidence are the same as those used in applying the evidence: i.e., the meaning of x in the two circumstances is the same. This may not be the case in real-world settings. Across a wide range of settings, ranging from clinical practice to education policy, demographic attributes (e.g., age, race, ethnicity) are often classified differently in research studies than in decision settings. This paper studies identification in such settings. We propose a formal framework for prediction with what we term differential covariate classification (DCC). Using this framework, we analyze partial identification of probabilistic predictions and assess how various assumptions influence the identification regions. We apply the findings to a range of settings, focusing mainly on differential classification of individuals' race and ethnicity in clinical medicine. We find that bounds on P(y|x) can be wide, and the information needed to narrow them available only in special cases. These findings highlight an important problem in using evidence in decision making, a problem that has not yet been fully appreciated in debates on classification in public policy and medicine.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Difference Representations of Moments: Gini and Generalized Lagrange identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide pairwise-difference (Gini-type) representations of higher-order central moments for both general random variables and empirical moments. Such representations do not require a measure of location. For third and fourth moments, this yields pairwise-difference representations of skewness and kurtosis coefficients. We show that all central moments possess such representations, so no reference to the mean is needed for moments of any order. This is done by considering i.i.d. replications of the random variables considered, by observing that central moments can be interpreted as covariances between a random variable and powers of the same variable, and by giving recursions which link the pairwise-difference representation of any moment to lower order ones. Numerical summation identities are deduced. Through a similar approach, we give analogues of the Lagrange and Binet-Cauchy identities for general random variables, along with a simple derivation of the classic Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for covariances. Finally, an application to unbiased estimation of centered moments is discussed.</description>
