      <title>Directed univalence in simplicial homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory extends homotopy type theory with a directed path type which internalizes the notion of a homomorphism within a type. This concept has significant applications both within mathematics -- where it allows for synthetic (higher) category theory -- and programming languages -- where it leads to a directed version of the structure identity principle. In this work, we construct the first types in simplicial type theory with non-trivial homomorphisms. We extend simplicial type theory with modalities and new reasoning principles to obtain triangulated type theory in order to construct the universe of discrete types $\mathcal{S}$. We prove that homomorphisms in this type correspond to ordinary functions of types i.e., that $\mathcal{S}$ is directed univalent. The construction of $\mathcal{S}$ is foundational for both of the aforementioned applications of simplicial type theory. We are able to define several crucial examples of categories and to recover important results from category theory. Using $\mathcal{S}$, we are also able to define various types whose usage is guaranteed to be functorial. These provide the first complete examples of the proposed directed structure identity principle.</description>

      <title>Amplitudes in persistence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.09036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of persistent homology in applications is justified by the validity of certain stability results. At the core of such results is a notion of distance between the invariants that one associates with data sets. Here we introduce a general framework to compare distances and invariants in multiparameter persistence, where there is no natural choice of invariants and distances between them. We define amplitudes, monotone, and subadditive invariants that arise from assigning a non-negative real number to objects of an abelian category. We then present different ways to associate distances to such invariants, and we provide a classification of classes of amplitudes relevant to topological data analysis. In addition, we study the the relationships as well as the discriminitative power of such amplitude distances arising in topological data analysis scenarios.</description>

      <title>On fusing matrices associated with conformal boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look at the fusing matrices that arise when a topological defect is attached to a conformal boundary condition. We call such junctions open topological defects. One type of fusing matrices arises when two open defects fuse while another arises when an open defect passes through a boundary operator. We use the topological field theory approach to RCFTs based on Frobenius algebra objects in modular tensor categories to describe the general structure associated with such matrices and how to compute them from a given Frobenius algebra object and its representation theory. We illustrate the computational process on the rational free boson theories. Applications to boundary renormalisation group flows are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The Hopf category of Frobenius algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the universal measuring coalgebras between Frobenius algebras turn the category of Frobenius algebras into a Hopf category (in the sense of Batista-Caenepeel-Vercruysse), and the universal comeasuring algebras between Frobenius algebras turn the category Frobenius algebras into a Hopf opcategory. We also discuss duality and compatibility results between these structures.
  Our theory vastly generalizes the well-known fact that any homomorphism beween Frobenius algebras is an isomorphism, but also allows to go beyond classical (iso)morphisms between Frobenius algebras, especially in finite characteristic, as we show by some explicit examples. The paper is concluded with some open questions and considerations about Topological Quantum Field Theories.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic sets as a model of homotopy types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diagrammatic sets are presheaves on a rich category of shapes, whose definition is motivated by combinatorial topology and higher-dimensional diagram rewriting. These shapes include representatives of oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes, and are stable under operations including Gray products, joins, suspensions, and duals. We exhibit a cofibrantly generated model structure on diagrammatic sets, as well as two separate Quillen equivalences with the classical model structure on simplicial sets. We construct explicit sets of generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations, and prove that the model structure is monoidal with the Gray product of diagrammatic sets.</description>
