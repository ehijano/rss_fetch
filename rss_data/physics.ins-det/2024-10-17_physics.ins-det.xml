      <title>Measurements of the Quantum Yield of Silicon using Geiger-mode Avalanching Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of quantum yield is crucial to the reconstruction of energy depositions in silicon at the eV scale. This work presents a new method for experimentally calculating quantum yield using vacuum UV-sensitive silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), which can be used to determine the probabilities that a UV photon absorbed in a silicon crystal will produce one, two, or three electron-hole pairs. Results are presented which fully constrain the distribution at photon energies up to 7.75eV. This method works by exploiting the saturation of photon detection efficiency which occurs when these devices are biased sufficiently high above their avalanche breakdown voltage. The measured quantum yield values are lower than those that have been previously reported by experimental data and modelling -- this is expected to impact the sensitivity of experiments searching for light dark matter through direct detection in semiconductors, and should also be taken into account when characterizing the performance of UV photodetectors with high quantum efficiency. Measurements have been taken using a Hamamatsu VUV4 and an FBK VUV-HD3 device, showing good agreements between devices, and at a range of temperatures from 163-233K. The validity of the method is assessed using supplementary measurements of absolute photon detection efficiency, and an additional novel method of measuring average quantum yield using DC current-voltage measurements of SiPMs is presented and used for corroboration.</description>

      <title>Picometer-level quadrangle optical bonding bench for testing interferometric technologies in TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric techniques are crucial for space-based gravitational wave detection, requiring a picometer-level stable optical bench, precise phasemeter, interstellar transponder low-light phase locking, and laser sideband communication. These technologies must be rigorously tested on the ground before deployment in space. The AEI group has previously developed a picometer-stable hexapod optical bench to verify the linearity and precision of phase extraction for LISA. In this paper, we introduce a quadrangle quasi-monolithic optical bench aimed at simplifying the system and expanding the range of tested interferometric techniques for TianQin. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves picometer-level optical pathlength stability and phase resolution over a large dynamic range. In the laser transponder link test, the light phase-locked residual noise is lower than ${\rm 10^{-4}\,rad/Hz^{1/2}}$ above millihertz frequency range, and the laser sideband modulation has no significant coupling to the measurements in the ${\rm mHz-Hz}$ band. These results provide critical technical validation for the implementation of future gravitational wave detection in space.</description>

      <title>The ESRF dark-field x-ray microscope at ID03</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a full-field imaging technique for non-destructive 3D mapping of orientation and strain in crystalline elements. The new DFXM beamline at ID03, developed as part of the ESRF Phase II Upgrade Project (EBSL2), was designed to provide cutting-edge capabilities for studying embedded microstructures. The project relocated and upgraded the end station from ID06-HXM to ID03, integrating new X-ray optics, radiation hutches, and a source device optimized for this advanced technique. Notable improvements include a near-field camera, a new goniometer, and a high-resolution far-field camera. The conceptual design was completed in September 2019, followed by the technical design in March 2021, with first users welcomed in April 2024. Building on the success of the original instrument, the ID03 beamline offers enhanced multi-scale and multi-modal mapping of microstructures with high resolution, enabling in-situ exploration of complex phenomena. Applications range from strain and orientation mapping in metals to studies of functional materials, semiconductors, biominerals, and energy systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Simulation and Correlated Low-Frequency Noise Subtraction for an In-Orbit Demonstrator of Magnetic Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, nanosatellites have revolutionized the space sector due to their significant economic and time-saving advantages. As a result, they have fostered the testing of advanced instruments intended for larger space science missions. The case of MELISA is presented in this work. MELISA is a magnetic measurement instrument which aims at demonstrating the in-orbit performance of AMR sensors featuring dedicated noise reduction techniques at sub-millihertz frequencies. Such low frequency ranges are relevant for future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, where the local magnetic environment of the satellite might yield a significant contribution to the overall noise budget of the observatory. The demanding magnetic noise levels required for this bandwidth, down to 0.1 mHz, make measurements arduous. To explore sensing solutions within the H2020 European Commission Programme with the involvement of ESA, the functional performance of MELISA-III will be validated in-orbit. During operations, there is the possibility to measure the low-frequency magnetic contribution stemming from orbiting the Earth's magnetic field, impeding the characterization of the intrinsic performance of the sensor. With the objective of minimizing excess noise during the in-flight operations, the present research aims to simulate the environmental magnetic conditions in LEO to identify and subtract undesired contributions to the measurements. The in-orbit long-term magnetic fluctuations are replicated using a Helmholtz coil system. A fluxgate magnetometer allows the correlation of the generated field with the payload measurements, leading to the subsequent subtraction. Proving the effect of this approach will facilitate the noise characterization of magnetic sensors in LEO, paving the way for the in-orbit validation of MELISA-III for use in magnetically demanding missions with long integration times.</description>

      <title>QuSpin Zero-Field Magnetometer Characterization for the TUCAN Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TUCAN nEDM experiment characterizes the QuSpin Zero-Field Magnetometer (QZFM) to accurately map residual fields within a large magnetically shielded room. The magnetometer's intrinsic offset was measured to be within 3 nT and stable over a period of one year. The response was shown to be within 2 percent of linearity in the zero-field regime, up to 2 nTpp, and then follows a smooth dispersion curve. Crosstalk effects induced by multisensor operation were determined to have a small effect, and inconsequential with a separation above 6 cm. These results enable the QZFM for accurate measurement of DC fields, increase the operational range of QZFM by a factor of more than an order of magnitude, and allow for higher efficiency and flexibility by green-lighting simultaneous operation of multiple QZFMs.</description>

      <title>The CuboDAQ Data Acquisition System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CuboDAQ is a custom data acquisition system to read out SiPM-based detectors. It features electronic boards to digitize the SiPMs signal, an FPGA-based system-on-module board, the connectivity to transmit the data to a central server, and all the software necessary to operate them. The front-end is based on the TOFPET2 ASIC, produced by PETsys, connected to a custom board, featuring an Enclustra Mercury SA1 module with a Cyclone~V FPGA. Multiple boards can be operated synchronously by distributing the clock and synchronous reset signals from a central source. The system features a complete software framework to calibrate and monitor the detectors, to acquire and process data and to perform track reconstruction. The CuboDAQ system performance has been evaluated in different scenarios and can cope with sustained rates of above $4\cdot 10^6$ hits/s, with peaks of more than $7\cdot 10^6$ hits/s. This system has been employed for the readout of the SND@LHC detector at CERN, a testbeam telescope and lab setups.</description>

      <title>Initial Results From the First Field Expedition of UAPx to Study Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In July 2021, faculty from the UAlbany Department of Physics participated in a week-long field expedition with the organization UAPx to collect data on UAPs in Avalon, California, located on Catalina Island, and nearby. This paper reviews both the hardware and software techniques which this collaboration employed, and contains a frank discussion of the successes and failures, with a section about how to apply lessons learned to future expeditions. Both observable-light and infrared cameras were deployed, as well as sensors for other (non-EM) emissions. A pixel-subtraction method was augmented with other similarly simple methods to provide initial identification of objects in the sky and/or the sea crossing the cameras' fields of view. The first results will be presented based upon approximately one hour in total of triggered visible/night-vision-mode video and over 600 hours of un-triggered (far) IR video recorded, as well as 55 hours of (background) radiation measurements. Following multiple explanatory resolutions of several ambiguities that were potentially anomalous at first, we focus on the primary remaining ambiguity captured at approximately 4am Pacific Time on Friday, July 16: a dark spot in the visible/near-IR camera possibly coincident with ionizing radiation that has so far resisted prosaic explanation. We conclude with quantitative suggestions (3-5 sigma rules) for serious researchers in the still-maligned field of hard-science-based UAP studies, with an ultimate goal of identifying UAPs without confirmation bias toward mundane / speculative conclusions.</description>

      <title>Squeezing the quantum noise of a gravitational-wave detector below the standard quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>
