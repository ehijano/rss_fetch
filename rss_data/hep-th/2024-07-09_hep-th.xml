      <title>A new observable for holographic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double-cone geometry is a saddle of the gravitational path integral, which explains the chaotic statistics of the spectrum of black hole microstates. This geometry is the usual AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, but with a periodic identification of the time coordinate; the resulting singularity at the black hole horizon is regulated by making the geometry slightly complex. Here, we consider generalizations of the double-cone geometry which include the Lorentzian cosmology that sits between the event horizon and the black hole singularity. We analyze this in two and three dimensions, where the cosmology has compact spatial sections and big bang/crunch singularities. These singularities are regulated in the same way by slightly complexifying the metric. We show that this is possible while satisfying the Kontsevich-Segal criterion, implying that these geometries can be interpreted as perturbatively stable saddle points in general relativity. This procedure leads to a novel description of the cosmology in terms of standard observables in the dual boundary CFT. In three dimensions, the cosmological solution gives a new contribution to the two-point function of the density of states in the boundary CFT. Unlike the usual double cone, it describes correlations between black hole microstates with different masses, and in a limit describes correlations between the statistics of heavy states and states near the BTZ threshold.</description>

      <title>Differential Equations for Carrollian Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations are powerful tools in the study of correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs). Carrollian amplitudes behave as correlation functions of Carrollian CFT that holographically describes asymptotically flat spacetime. We derive linear differential equations satisfied by Carrollian MHV gluon and graviton amplitudes. We obtain non-distributional solutions for both the gluon and graviton cases. We perform various consistency checks for these differential equations, including compatibility with conformal Carrollian symmetries.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric polynomials and algebro-combinatorial duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of topological charged dilatonic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to explore the thermodynamic topology of topological charged dilatonic black holes. To achieve this, our study will begin by examining the characteristics of topological charged black holes in dilaton gravity. Specifically, we will concentrate on the impact of the topological constant on the event horizon of these black holes. Subsequently, we will analyze these black holes, considering their thermodynamic and conserved quantities, in order to assess the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. We explore the thermodynamic topology of these black holes by treating them as thermodynamic defects. For our study, we examine two types of thermodynamic ensembles: the fixed $q$ ensemble and the fixed $\phi$ ensemble. To study the impact of the topological constant ($% k$) on thermodynamic topology, we consider all possible types of curvature hypersurfaces that can form in these black holes. By calculating the topological charges at the defects within their thermodynamic spaces, we analyze both the local and global topology of these black holes. We also investigate how the parameters of dilaton gravity affect the thermodynamic topology of black holes and highlight the differences compared to charged black holes in the General Relativity.</description>

      <title>A Supersymmetric Extension of $w_{1+\infty}$ Algebra in the Celestial Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric topological $W_{\infty} $ algebra by using the $\lambda $ deformed bosons $(\beta,\gamma)$ and fermions $(b,c)$ ghost system. By considering the real bosons and the real fermions at $\lambda=0$ (or $\lambda=\frac{1}{2}$), the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $W_{\frac{\infty}{2}}$ algebra is obtained. At $\lambda=\frac{1}{4}$, other ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $W_{1+\infty}[\lambda=\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra is determined. We also obtain the extension of Lie superalgebra $PSU(2,2|{\cal N}=4)$ appearing in the worldsheet theory by using the symplectic bosons and the fermions. We identify the soft current algebra between the graviton, the gravitino, the photon (the gluon), the photino (the gluino) or the scalars, equivalent to ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $W_{1+\infty}[\lambda]$ algebra, in two dimensions with the ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity theory in four dimensions discovered by Freedman, van Nieuwenhuizen and Ferrara in 1976 and its matter coupled theories, via celestial holography.</description>

      <title>Positivity properties of scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate positivity properties in quantum field theory (QFT). We find that planar Feynman integrals in QFT, as well as many related quantities, satisfy an infinite number of positivity conditions: the functions, as well as all their signed derivatives, are non-negative in a specified kinematic region. Such functions are known as completely monotonic (CM) in the mathematics literature. A powerful way to certify complete monotonicity is via integral representations. We thus show that it applies to non-planar integrals possessing a Euclidean region, to cosmological correlators, as well as to certain stringy integrals. Motivated by Positive Geometry, we investigate positivity properties in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We present evidence, based on known analytic multi-loop results, that the CM property extends to several physical quantities in this theory. This includes the (suitably normalized) finite remainder function of the six-particle maximally-helicity violating (MHV) amplitude, four-point scattering amplitudes on the Coulomb branch, four-point correlation functions, as well as the angle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension. Our findings are however not limited to supersymmetric theories. It is shown that the CM property holds for the QCD and QED cusp anomalous dimensions, to three and four loops, respectively. We comment on open questions, and on possible numerical applications of complete monotonicity.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry of Particle mixing theories and the equation of motion matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-Hermitian complex scalar field model is considered from its $\mc{PT}$ symmetric aspect. A matrix constructed from the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion is utilized to analyze the states of the model. The model has two mass terms which determine the real or complex nature of the eigen values. A mismatch is found in the Lagrange equations of motion of the fields as the equations do not agree with the other after complex conjugation of the either. This is resolved by exploiting a preferred similarity transformation of the Lagrangian. The discrepancy even at the Hamiltonian level is found to have vanished once we consider the similarity transformed Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Cubic interactions for massless and partially massless spin-1 and spin-2 fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a complete classification of the consistent two-derivative cubic couplings for a system containing an arbitrary number of massless spin-1, massless spin-2, and partially massless (PM) spin-2 fields in $D$-dimensional (anti-)de Sitter space. In addition to previously known results, we find a unique candidate mixing between spin-1 and PM spin-2 fields. We derive all the quadratic constraints on the structure constants of the theory, allowing for relative ``wrong-sign'' kinetic terms for any of the fields. In the particular case when the kinetic terms in each sector have no relative signs, we find that the unique consistent non-trivial theory is given by multiple independent copies of conformal gravity coupled to a Yang-Mills sector in $D=4$. Our results strengthen the well-known no-go theorems on the absence of mutual interactions for massless and PM spin-2 fields.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Carrollian fluids I: Carroll-Galilei duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galilean and Carrollian algebras acting on two-dimensional Newton-Cartan and Carrollian manifolds are isomorphic. A consequence of this property is a duality correspondence between one-dimensional Galilean and Carrollian fluids. We describe the dynamics of these systems as they emerge from the relevant limits of Lorentzian hydrodynamics, and explore the advertised duality relationship. This interchanges longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the flow velocity, and permutes equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium observables, unveiling specific features of Carrollian physics. We investigate the action of local hydrodynamic-frame transformations in the Galilean and Carrollian configurations, i.e. dual Galilean and Carrollian local boosts, and comment on their potential breaking. Emphasis is laid on the additional geometric elements that are necessary to attain complete systems of hydrodynamic equations in Newton-Cartan and Carroll spacetimes. Our analysis is conducted in general Cartan frames as well as in more explicit coordinates, specifically suited to Galilean or Carrollian use.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic expansion of open strings and D-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand the relativistic open bosonic string in powers of $1/c^2$ where $c$ is the speed of light. We perform this expansion to next-to-leading order in $1/c^2$ and relate our results to known descriptions of non-relativistic open strings obtained by taking limits. Just as for closed strings the non-relativistic expansion is well-defined if the open string winds a circle in the target space. This direction must satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions. It is shown that the endpoints of the open string behave as Bargmann particles in the non-relativistic regime. These open strings end on nrD$p$-branes with $p\le 24$. When these nrD$p$-branes do not fluctuate they correspond to $(p+1)$-dimensional Newton--Cartan submanifolds of the target space. When we include fluctuations and worldvolume gauge fields their dynamics is described by a non-relativistic version of the DBI action whose form we derive from symmetry considerations. The worldvolume gauge field and scalar field of a nrD$24$-brane make up the field content of Galilean electrodynamics (GED), and the effective theory on the nrD$24$-brane is precisely a non-linear version of GED. We generalise these results to actions for any nrD$p$-brane by demanding that they have the same target space gauge symmetries that the non-relativistic open and closed string actions have. Finally, we show that the nrD$p$-brane action is transverse T-duality covariant. Our results agree with the findings of Gomis, Yan and Yu in arXiv:2007.01886.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric Potential Inflation and Swampland Program in Rescaled Gravity with Stringy Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by string theory activities, we investigate inflationary models and the swampland criteria in the context of a stringy rescaled gravity.
  Inspired by differential equations associated with special functions, we develop an algorithm to derive new scalar potential functions with hypergeometric behaviors from string theory correction terms. Among others, we obtain a family of models indexed by a couple $(m,n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers constrained by hypergeometric behaviors and certain physical requirements. Using the falsification scenario, we confront the derived models with the Planck observational data for such a stringy rescaled gravity. Then, we approach the associated swampland conjectures. For certain models of phenomenological interest, we find that the swampland criteria are satisfied for small values of the slow-roll parameters in such a modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Exact Diffeomorphism in Warped Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the manifestation of exact diffeomorphism in warped extra dimension, with an emphasis on the Randall-Sundrum model. Utilizing the covariant form of variation $\delta g_{MN} = \nabla_M \xi_N + \nabla_N \xi_M$, we derive the nonlinear transformation rules for the metric fields in the unitary gauge. As an off-shell symmetry, diffeomorphism governs the interaction structure by connecting the neighboring orders of bulk action expansions. Our analysis unveils that an on-shell diffeomorphism exists prior to radion stabilization, but is broken by the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. This on-shell symmetry enforces a mass-related equation $F'- A' G =0$ to eliminate one degree of freedom, while ensuring the 5D action invariant up to a surface term. Therefore, we conjecture that the on-shell diffeomorphism actually protects the radion field from acquiring mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of stability and pseudospectra of complex momentum modes of asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes. Similar to quasinormal modes, these can be defined as the poles of the holographic Green's function, albeit for real frequency and complex momentum. Their pseudospectra are in stark contrast to the pseudospectra of quasinormal modes of AdS black holes. Contrary to the case of quasinormal mode pseudospectra, the resolvent is well-defined, and the numerical approximation shows fast convergence. At zero frequency, complex momentum modes are stable normal modes of a Hermitian operator. Even for large frequencies, they show only comparatively mild spectral instability. We also find that local potential perturbations cannot destabilize the lowest complex momentum mode.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider open $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ spin chain, mainly the simplest case of one particle. Eigenfunctions of the model can be constructed using the so-called reflection operator. We obtain several representations of this operator and show its relation to the hypergeometric function. Besides, we prove orthogonality and completeness of one-particle eigenfunctions and connect them to the index hypergeometric transform. Finally, we briefly state the formula for the eigenfunctions in many-particle case.</description>

      <title>Loop Quantum Gravity and CMB Anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent satellite observations have revealed significant anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, a phenomenon that had previously been detected but received limited attention due to its subtlety. With the advent of more precise measurements from satellites, the extent of this anisotropy has become increasingly apparent. This paper examines the CMB radiation by reviewing past research on the causes of CMB anisotropy and presents a new model to explain the observed temperature anisotropy and the anisotropy in the correlation function between temperature and E-mode polarization in the CMB radiation. The proposed model is based on a modified-generalized Compton scattering approach incorporating Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We begin by describing the generalized Compton scattering and then discuss the CMB radiation in the context of processes occurring at the last scattering surface. Our findings are derived from the latest observational data from the Planck satellite (2018). In our model, besides the parameters available in the Planck data for the standard model ($\Lambda$CDM), we introduce two novel parameters: $\delta_{L}$, the density of cosmic electrons, and $M^2$, a parameter related to the modified-generalized Compton scattering effects. The results indicate that, based on the 2018 Planck data, small values were obtained for $\delta_{L}$ and $M^{2}$, $\delta_{L}=1.63\pm0.08(10^{-13})$ and $M^2=2.28\pm0.34(10^{-4})$), showing no significant deviation from the standard model. Moreover, increasing the values of $\delta_{L}$ and $M^{2}$ leads to an increase in the range of fluctuations in the CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum and the correlation function between temperature and E-mode polarization for multipoles $l&lt;500$ until the first peak.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic strings that are attached to rapidly spinning black holes can extract significant amounts of rotational energy and angular momentum. Here we study the effect on primordial black holes, which are expected to form with one or more cosmic strings attached. Although large primordial black holes are predicted to rapidly spin up due to accretion soon after forming, we argue that cosmic strings will spin them down again. As a result, the spins of primordial black holes should consequently be observed to be near zero. We also investigate the effect on a supermassive black hole of capturing a cosmic string and the possibility of observing the subsequent spin down by its effect on a pulsar orbiting the black hole.</description>

      <title>Violation of Causality in $f(Q)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is ongoing interest in the nonmetricity formulation of gravity. The nonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been proposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing challenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have already been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for astrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\"odel-type spacetimes, we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits cosmological solutions that violate causality. We find that G\"odel-type metrics do not appear to be compatible with this modified gravity theory unless it reduces to the trivial case of symmetric teleparallel gravity, corresponding to $f(Q)=AQ+B$, which is equivalent to general relativity. For $f(Q)$ more general than linear, the theory seems endowed with some chronology protection mechanism that shields it from G\"odel-like causality violations.</description>

      <title>On Hamiltonian formulations of the Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a previously successful discussion of the constrained Schr\"{o}dinger system through the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm to the case of the Dirac field. In order to follow the analogy, first we discuss the classical Dirac field as a spinorial variable, by introducing properly defined momenta and a suitably modified, factor ordered Poisson bracket. According to the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm two second class Hamiltonian constraints emerge, leading to a factor ordered Dirac bracket on the full phase space. This becomes the Poisson bracket on the reduced phase space in the canonical chart adapted to the shell. The Dirac equation is recovered both as consistency condition on the full phase space and as canonical equation on the reduced phase space. Alternatively, considering the Dirac field as odd Grassmann variable, we present the details of the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm (with either left and righ derivatives acting on Grassmann valued superfunctions and involving a different type of generalized Poisson and Dirac brackets). We propose a recipe for the canonical second quantization of all three versions of the generalized Dirac brackets, yielding the correct fundamental anticommutator.</description>

      <title>Signatures of supermassive charged gravitinos in liquid scintillator detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work two of the present authors have suggested possible experimental ways to search for stable supermassive particles with electric charges of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in upcoming underground experiments and the new JUNO observatory in particular [K.A. Meissner and H. Nicolai, Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf 84}, 269 (2024)]. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the specific signature of such gravitino-induced events for the JUNO detector. The proposed method of detection relies on the `glow' produced by photons during the passage of such particles through the detector liquid, which would last for about a few to a few hundred microseconds depending on its velocity and the track. The cross sections for electronic excitation of the main component of the scintillator liquid, namely linear alkylbenzene (LAB), by the passing gravitino, are evaluated using quantum-chemical methods. The results show that, if such particles exist, the resulting signals would lead to a unique and unmistakable signature, for which we present event simulations as they would be seen by the JUNO photomultipliers. Our analysis brings together two very different research areas, namely fundamental particles physics and the search for a fundamental theory on the one hand, and methods of advanced quantum chemistry on the other.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints in symmetric teleparallel gravity with bulk viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of modified $f(Q)$ gravity. The investigation focus on the role of bulk viscosity in understanding the universe's accelerated expansion. Specifically, a bulk viscous matter-dominated cosmological model is considered, with the bulk viscosity coefficient expressed as $\zeta= \zeta_0 \rho H^{-1} + \zeta_1 H $. We consider the power law $f(Q)$ function $f(Q)=\alpha Q^n $, where $\alpha$ and $n$ are arbitrary constants and derive the analytical solutions for the field equations corresponding to a flat FLRW metric. Subsequently, we used the combined Cosmic Chronometers (CC)+Pantheon+SH0ES sample to estimate the free parameters of the obtained analytic solution. We conduct Bayesian statistical analysis to estimate the posterior probability by employing the likelihood function and the MCMC random sampling technique, along with the AIC and BIC statistical assessment criteria. In addition, we explore the evolutionary behavior of significant cosmological parameters. The effective equation of state (EOS) parameter predicts the accelerating behavior of the cosmic expansion phase. Further, by the statefinder and $Om(z)$ diagnostic test, we found that our viscous model favors quintessence-type behavior and can successfully describe the late-time scenario.</description>

      <title>QCD Masterclass Lectures on Jet Physics and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures were presented at the 2024 QCD Masterclass in Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, France. They introduce and review fundamental theorems and principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle physics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination. Numerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in detail, including $H\to b\bar b$ identification in fixed-order perturbation theory, generic one- versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power counting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming the central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment expansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet discrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive, infrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to including measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented here are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being a parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon discrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are simultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.</description>

      <title>Representation-Theoretical Characterization of Canonical Custodial Symmetry in NHDM Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering the basis-covariant constituents of N-Higgs-doublet potentials, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for canonical SO(4)_C Custodial Symmetry (CS) of potentials with N&gt;2 doublets, based on representation-theoretical and geometrical relations. In essence, our characterization relates the presence of canonical CS to basis-covariant vectors corresponding to particular bases of the defining representation of the orthogonal Lie algebras. For N=3,4 and 5, the conditions demand little computational effort to be evaluated, and we provide practical algorithms that may be efficiently implemented in a computer program, for deciding whether or not a potential is custodial-symmetric.</description>

      <title>Precise correspondence between the p-wave chiral superfluid and the spinless bosonic superfluid on the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a precise formal correspondence between a spinless p-wave chiral fermionic superfluid and a spinless bosonic superfluid in a strong magnetic field by accounting for the correct superfluid vorticity in the effective theory of the former. In literature, the vorticity manifests itself incompletely as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution can be understood as a truncation in the relevant expansion scheme, together with field redefinitions. Those discarded components are critical to restoring the Berry phase term in the effective theory, and the restoration incapsulates these two systems in the same master Lagrangian. In addition to clarifying the structure of the Berry phase, this formalism permits solving the bosonic system on the lowest Landau level (LLL) based on the method of analogue. In particular, we show that in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing these systems are identical by reformulating the vortex crystal with an auxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified view for these systems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants, and physically interpretable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational field and lensing of a circular chiral vorton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images of the back side of the ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is considered in the context of Generalized Electrodynamics (GE) by Podolsky and Bopp. GE is the only extension to Maxwell electrodynamics that is locally {\normalsize{}U(1)}-gauge invariant, admits linear field equations and contains higher-order derivatives of the vector potential. GE admits both massless and massive modes for the photon. We recover the ordinary quantum phase shift of the AB effect, derived in the context of Maxwell electrodynamics, for the massless mode of the photon in GE. The massive mode induces a correction factor to the AB phase shift depending on the photon mass. We study both the magnetic AB effect and its electric counterpart. In principle, accurate experimental observations of AB the phase shift could be used to constrain GE photon mass.</description>

      <title>Can the induced increase in the angular velocity prevent the overspinning of BTZ black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously we showed that nearly extremal Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black holes can be overspun by test bodies and fields, following the work of Rocha and Cardoso for the extremal case. The naked singularities in AdS space-times correspond to states rotating faster than light in the Ads/CFT correspondence. Therefore, overspinning turns out to be a drastic problem in a (2+1) dimensional AdS space-time, where one cannot invoke backreaction effects. Here, we consider the induced increase in the angular velocity of the event horizon which modifies the condition to allow the absorption of the perturbations satisfying the null energy condition. We show that its magnitude is sufficiently large to prevent the absorption of the challenging modes both for test bodies and scalar fields. We bring a solution to the notorious overspinning problem which does not involve any reference to self-energy or gravitational radiation.</description>

Abstract: In this work we discuss the neutrino phenomenology in a $\Delta(54)$ discrete flavor symmetry and evaluate the relic abundance of dark matter (DM) and active neutrino-DM mixing angle considering various cosmological constraints. We introduced two Standard Model Higgs particles along with vector-like fermions and a new particle (S) which is a gauge singlet in the Standard Model. This modification leads to a mass matrix that diverges from the tribimaximal neutrino mixing pattern resulting in a non-zero reactor angle ($\theta_{13}$). We also incorporated a $ Z_2 \otimes Z_3 \otimes Z_4$ symmetry for the specific interactions in our model. The additional particle S is a sterile neutrino which is considered to be a probable dark matter candidate with mass in keV range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves in horizon cosmology and constraints on entropic parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hallmark of the 4-parameter generalized entropy is that it can represent various known entropies proposed so far for suitable limits of the parameters, and thus the 4-parameter generalized entropy can be applied on additive as well as on non-additive systems. Thereafter the proposal of the generalized entropy, it becomes important to constrain the corresponding parameters. In the present work, we intend to do this from the perspective of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated during inflation. In the background level, the generalized entropy successfully drives a viable and smooth evolution of the universe, particularly from inflation to reheating followed by a radiation era, for certain ranges of the entropic parameters. Consequently we investigate whether such viable ranges of the entropic parameters (coming from the background level) allow the primordial GWs spectrum to pass through the sensitivity curves of various GWs observatories. Therefore, if the future observatories can detect the signal of primordial GWs, then our theoretical expectation carried in the present work may provide a possible tool for the measurement of the generalized entropic parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carrollian fluid equations arise from the equations for relativistic fluids in the limit as the speed of light vanishes, and have recently experienced a surge of interest in the theoretical physics community in the context of asymptotic symmetries and flat-space holography. In this paper we initiate the rigorous systematic analysis of these equations by studying them in one space dimension in the $C^1$ setting. We begin by proposing a notion of isentropic Carrollian equations, and use this to reduce the Carrollian equations to a $2 \times 2$ system of conservation laws. Using the scheme of Lax, we then classify when $C^1$ solutions to the isentropic Carrollian equations exist globally, or blow up in finite time. Our analysis assumes a Carrollian analogue of a constitutive relation for the Carrollian energy density, with exponent in the range $\gamma \in (1,3]$.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional Carrollian Fluids III: Global Existence and Weak Continuity in $L^\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carrollian fluid equations arise as the $c \to 0$ limit of the relativistic fluid equations and have recently experienced a surge of activity in the flat-space holography community. However, the rigorous mathematical well-posedness theory for these equations does not appear to have been previously studied. This paper is the third in a series in which we initiate the systematic analysis of the Carrollian fluid equations. In the present work we prove the global-in-time existence of bounded entropy solutions to the isentropic Carrollian fluid equations in one spatial dimension for a particular constitutive law ($\gamma = 3$). Our method is to use a vanishing viscosity approximation for which we establish a compensated compactness framework. Using this framework we also prove the compactness of entropy solutions in $L^\infty$, and establish a kinetic formulation of the problem. This global existence result in $L^\infty$ extends the $C^1$ theory presented in our companion paper ``One-Dimensional Carrollian Fluids II: $C^1$ Blow-up Criteria''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the recent gravitational analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for a classical system, namely a complex scalar field. We use this example to demonstrate that the Aharonov-Bohm effect in principle has nothing to do with quantum-mechanics. We then discuss how this classical field description can be connected to the standard one particle quantum description of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>Optical reflection signature of an axion dielectric with magnetic current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the reflection properties on the interface between an ordinary dielectric medium and a dielectric supporting a magnetic current (equivalent to a dielectric governed by axion electrodynamics). Considering the usual Maxwell equations and constitutive relations, we derive the general Fresnel coefficients for reflection for an incident wave with $s$ and $p$ polarization, assuming an isotropic magnetic current on a dielectric substrate. We determine all total internal reflection and critical angles (Brewster angles) conditions, which are given by strict relations between all relevant electromagnetic quantities of the system and the frequency. For $s$- and $p$-polarized incident waves, total internal reflection can occur under certain conditions on the constitutive parameters (for each propagating mode) at specific frequency windows and certain incidence angle intervals. All possible conditions to define critical angles for null reflection are determined. This scenario allows polarization changes by reflection. Considering a $p$-polarized incident wave, the frequency and the Brewster angle, allowing null reflection for both propagating modes, are determined. The Goos-H\"anchen shift and the complex Kerr rotation are also evaluated. The Kerr ellipticity angle presents a frequency-dependent behavior, also reported in Weyl semimetals, having maximum values $\eta_{Kerr}=\pm \pi/4$ for specific values of frequency, which may work as a signature of this axion chiral dielectric.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Ultraviolet Tail of the Primordial Gravitational Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) with wave numbers larger than the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation are originated from the ultraviolet (UV) modes, which are never stretched out of the horizon. Such a UV tail of the PGW energy spectrum has a spurious logarithmic divergence. We study the origin of such a divergence, and find that it comes from the instantaneous inflation-to-post-inflation transition, which can be removed by considering a finite duration. For the first time, we obtain a semi-analytical expression for the PGW energy spectrum. We find that the UV tail decays exponentially, while the decay rate depends solely on the transition rate. When there is a stiff post-inflationary stage, the enhanced PGW displays a characteristic spectral shape of power-law increasing and exponential decaying. We propose a fitting formula which can be used for signal searching.</description>

Abstract: We present a classification of asymptotically flat, supersymmetric black hole and soliton solutions of five-dimensional minimal supergravity that admit a single axial symmetry which `commutes' with the supersymmetry. This includes the first examples of five-dimensional black hole solutions with exactly one axial Killing field that are smooth on and outside the horizon. The solutions have similar properties to the previously studied class with biaxial symmetry, in particular, they have a Gibbons-Hawking base and the harmonic functions must be of multi-centred type with the centres corresponding to the connected components of the horizon or fixed points of the axial symmetry. We find a large moduli space of black hole and soliton spacetimes with non-contractible 2-cycles and the horizon topologies are $S^3$, $S^1\times S^2$ and lens spaces $L(p,1)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that for one sign of the deformation coupling single-trace $T{\bar T}$ deformation moves the holographic screen in G\"{o}del universe radially inward. For the other sign of the coupling it moves the holographic screen radially outward. We (thus) argue, on general grounds, that in holography (single-trace) $T{\bar T}$ deformation can be generally thought of as either moving the holographic boundary into the bulk or washing it away to infinity. In Anti-de Sitter this breaks the spacetime conformal symmetry. We further note that moving timelike holographic boundary into bulk creates a curvature singularity. In the boundary the singularity is understood by states with imaginary energies. To make the theory sensible we introduce an ultraviolet cutoff and thereby move the boundary into the bulk. In this paper we first obtain the Penrose limit of the single-trace $T{\bar T}$ deformed string background and then perform $T$-duality along a space-like isometry to obtain a class of (deformed) G\"{o}del universes. The string background we consider is $AdS_3\times S^3\times {\cal M}_4$. The single-trace $T{\bar T}$ deformation is a particular example of the more general $O(d, d)$ transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model of $N$ 4-component massless fermions in a quartic self-interaction based on ref. \cite{gomes2022} is investigated in the presence of chemical potential and temperature via optimized perturbation theory that accesses finite-N contributions. We use the generating functional approach to calculate the corrections to the effective potential of the model. The model introduces an auxiliary pseudo-vector field with a nontrivial minimum and is influenced by temperature $(T)$ and chemical potential $(\mu)$. These thermodynamic quantities are introduced through Matsubara formalism. Thereby, the integrals are modified, and via the principle of minimum sensitivity, we obtain the gap equations of the model. The correspondent finite-N solutions of these equations define the vacuum states of the model associated with the background pseudo-vector field. In particular, one focuses on its temporal component that acts as an effective chiral chemical potential. We discuss the solutions of the four cases in which $(T = 0,\mu = 0)$, $(T \neq 0,\mu \neq 0)$, $(T \neq 0,\mu = 0)$ and $(T = 0,\mu \neq 0)$, where the effective potential is so obtained as a function of the background vector field, the chemical potential, and the temperature. The model shows the finite-N corrections generate first-order phase transitions on the self-interacting fermions for the case $N=1$ and the persistence of a second-order phase transition for $N \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study holographic renormalization group (RG) flows perturbed by a shock wave in dimensions $d\geq 2$. The flows are obtained by deforming a holographic conformal field theory with a relevant operator, altering the interior geometry from AdS-Schwarzschild to a more general Kasner universe near the spacelike singularity. We introduce null matter in the form of a shock wave into this geometry and scrutinize its impact on the near-horizon and interior dynamics of the black hole. Using out-of-time-order correlators, we find that the scrambling time increases as we increase the strength of the deformation, whereas the butterfly velocity displays a non-monotonic behavior. We examine other observables that are more sensitive to the black hole interior, such as the thermal $a$-function and the entanglement velocity. Notably, the $a$-function experiences a discontinuous jump across the shock wave, signaling an instantaneous loss of degrees of freedom due to the infalling matter. This jump is interpreted as a `cosmological time skip' which arises from an infinitely boosted length contraction. The entanglement velocity exhibits similar dependence to the butterfly velocity as we vary the strength of the deformation. Lastly, we extend our analyses to a model where the interior geometry undergoes an infinite sequence of bouncing Kasner epochs.</description>

Abstract: N=2 conformal supergravity in five dimensions is constructed via a systematic off-shell reduction scheme from maximal conformal supergravity in six dimensions which is (2,0). The dimensional reduction of the (2,0) Weyl multiplet in six dimensions gives us the Weyl multiplet in five dimensions which is a dilaton Weyl multiplet as it has a dilaton scalar. The dimensional reduction of the (2,0) tensor multiplet in six dimensions gives us the N=2 vector multiplet in five dimensions coupled to conformal supergravity. We also comment on Nahm's classification regarding the non-existence of an N=2 superconformal algebra in five dimensions and why it does not contradict the existence of N=2 conformal supergravity in five dimensions that is constructed in this paper.</description>

      <title>A double copy from twisted (co)homology at genus one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the twisted (co)homology of a family of genus-one integrals -- the so called Riemann-Wirtinger integrals. These integrals are closely related to one-loop string amplitudes in chiral splitting where one leaves the loop-momentum, modulus and all but one puncture un-integrated. While not actual one-loop string integrals, they share many properties and are simple enough that the associated twisted (co)homologies have been completely characterized [Goto2022,arXiv:2206.03177]. Using intersection numbers -- an inner product on the vector space of allowed differential forms -- we derive the Gauss-Manin connection for two bases of the twisted cohomology providing an independent check of [Mano&amp;Watanabe2012]. We also use the intersection index -- an inner product on the vector space of allowed contours -- to derive a double-copy formula for the closed-string analogues of Riemann-Wirtinger integrals (one-dimensional integrals over the torus). Similar to the celebrated KLT formula between open- and closed-string tree-level amplitudes, these intersection indices form a genus-one KLT-like kernel defining bilinears in meromorphic Riemann-Wirtinger integrals that are equal to their complex counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a simple lattice model that exhibits a phase transition, the Ising model plays a fundamental role in statistical and condensed matter physics. The Ising transition is realized by physical systems, such as the liquid-vapor transition. Its continuum limit also furnishes a basic example of interacting quantum field theories and universality classes. Motivated by a recent hybrid bootstrap study of the quantum quartic oscillator, we revisit the conformal bootstrap approach to the 3D Ising model at criticality, without resorting to positivity constraints. We use at most 10 nonperturbative crossing constraints at low derivatives from the Taylor expansion around a crossing symmetric point. The high-lying contributions are approximated by simple analytic formulae deduced from the lightcone singularity structure. Surprisingly, the low-lying properties are determined to good accuracy by this computationally very cheap approach. For instance, the results for the two relevant scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma,\Delta_\epsilon)\approx (0.518153,1.41278)$ are close to the most precise rigorous bounds obtained at a much higher computational cost.</description>

Abstract: We provide an improved definition of new conserved quantities derived from the energy-momentum tensor in curved spacetime by introducing an additional scalar function. We find that the conserved current and the associated conserved charge become geometric under a certain initial condition of the scalar function, and show that such a conserved geometric current generally exists in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometric conserved current agrees with the entropy current for the perfect fluid, thus the conserved charge is the total entropy of the system. While the geometric charge can be regarded as the entropy for non-dissipative fluid, its physical meaning should be investigated for more general cases.</description>

Abstract: Gauging a discrete 0-form symmetry of a QFT is a procedure that changes the global form of the gauge group but not its perturbative dynamics. In this work, we study the Seiberg-Witten solution of theories resulting from the gauging of charge conjugation in 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theories with $SU(N)$ gauge group and fundamental hypermultiplets. The basic idea of our procedure is to identify the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ action at the level of the SW curve and perform the quotient, and it should also be applicable to non-lagrangian theories. We study dynamical aspects of these theories such as their moduli space singularities and the corresponding physics; in particular, we explore the complex structure singularity arising from the quotient procedure. We also discuss some implications of our work in regard to three problems: the geometric classification of 4d SCFTs, the study of non-invertible symmetries from the SW geometry, and the String Theory engineering of theories with disconnected gauge groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new model of $\mathcal{N}{=}\,8$ mechanics with semi-dynamic supermultiplets. The model is constructed as an interaction of $\mathcal{N}{=}\,4$ supermultiplets which carry an implicit $\mathcal{N}{=}\,4$ supersymmetry. The initial field content consists of three dynamical $({\bf 1, 4, 3})$ multiplets: one bosonic and two fermionic. To ensure implicit $\mathcal{N}{=}\,4$ supersymmetry, we introduce the superfields describing three semi-dynamical $({\bf 4, 4, 0})$ multiplets: one fermionic and two bosonic. To avoid the second-order Lagrangian for fermions from the fermionic $({\bf 1, 4, 3})$ multiplets, the conversion of their velocities into new auxiliary fields is carried out. After conversion, these multiplets turn into semi-dynamical mirror $({\bf 4, 4, 0})$ multiplets without non-canonical terms in the $\mathcal{N}{=}\,8$ Lagrangian at the component level. The final $\mathcal{N}{=}\,8$ multiplet content is $({\bf 1, 8, 7}) \oplus ({\bf 8, 8, 0})$. As a first step to the ultimate $\mathcal{N}{=}\,4$ superfield formulation of the model, we remind a natural description of the standard and mirror $({\bf 4, 4, 0})$ multiplets in the framework of $\mathcal{N}{=}\,4, d{=}\,1$ biharmonic superspace.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by flat space holography, we demonstrate that massive spin-$s$ fields in Minkowski space near timelike infinity are massive carrollian fields on the carrollian counterpart of anti-de Sitter space called $\mathsf{Ti}$. Its isometries form the Poincar\'e group, and we construct the carrollian spin-$s$ fields using the method of induced representations. We provide a dictionary between massive carrollian fields on $\mathsf{Ti}$ and massive fields in Minkowski space, as well as to fields in the conformal primary basis used in celestial holography. We show that the symmetries of the carrollian structure naturally account for the BMS charges underlying the soft graviton theorem. Finally, we initiate a discussion of the correspondence between massive scattering amplitudes and carrollian correlation functions on $\mathsf{Ti}$, and introduce physical definitions of detector operators using a suitable notion of conserved carrollian energy-momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature renormalization of Standard Model coupled with gravity, and its implications for cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metrics, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. Notably, this method also provides an effective tool for addressing one of the longstanding problems in QCD, the Linde problem. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Inflation and Dark Sector from 11D Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore compactifications of the form of three tori with a general genus and one circle in the framework of 11D supergravity. By imposing suitable gauge conditions and boundary conditions, we find that the FRW universe with four extended spacetime dimensions and seven extremely small compactified spatial dimensions emerges as a solution for the 11D supergravity. These specific compactification methods can produce cosmological inflation that aligns with the observational constraints set by the 2021 BICEP/Keck and Planck 2018 results. In the cosmological inflation models we construct, the inflaton can be interpreted as the conformal vibrations of extra dimensions with a size around 10^5 times the reduced Planck length. Additionally, we offer the theoretical predictions for the mass of the inflaton, and the tree-level Newton's gravity law between two massive point particles surrounded by a spherically symmetric distribution of the inflaton, which can reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation and explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies.</description>

      <title>A two parameter family of lightcone-like hyperbolic string vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two parameter family of string field theory vertices, which we refer to as hyperbolic Kaku vertices. It is defined in terms of hyperbolic metrics on the Riemann surface, but the geometry is allowed to depend on inputs of the states. The vertices are defined for both open and closed strings. In either case, the family contains the hyperbolic vertices. Then we show that the open string lightcone vertex is obtained as the flat limit of the hyperbolic Kaku vertices. The open string Kaku vertices, which interpolate between the Witten vertex and the open string lightcone vertex, is also obtained as a flat limit. We use the same limit on the case of closed strings to define the closed string Kaku vertices: a one parameter family of vertices that interpolates between the polyhedral vertices - which are covariant, but not cubic - and the closed string lightcone vertex - which is cubic, but not Lorentz covariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new closed form expressions for the partition functions of free conformally-coupled scalars on $S^{2D-1}\times S^1$ which resum the exact high-temperature expansion. The derivation relies on an identification of the partition functions, analytically continued in chemical potentials and temperature, with multiple elliptic Gamma functions. These functions satisfy interesting modular properties, which we use to arrive at our expressions. We describe a geometric interpretation of the modular properties of multiple elliptic Gamma functions in the context of superconformal field theory. Based on this, we suggest a geometric interpretation of the modular property in the context of the free scalar CFT in even dimensions and comment on extensions to odd dimensions and free fermions.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

      <title>One point functions in large $N$ vector models at finite chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the thermal one point function of higher spin currents in the critical model of $U(N)$ complex scalars interacting with a quartic potential and the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model of Dirac fermions at large $N$ and strong coupling using the Euclidean inversion formula. These models are considered in odd space time dimensions $d$ and held at finite temperature and finite real chemical potential $\mu$ measured in units of the temperature. We show that these one point functions simplify both at large spin and large $d$. At large spin, the one point functions behave as though the theory is free, the chemical potential appears through a simple pre-factor which is either $\cosh\mu$ or $\sinh\mu$ depending on whether the spin is even or odd. At large $d$, but at finite spin and chemical potential, the 1-point functions are suppressed exponentially in $d$ compared to the free theory. We study a fixed point of the critical Gross-Neveu model in $d=3$ with 1-point functions exhibiting a branch cut in the chemical potential plane. The critical exponent for the free energy or the pressure at the branch point is $3/2$ which coincides with the mean field exponent of the Lee-Yang edge singularity for repulsive core interactions.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying the holographic method, we investigate an RG flow and IR physics holographically when a two-dimensional conformal field theory is deformed by a relevant scalar operator. To do so, we first assume an RG flow from a UV to new IR CFT. On the dual gravity side, such an RG flow can be described by rolling down of a bulk scalar field from an unstable to stable equilibrium point. After considering a simple scalar potential allowing several local extrema, we study the change of a ground state along the RG flow. We show that the entanglement entropy at an IR fixed point leads to a logarithmic divergence due to restoring of the conformal symmetry. We study how the change of the ground state affects two-point functions. In the probe limit, we numerically calculate the change of a conformal dimension caused by the modification of the ground state. We further study the analytic form of the IR conformal dimension which is perfectly matched to the numerical result.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation of Hawking radiations for mass-superposed BTZ black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies using the Unruh-DeWitt detector model have revealed the quantum signatures of black hole mass superposition. In this paper, we use the equal-time density-density correlation function to reinvestigate the mass superposition of BTZ black holes. Interestingly, the quantum signatures of BTZ black hole mass superposition can be revealed by the equal-time density-density correlation peaks. Additionally, different mass superpositions for the same mass ratio can be distinguished, a phenomenon not previously documented. Specifically, the correlation function method can pinpoint the location where Hawking radiations are generated, even for mass-superposed BTZ black holes. Our findings indicate that this location is approximately at two and a half times the radius of the horizon, where the correlation function reaches its maximum.This supports the concept of a quantum atmosphere as the origin locus of Hawking radiation,even in quantum-superposed spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how the number of degrees of freedom in Weyl conformal gravity runs with the energy scale from the UV fixed point. To this end we employ two approaches. First, we utilize the Fradkin--Tseytlin prescription for the number of degrees of freedom and demonstrate that the one-loop results are highly dependent on the selected background. We then employ the counting methodology based on the $a$- and $c$-functions, which are typically used to characterize the trace anomaly of conformal field theory in four dimensions. We compute these in the enhanced one-loop approximation and demonstrate that the degrees of freedom decrease monotonically from six degrees in the UV regime. This behavior is independent of the backgrounds considered. Finally, we show how to relate the Fradkin--Tseytlin prescription to counting based on the $a$- and $c$-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how gauging one-form symmetries in Chern-Simons theories is implemented in an A-twisted topological open string theory. For example, the contribution from a fixed H/Z bundle on a three-manifold M, arising in a BZ gauging of H Chern-Simons, for Z a finite subgroup of the center of H, is described by an open string worldsheet theory whose bulk is a sigma model with target a Z-gerbe (a bundle of one-form symmetries) over T^* M, of characteristic class determined by the H/Z bundle. We give a worldsheet picture of the decomposition of one-form-symmetry-gauged Chern-Simons in three dimensinos, and we describe how a target-space constraint on bundles arising in the gauged Chern-Simons theory has a natural worldsheet realization. Our proposal provides examples of the expected correspondence between worldsheet global higher-form symmetries, and target-space gauged higher-form symmetries.</description>

Abstract: I propose a generalization of the Liouville action which corresponds to the Nambu-Goto string like the usual Liouville action corresponds to the Polyakov string. The two differ by higher-derivative terms which are negligible classically but revive quantumly. An equivalence with the four-derivative action suggests that the Nambu-Goto string in four dimensions can be described by the (4,3) minimal model analogouslyly to the critical Ising model on a dynamical lattice. While critical indices are the same as in the usual Liouville theory, the domain of applicability becomes broader.</description>

      <title>An $E_8 \otimes E_8$ Unification of the Standard Model with Pre-Gravitation, on an Exceptional Lie algebra - Valued Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an $E_8 \otimes E_8$ unification of the standard model with pre-gravitation, on an exceptional Lie algebra-valued space. Each of the $E_8$ has in its branching an $SU(3)$ for space-time and an $SU(3)$ for three fermion generations. The first $E_8$ further branches to the standard model $SU(3)_c \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ and describes the gauge bosons, Higgs and the left chiral fermions of the standard model. The second $E_8$ further branches into a right-handed counterpart (pre-gravitation) $SU(3)_{grav}\otimes SU(2)_R \otimes U(1)_g$ of the standard model, and describes right chiral fermions, a Higgs, and twelve gauge bosons associated with pre-gravitation, from which general relativity is emergent. We account for 208 out of the 496 degrees of freedom of $E_8 \otimes E_8$ and propose an interpretation for the remaining 288, motivated by the trace dynamics Lagrangian of our theory. We explain how the two copies of $SU(3)_{spacetime}$ together give rise to a 6D spacetime with signature $(3,3)$ which upon symmetry breaking gives rise to our 4D spacetime and to a second 4D anti-spacetime with flipped signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we determine the consequences of the quantum entanglement of a system of two identical particles when a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) is considered. GUP's are usually associated with the existence of a minimal length. We focus on the main GUP's (KMM, ADV, Pedram and Nouicer) and then we determine the minimal uncertainties in position induced by those modified GUP's. Our results point out that the minimal uncertainty is reduced by half of its usual value independently of the GUP employed. This implies that the minimal length is also reduced by half. On the other hand, it is generally expected that the minimal length must not depend on physical system. We overcome this apparent paradox by realizing that the entangled system is composed by two particles so that an effective parameter related to the minimal length must be employed.</description>

      <title>Features in the Inflaton Potential and the Spectrum of Cosmological Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbations, originating in the quantum fluctuations of the fields that drive inflation, are observed to be nearly scale invariant at the largest scales. At smaller scales, however, perturbations are not severely constrained and might be of particular importance if their amplitude is large. They can trigger the creation of primordial black holes (PBHs) or stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Small-scale perturbations are generated during the later stages of inflation, when possible strong features in the inflaton potential can break scale invariance and leave characteristic imprints on the spectrum. We focus on and review three types of features: inflection points and steep steps in the potential, as well as sharp turns in the inflationary trajectory in field space. We show that such features induce a strong enhancement of the curvature spectrum within a certain wavenumber range. In particular cases, they also generate characteristic oscillatory patterns that are transferred in the spectrum of secondary GWs, which are potentially observable by operating or designed experiments. We demonstrate these effects through the calculation of the primordial power spectrum and the PBH abundance in the context of $\alpha$-attractors and supergravity (SUGRA) models of inflation.</description>

Abstract: Moving mirrors have been used for a long time as simple models for studying various properties of black hole radiation, such as the thermal spectrum and entanglement entropy. These models are typically constructed to mimic the collapse of a spherically symmetric distribution of matter in the Minkowski background. We generalize this correspondence to the case of non-trivial background geometry and consider two examples, the Schwarzschild -- de Sitter black hole and the Ba\~nados--Teitelboim--Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. In the BTZ case we were also able to show that this approach works for the spinning black hole which has only axial symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids arise when strong interactions destroy stable fermionic quasiparticles. The simplest models featuring this phenomenon involve a Fermi surface coupled to fluctuating gapless bosonic order parameter fields, broadly referred to as "Hertz-Millis" models. We revisit a controlled approach to Hertz-Millis models that combines an expansion in the inverse number ($N$) of fermion species with an expansion in the deviation of the boson dynamical critical exponent $z$ from 2. The structure of the expansion is found to be qualitatively different in the quantum critical regime $\Omega \ll q$ and in the transport regime $\Omega \gg q$. In particular, correlation functions in the transport regime involve infinitely many diagrams at each order in perturbation theory. We provide an explicit and tractable recipe to classify and resum these diagrams. For the simplest Hertz-Millis models, we show that this recipe is consistent with non-perturbative anomaly arguments and correctly captures the fixed point optical conductivity as well as leading corrections from irrelevant operators. We comment on potential applications of this expansion to transport in more complicated Hertz-Millis models as well as certain beyond-Landau metallic quantum critical points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18831v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) on the complex plane, which was treated in our previous research, to finite temperature. As a simple example, we solve the SDE for a model with four-fermion interactions in the (1+1) space-time dimensions at strong coupling region. We investigate the properties of the effective mass and energy for the fermions, especially near the phase transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Identifying regions in wide-angle scattering via graph-theoretical approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The method of regions, which provides a systematic approach for computing Feynman integrals involving multiple kinematic scales, proposes that a Feynman integral can be approximated and even reproduced by summing over integrals expanded in certain regions. A modern perspective of the method of regions considers any given Feynman integral as a specific Newton polytope, defined as the convex hull of the points associated with Symanzik polynomials. The regions then correspond one-to-one with the lower facets of this polytope.
  As Symanzik polynomials correspond to the spanning trees and spanning 2-trees of the Feynman graph, a graph-theoretical study of these polynomials may allow us to identify the complete set of regions for a given expansion. In this work, our primary focus is on three specific expansions: the on-shell expansion of generic wide-angle scattering, the soft expansion of generic wide-angle scattering, and the mass expansion of heavy-to-light decay. For each of these expansions, we employ graph-theoretical approaches to derive the generic forms of the regions involved in the method of regions. The results, applicable to all orders, offer insights that can be leveraged to investigate various aspects of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unique topological portal between quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and a dark sector characterized by a global symmetry breaking, which connects three QCD to two dark pions. When gauged, it serves as the leading portal between the two sectors, providing an elegant, self-consistent scenario of light thermal inelastic dark matter. The inherent antisymmetrization leads to diminished annihilations at later times and suppressed direct detection. However, novel collider signatures offer tremendous prospects for discovery at Belle II.</description>

      <title>$H_0$ tension as a manifestation of the time evolution of gravity coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the time evolution of non minimal gravity coupling can provide a natural explanation to the apparent Hubble tension. The non minimal coupling induces a modification of the Friedman equation with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the low redshift variation of the coupling can can affect the distance of the anchors used to calibrate supernovae (SNe), while higher redshift observations are not affected. Since effective field theory (EFT) in unitary gauge predicts the non minimal coupling to be only a function of time, tests of the equivalence principle are insensitive to it, if experiments are performed in regions of space-time where the time scale of the coupling time evolution is much larger than the experiment time scale. The effects of a time varying non minimal gravity coupling only manifest on sufficiently long time scales, such as in cosmological observations at different redshifts, and if ignored lead to apparent tensions in the values of cosmological parameters estimated with observations from different epochs of the Universe history.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply "hydrodynamic" effective field theory techniques to an ersatz Fermi liquid. Our effective theory, which captures the correlation functions of density operators at each angle on the Fermi surface, can only deviate from conventional Fermi liquid behavior if the effective theory is non-local. Neglecting non-local effects, the ersatz Fermi liquid's effective action is the Legendre transform of the effective action for Fermi liquids, based on the coadjoint orbit method, up to irrelevant corrections.</description>

      <title>Quantum state of fields in $SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity ($SU(\infty)$-QGR)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our Universe is ruled by quantum mechanics and should be treated as a quantum system. {$SU(\infty)$-QGR is a recently proposed quantum model for the Universe, in which gravity is associated to $SU(\infty)$ symmetry of its Hilbert space. Clustering/blockization of its infinite dimensional state due to random quantum fluctuations divides the Universe to approximately isolated subsystems. In addition to parameters of their {\it internal} finite rank symmetries, states and dynamics of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters, and the perceived classical spacetime is their effective representation, reflecting quantum states of subsystems and their relative evolution. At lowest order the effective Lagrangian of {$SU(\infty)$-QGR has the form of Yang-Mills gauge theories for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries defined on the aforementioned 4D parameter space. In the present work we study more thoroughly some of the fundamental aspects of {$SU(\infty)$-QGR. Specifically, we clarify impact of the degeneracy of $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$; describe mixed states of subsystems and their purification; calculate measures of their entanglement to the rest of the Universe; and discuss their role in the emergence of local gauge symmetries. We also describe the relationship between what is called {\it internal space} of $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills with the 4D parameter space, and analytically demonstrate irrelevance of the geometry of parameter space for physical observables. Along with these topics, we demonstrate the equivalence of two sets of criteria for compositeness of a quantum system, and show uniqueness of the limit of various algebras leading to $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization of quantum loop effects generated from large fluctuations is a hugely debatable topic of research these days which rules out the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation within the framework of single-field inflation. In this article, we briefly discuss that the correct implementation of regularization, renormalization, and resummation techniques in a setup described by an ultra-slow-roll phase sandwiched between two slow-roll phases in the presence of smooth or sharp transitions can lead to a stringent constraint on the PBH mass (i.e. ${\cal O}(10^{2}{\rm gm}$)), which we advertise as a new No-go theorem. Finally, we will give some of the possible way-outs using which one can evade this proposed No-go theorem and produce solar/sub-solar mass PBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>No smooth spacetime: Exploring primordial perturbations in Lorentzian quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analysis of quantum cosmology has focused on the Lorentzian path integral formulations of both the no-boundary and tunneling proposals. However, it has been criticized that the wave function for linearized perturbations around a homogeneous and isotropic background leads to an inverse Gaussian distribution. This results in divergent correlation functions and cosmological inconsistencies. In this paper we explore these perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology, focusing in particular on the quantum creation of closed, flat, and open universes from no spacetime and the beginning of primordial inflation. We show that most quantum cosmological scenarios have serious perturbation problems. We also study the effects of trans-Planckian physics on quantum cosmology, using the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion as a case study of modified dispersion relations. Our findings indicate that resolving perturbation problems in Lorentzian quantum cosmology with modified dispersion relations remains a challenge. However, the perturbations can be Gaussian in the quantum creation of the flat or open universe within the confines of the saddle-point approximation and the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion.</description>

Abstract: Particles initially at rest hit by a passing sandwich gravitational wave exhibit, in general, thevelocity memory effect (VM): they fly apart with constant velocity. For specific values of the wave parameters their motion can however become pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. For such a ``miraculous'' value, the particle trajectory is composed of an integer number of (approximate) standing half-waves. Our statements are illustrated numerically by a Gaussian, and analytically by the P\"oschl-Teller profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reissner-Nordstrom anti de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole, characterized by electric charge and negative cosmological constant,exhibits a rich thermodynamics structure. In this paper, we consider the influence of quintessence, a hypothetical dark energy component with negative pressure. we have computed the extended generalized uncertainty principle (EGUP) corrections to the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black hole, including Hawking temperature, heat capacity, entropy function and pressure. Furthermore, as a special case of EGUP, we have computed and compared the result obtained from the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) with those from the extended uncertainty principle (EUP). This work contributes to the understanding of the interplay between fundamental physics and the macroscopic properties of black holes, offering a novel perspective on the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black holes in the context of quintessence and quantum gravity corrections. More importantly, we found that, unlike in the case of the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole, the qualitative behavior for the RN-AdS black hole with quintessence remain largely unchanged, except for minor differences, at the equation of state parameters w=-1/3 and w=-2/3. In addition , unlike RN black holes, the phase transition point of RN-AdS black holes shift to almost zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quadratic algebraically special perturbations (ASPs) of the Schwarzschild black hole. Their dynamics are derived from the expansion up to second order in perturbation of the most general algebraically special twisting vacuum solution of general relativity. Following this strategy, we present analytical expressions for the axial-axial, polar-polar and polar-axial source terms entering in the dynamical equations. We show that these complicated inhomogeneous equations can be solved analytically and we present explicit expressions for the profiles of the quadratic ASPs. As expected, they exhibit exponential growth both at the past and future horizons even in the non-linear regime. We further use this result to analyze the quadratic zero modes and their interpretation in terms of quadratic corrections to mass and spin of the Schwarzschild black hole. The present work provides a direct extension beyond the linear regime of the original work by Couch and Newman.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Spectrum of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy effective theory of a Fermi surface coupled to an Ising-nematic quantum critical point in (2+1) spacetime dimensions with translation symmetry. We formulate the system using the large $N$ Yukawa-SYK model, whose saddle point is described by the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The low-energy physics can be revealed by studying the Gaussian fluctuation spectrum around the saddle point, which is generated by the Bethe-Salpeter kernel $K_\text{BS}$. Based on the Ward identities, we propose an inner product on the space of two point functions, which reveals a large number of soft modes of $K_\text{BS}$. These soft modes parameterize deformation of the Fermi surface, and their fluctuation eigenvalues describe their decay rates. We analytically compute these eigenvalues for a circular Fermi surface, and we discover the odd-parity modes to be parametrically longer-lived than the even-parity modes, due to the kinematic constraint of fermions scattering on a convex FS. The sign of the eigenvalues signals an instability of the Ising-nematic quantum critical point at zero temperature for a convex Fermi surface. At finite temperature, the system can be stabilized by thermal fluctuations of the critical boson. We derive an effective action that describes the soft-mode dynamics, and it leads to a linearized Boltzmann equation, where the real part of the soft-mode eigenvalues can be interpreted as the collision rates. The structure of the effective action is similar to the theory of linear bosonization of a Fermi surface. As an application, we investigate the hydrodynamic transport of non-Fermi liquid. Analyzing the Boltzmann equation, we obtain a conventional hydrodynamic transport regime and a tomographic transport regime. In both regimes, the conductance of the system in finite geometry can be a sharp indicator for the soft-mode dynamics and non-Fermi liquid physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Paczos et al. (Phys. Rev. D 109 (2024)) proposed a covariant quantum field theory for free and interacting tachyon fields. We show that the proposed Feynman propagator leads to unitarity violation in the 1-loop mass renormalization of an ordinary particle it interacts with, proper asymptotic (in/out) tachyon states do not exist, and the proposed S-matrix describing interactions of tachyons and subluminal matter is ill-defined. Since tachyons behave as bosons, interacting tachyons may also self-interact, e.g., any interaction with ordinary matter generates such terms. As a result, the physical vacuum, instead of being at the origin of the potential, may correspond to the proper minimum of the tachyon potential, or such state does not exist at all. Our analysis indicates that quantum tachyon field does not describe a physical on-shell particle with negative mass squared.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of localized initial value profiles when propagated in integrable versions of higher time-derivative theories. In contrast to the standard cases in nonlinear integrable systems, where these profiles evolve into a specific number of N-soliton solutions as dictated by the conservation laws, in the higher time derivative theories the theoretical prediction is that the initial profiles can settle into either two-soliton solutions or into any number of N-soliton solutions. In the latter case this implies that the solutions exhibit oscillations that spread in time but remain finite. We confirm these analytical predictions by explicitly solving the associated Cauchy problem numerically with multiple initial profiles for various higher time-derivative versions of integrable modified Korteweg-de Vries equations. In the case with the theoretical possibility of a decay into two-soliton solutions, the emergence of underlying singularities may prevent the profiles from fully developing or may be accompanied by oscillatory, chargeless standing waves at the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth, within the framework of 1-matrix quantum mechanics (1-MQM). Krylov complexity quantifies how an operator evolves over time by expanding it in a series of nested commutators with the Hamiltonian. We analyze the Lanczos coefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear growth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic behavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both ground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of complexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further studies in more complex holographic theories.</description>

Abstract: The Standard Model Higgs potential is very likely to be metastable, in which case Higgs Inflation is likely to require an extension in order to stabilise the potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$: $T$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, 2/3)$ and $B$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, -1/3)$. Requiring stability of the finite-temperature effective potential, and assuming $m_{t}$ equals its mean value, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The corresponding absolute stability upper bounds are 4.4 TeV and 29 TeV. Small upper bounds are obtained for $B$ quarks. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger constraint on $m_{Q}$, with the $T$ quark upper bound equal to 2.4 TeV for $n_{Q} = 2$ and 13 TeV for $n_{Q} = 3$. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>
