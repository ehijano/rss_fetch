      <title>How Diplomacy Reshapes Online Discourse:Asymmetric Persistence in Online Framing of North Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public opinion toward foreign adversaries shapes and constrains diplomatic options. Prior research has largely relied on sentiment analysis and survey based measures, providing limited insight into how sustained narrative changes (beyond transient emotional reactions) might follow diplomatic engagement. This study examines the extent to which high stakes diplomatic summits shape how adversaries are framed in online discourse. We analyze U.S.-North Korea summit diplomacy (2018-2019) using a Difference-in-Difference(DiD) design on Reddit discussions. Using multiple control groups (China, Iran, Russia) to adjust for concurrent geopolitical shocks, we integrate a validated Codebook LLM framework for framing classification with graph based discourse network analysis that examines both edge level relationships and community level narrative structures. Our results reveal short term asymmetric persistence in framing responses to diplomacy. While both post level and comment level sentiment proved transient (improving during the Singapore Summit but fully reverting after the Hanoi failure),framing exhibited significant stability: the shift from threat oriented to diplomacy oriented framing was only partially reversed. Structurally, the proportion of threat oriented edges decreased substantially (48% -&gt; 28%) while diplomacy oriented structures expanded, and these shifts resisted complete reversion after diplomatic failure. These findings suggest that diplomatic success can leave a short-term but lasting imprint on how adversaries are framed in online discourse, even when subsequent negotiations fail.</description>

      <title>Higher order trade-offs in hypergraph community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending community detection from pairwise networks to hypergraphs introduces fundamental theoretical challenges. Hypergraphs exhibit structural heterogeneity with no direct graph analogue: hyperedges of varying orders can connect nodes across communities in diverse configurations, introducing new trade-offs in defining and detecting community structure. We address these challenges by developing a unified framework for community detection in non-uniform hypergraphs under the Hypergraph Stochastic Block Model. We introduce a general signal-to-noise ratio that enables a quantitative analysis of trade-offs unique to higher-order networks, such as which hypergedges we choose to split across communities and how we choose to split them. Building on this framework, we derive a Bethe Hessian operator for non-uniform hypergraphs that provides efficient spectral clustering with principled model selection. We characterize the resulting spectral detectability threshold and compare it to belief propagation limits, showing the methods coincide for uniform hypergraphs but diverge in non-uniform settings. Synthetic experiments confirm our analytical predictions and reveal systematic biases toward preserving higher-order and balanced-shape hyperedges. Application to empirical data demonstrates the practical relevance of these higher-order detectability trade-offs in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Inferring signed social networks from contact patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks are typically inferred from indirect observations, such as proximity data; yet, most methods cannot distinguish between absent relationships and actual negative ties, as both can result in few or no interactions. We address the challenge of inferring signed networks from contact patterns while accounting for whether lack of interactions reflect a lack of opportunity as opposed to active avoidance. We develop a Bayesian framework with MCMC inference that models interaction groups to separate chance from choice when no interactions are observed. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates superior performance compared to natural baselines, particularly in detecting negative edges. We apply our method to French high school contact data to reveal a structure consistent with friendship surveys and demonstrate the model's adequacy through posterior predictive checks.</description>

      <title>From Ecological Connectivity to Outbreak Risk: A Heterogeneous Graph Network for Epidemiological Reasoning under Sparse Spatiotemporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating population-level prevalence and transmission dynamics of wildlife pathogens can be challenging, partly because surveillance data is sparse, detection-driven, and unevenly sequenced. Using highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 clade 2.3.4.4b as a case study, we develop zooNet, a graph-based epidemiological framework that integrates mechanistic transmission simulation, metadata-driven genetic distance imputation, and spatiotemporal graph learning to reconstruct outbreak dynamics from incomplete observations. Applied to wild bird surveillance data from the United States during 2022, zooNet recovered coherent spatiotemporal structure despite intermittent detections, revealing sustained regional circulation across multiple migratory flyways. The framework consistently identified counties with ongoing transmission weeks to months before confirmed detections, including persistent activity in northeastern regions prior to documented re-emergence. These signals were detectable even in areas with sparse sequencing and irregular reporting. These results show that explicitly representing ecological processes and inferred genomic connectivity within a unified graph structure allows persistence and spatial risk structure to be inferred from detection-driven wildlife surveillance data.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Long-Context Ranking Architecture With Calibrated LLM Distillation: Application to Person-Job Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the most relevant person for a job proposal in real time is challenging, especially when resumes are long, structured, and multilingual. In this paper, we propose a re-ranking model based on a new generation of late cross-attention architecture, that decomposes both resumes and project briefs to efficiently handle long-context inputs with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching. Experiments on relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>ProbeWalk: Fast Estimation of Biharmonic Distance on Graphs via Probe-Driven Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The biharmonic distance is a fundamental metric on graphs that measures the dissimilarity between two nodes, capturing both local and global structures. It has found applications across various fields, including network centrality, graph clustering, and machine learning. These applications typically require efficient evaluation of pairwise biharmonic distances. However, existing algorithms remain computationally expensive. The state-of-the-art method attains an absolute-error guarantee epsilon_abs with time complexity O(L^5 / epsilon_abs^2), where L denotes the truncation length. In this work, we improve the complexity to O(L^3 / epsilon^2) under a relative-error guarantee epsilon via probe-driven random walks. We provide a relative-error guarantee rather than an absolute-error guarantee because biharmonic distances vary by orders of magnitude across node pairs. Since L is often very large in real-world networks (for example, L &gt;= 10^3), reducing the L-dependence from the fifth to the third power yields substantial gains. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show that our method delivers 10x-1000x per-query speedups at matched relative error over strong baselines and scales to graphs with tens of millions of nodes.</description>

      <title>Mobility Inequity and Risk Response After Hurricane Helene: Evidence from Real-Time Travel and Social Sentiment Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hurricanes severely disrupt infrastructure and restrict access to essential services. While the physical impacts on post-disaster mobility are well studied, less is known about how individual travel behaviors change during and after disasters, and how these responses are shaped by social and geographic disparities. This study examines mobility patterns following Hurricane Helene, a Category 4 storm that struck six southeastern U.S. states on September 26, 2024, causing over 230 fatalities. Using anonymized GPS mobility data, hurricane severity metrics, and county-level social media sentiment, we examine shifts in travel behavior and their implications for equity. We ask two questions: How do post-hurricane mobility patterns reflect community vulnerability and adaptive capacity? and How do sociodemographic conditions and public sentiment factors shape the direction and extent of mobility change? Results from robust linear and ordered logistic regressions indicate that evacuation orders increase mobility; however, severe storm conditions, particularly high wind speeds, can limit travel. Communities with lower incomes, located in rural areas, and with higher percentages of Black populations exhibit the steepest declines in mobility, suggesting resource constraints and infrastructural barriers, while wealthier, urban, and higher-education areas maintain greater flexibility. Results also show that positive social sentiment is associated with higher mobility and a greater likelihood of increased travel during the hurricane. Our findings highlight the need to address structural barriers and social conditions in post-disaster mobility and disaster response.</description>

      <title>Efficient Maintenance of Leiden Communities in Large Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a well-known community detection algorithm, Leiden has been widely used in various scenarios such as large language model generation (e.g., Graph-RAG), anomaly detection, and biological analysis. In these scenarios, the graphs are often large and dynamic, where vertices and edges are inserted and deleted frequently, so it is costly to obtain the updated communities by Leiden from scratch when the graph has changed. Recently, one work has attempted to study how to maintain Leiden communities in the dynamic graph, but it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis, and its algorithms are inefficient for large graphs. To address these issues, in this paper, we first theoretically show that the existing algorithms are relatively unbounded via the boundedness analysis (a powerful tool for analyzing incremental algorithms on dynamic graphs), and also analyze the memberships of vertices in communities when the graph changes. Based on theoretical analysis, we develop a novel efficient maintenance algorithm, called Hierarchical Incremental Tree Leiden (HIT-Leiden), which effectively reduces the range of affected vertices by maintaining the connected components and hierarchical community structures. Comprehensive experiments in various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HIT-Leiden. In particular, it achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Life Finds A Way: Emergence of Cooperative Structures in Adaptive Threshold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition.
  We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help''/``harm''), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both connectivity and resilience.
  Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.</description>

      <title>Governing Together: Toward Infrastructure for Community-Run Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralizing the governance of social computing systems to communities promises to empower them to make independent decisions, with nuance and in accordance with their values. Yet, communities do not govern in isolation. Many problems communities face are common, or move across their boundaries. We therefore propose designing for "inter-community governance:" mechanisms that support relationships and interactions between communities to coordinate on governance issues. Drawing from workshops with 24 individuals on decentralized, community-run social media, we present six challenges in designing for inter-community governance surfaced through ideas proposed in workshops. Together, these ideas come together as an ecosystem of resources, infrastructures, and tools that highlight three key principles for designing for inter-community governance: modularity, forkability, and polycentricity. We end with a discussion of how the ideas proposed in workshops might be implemented in future work aiming to support community governance in social computing systems broadly.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</description>
