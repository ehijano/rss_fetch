      <title>A waveform iteration implementation for black-box multi-rate higher-order coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many multiphysics simulations involve processes evolving on disparate time scales, posing a challenge for efficient coupling. A naive approach that synchronizes all processes using the smallest time scale wastes computational resources on slower processes and typically achieves only linear convergence in time. Waveform iteration is a promising numerical technique that enables higher-order, multi-rate coupling while treating coupled components as black boxes. However, applying this approach to PDE-based coupled simulations is nontrivial.
  In this paper, we integrate waveform iteration into the black-box coupling library preCICE with minimal modifications to its API. We detail how this extension interacts with key preCICE features, including data mapping for non-matching meshes, quasi-Newton acceleration for strongly coupled problems, and parallel peer-to-peer communication. We then showcase that waveform iteration significantly reduces numerical errors -- often by orders of magnitude. This advancement greatly enhances preCICE, benefiting its extensive user community.</description>

      <title>A New Initial Approximation Bound in the Durand Kerner Algorithm for Finding Polynomial Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Durand-Kerner algorithm is a widely used iterative technique for simultaneously finding all the roots of a polynomial. However, its convergence heavily depends on the choice of initial approximations. This paper introduces two novel approaches for determining the initial values: New bound 1 and the lambda maximal bound, aimed at improving the stability and convergence speed of the algorithm. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these bounds. The lambda maximal bound consistently ensures that all the roots lie within the complex circle, leading to faster and more stable convergence. Comparative results demonstrate that while New bound 1 guarantees convergence, but it yields excessively large radii.</description>

      <title>TurboSAT: Gradient-Guided Boolean Satisfiability Accelerated on GPU-CPU Hybrid System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While accelerated computing has transformed many domains of computing, its impact on logical reasoning, specifically Boolean satisfiability (SAT), remains limited. State-of-the-art SAT solvers rely heavily on inherently sequential conflict-driven search algorithms that offer powerful heuristics but limit the amount of parallelism that could otherwise enable significantly more scalable SAT solving. Inspired by neural network training, we formulate the SAT problem as a binarized matrix-matrix multiplication layer that could be optimized using a differentiable objective function. Enabled by this encoding, we combine the strengths of parallel differentiable optimization and sequential search to accelerate SAT on a hybrid GPU-CPU system. In this system, the GPUs leverage parallel differentiable solving to rapidly evaluate SAT clauses and use gradients to stochastically explore the solution space and optimize variable assignments. Promising partial assignments generated by the GPUs are post-processed on many CPU threads which exploit conflict-driven sequential search to further traverse the solution subspaces and identify complete assignments. Prototyping the hybrid solver on an NVIDIA DGX GB200 node, our solver achieves runtime speedups up to over 200x when compared to a state-of-the-art CPU-based solver on public satisfiable benchmark problems from the SAT Competition.</description>
