      <title>Non-classical Temperature Dependence of Chirality-Induced Magnetization and Its Implications for RNA's Homochirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single-handedness of biomolecules is a characteristic feature of life on Earth, yet achieving and maintaining a homochiral prebiotic network is a significant challenge. In our previous studies, we reached homochirality in an RNA precursor, ribo-aminooxazoline (RAO), using magnetized magnetite surfaces as chiral reagents, due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. We further demonstrated that RAO can induce net magnetization on previously demagnetized surfaces, indicating a self-reinforcing feedback between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces. However, these processes depend on spin interactions that generally weaken at higher temperatures, raising concerns about the robustness of our mechanisms in natural settings. Additionally, the temperature dependence of CISS remains poorly understood. To address these questions, we investigated the temperature dependence of chirality-induced magnetization. Contrary to classical expectations, we observed a significant increase in induced net magnetization with increasing temperatures, suggesting a phonon-assisted process. Concurrently, we noted a corresponding increase in the relative yield of RAO during its prebiotic synthesis. Our results support a vibronic contribution to CISS and indicate that spin-controlled processes leading to RNA homochirality can occur reliably and effectively over a range of temperatures likely present in prebiotic environments.</description>

      <title>Transcorrelated Theory with Pseudopotentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transcorrelated (TC) method performs a similarity transformation on the
  electronic Schr\"odinger equation via Jastrow factorization of the wave function. This
  has demonstrated significant advancements in computational
  electronic structure theory by
  improving basis set convergence and compactifying the description of the wave function. In
  this work, we introduce a new approach that incorporates pseudopotentials (PPs) into the
  TC framework, significantly accelerating Jastrow factor optimization and reducing
  computational costs. Our results for ionization potentials, atomization energies, and
  dissociation curves of first-row atoms and molecules show that PPs provide chemically
  accurate descriptions across a range of systems and give guidelines for future
  theory and applications.
  The new pseudopotential-based TC method opens possibilities for applying TC to more complex
  and larger systems, such as transition metals and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Implicit Delta Learning of High Fidelity Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a fast and accurate alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations but are hindered by the high cost of training data from high-fidelity Quantum Mechanics (QM) methods. Our work introduces the Implicit Delta Learning (IDLe) method, which reduces the need for high-fidelity QM data by leveraging cheaper semi-empirical QM computations without compromising NNP accuracy or inference cost. IDLe employs an end-to-end multi-task architecture with fidelity-specific heads that decode energies based on a shared latent representation of the input atomistic system. In various settings, IDLe achieves the same accuracy as single high-fidelity baselines while using up to 50x less high-fidelity data. This result could significantly reduce data generation cost and consequently enhance accuracy and generalization, and expand chemical coverage for NNPs, advancing MD simulations for material science and drug discovery. Additionally, we provide a novel set of 11 million semi-empirical QM calculations to support future multi-fidelity NNP modeling.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects of Coulomb explosion simulations revealed by time-dependent density-functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of quantum effects on Coulomb explosion dynamics using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations, comparing classical, semi-classical, and quantum approaches. The goal is to elucidate how electron dynamics affect the kinetic energy, angular distribution, and final velocities of ejected ions. The results indicate that quantum effects result in lower kinetic energies all ions, deviating from classical predictions. Furthermore, quantum simulations exhibit broader angular distributions and more diverse ion trajectories, aligning closely with experimental observations. The research also highlights the role of laser intensity and the resultant ionization in enhancing quantum effects, particularly in modifying ion velocities and distributions. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the role of electron dynamics in Coulomb explosions, offering valuable insights for both experimental and theoretical studies of molecular fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Climate Change-Induced Salinity Intrusion on Physiological Parameters of Aquatic Hydrophytes from Coastal Rivers of Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changing temperature, precipitation regimes, and sea level rise, often associated with climate change, cause salinity intrusion into groundwater and surface water, affecting aquatic ecosystems. This study investigates the impacts of salinity on the physiological traits of freshwater hydrophytes, including Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), Buffalo Spinach (Enhydra fluctuans), and Taro (Colocasia esculenta). The plants were exposed to salinity concentrations of 0, 10, 20, and 30 ppt for 48 hours. Parameters such as biomass, stomata density, transpiration rate, chlorophyll content, relative water content, and histo-architectural changes were analyzed. The results showed a decline in biomass, stomatal density, and relative water content with increasing salinity. Taro demonstrated higher salt tolerance compared to other species. Histological observations revealed deformities in root and tuber tissues under saline stress. These findings highlight the critical impacts of climate change-induced salinity on aquatic plant ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fenton-like Photo-degradation and Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in Fe-doped Copper Oxide (CuO) Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although hydrogen generation by water electrolysis is the cheapest of all other available sources, water splitting still occurs with sluggish kinetics. It is a challenging barrier for H2 production on a large scale. Moreover, research is still underway to understand the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and design the catalysts with improved OER performance. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and OER performance of iron-doped copper oxide (CuO) as low-cost catalysts for water oxidation. The OER occurs at about 1.49 V versus the RHE with a Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential of 338 mV at 10 mA/cm2 is among the lowest compared with other copper-based materials. The catalyst can deliver a stable current density of &gt;10 mA/cm2 for more than 10 hours. Additionally, wastewater treatment, particularly synthetic dye wastewater, is vital for preventing water scarcity and adverse effects on human health and ecotoxicology. The as-synthesized catalysts are also utilized for Fenton-like photo-degradation under low-power visible household LED lights toward the most commonly industrially used simulated Methylene blue dye wastewater. Almost complete degradation of the MB dye has been achieved within 50 minutes of visible light irradiation with a first-order rate constant of 0.0973/min. This dual functionality feature can open new pathways as a non-noble, highly efficient, and robust catalyst for OER and wastewater treatments.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic density-functional theory for the moving contact-line problem reveals fluid structure and emergence of a spatially distinct pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nanoscale effects controlling the dynamics of a contact line -- defined as the line formed at the junction of two fluid phases and a solid -- has been a longstanding problem in fluid mechanics pushing experimental and numerical methods to their limits. A major challenge is the multiscale nature of the problem, whereby nanoscale phenomena manifest themselves at the macroscale. To probe the nanoscale, not easily accessible to other methods, we propose a reductionist model that employs elements from statistical mechanics, namely dynamic-density-functional theory (DDFT), in a Navier-Stokes-like equation -- an approach we name hydrodynamic DDFT. The model is applied to an isothermal Lennard-Jones-fluid with no slip on a flat solid substrate. Our computations reveal fluid stratification with an oscillatory density structure close to the wall and the emergence of two distinct regions as the temperature increases: a region of compression on the vapor side of the liquid-vapour interface and an effective slip region of large shear on the liquid side. The compressive region spreads along the fluid interface at a lengthscale that increases faster than the width of the fluid interface with temperature, while the width of the slip region is bound by the oscillatory fluid density structure and is constrained to a few particle diameters from the wall. Both compressive and shear effects may offset contact line friction, while compression in particular has a disproportionately high effect on the speed of advancing contact lines at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Melting behavior of CaO at high temperature and pressure: a molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic behavior of calcium oxide (\ce{CaO}) under high temperature and pressure conditions is critical for understanding the physics of planetary interiors. This study employs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including both classical and ab-initio approaches, to investigate the melting behavior of CaO. We calculate the melting temperature of \ce{CaO} by the void-nucleated melting and two-phase coexistence techniques, aiming to resolve discrepancies in experimental data on the melting point, which range from 2843~K to 3223~K in different studies due to the high reactivity and vapor pressure of the substance. The obtained results are $T_f = 3066\pm12$~K and $T_f = 2940\pm65$~K using the void-nucleated melting and the two-phase coexistence method, respectively. Additionally, we calculate the enthalpy of fusion and the high-pressure melting curve, for the first time without making any assumption on the Clapeyron slope. This is extremely important since in experiments the Claperyon slope of the melting curve is estimated from low pressure measurements and the overheating ratio (i.e. $\eta=\frac{T_s}{T_f}-1$, where $T_s$ represents the thermal instability limit corresponding to the homogeneous melting temperature of the solid) is often assumed to be constant in simulations. Our MD results show that $T_s$ increases more rapidly with pressure than $T_f$ and thus that the overheating ratio sensibly depends upon pressure. These findings contribute to the accurate modeling of the CaO phase diagram, which is essential for geochemistry, cosmochemistry, and materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06449v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next-generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor-made solid-state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles, and techniques such as co-crystallisation, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterised by methods such as X-Ray Diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here we present our database of small molecular crystals, and their Density Functional Theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring longitudinal d33 constant. This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.</description>

      <title>Can Neural Networks Learn Nanoscale Friction?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current nanofriction experiments on crystals, both tip-on-surface and surface-on-surface, provide force traces as their sole output, typically exhibiting atomic size stick-slip oscillations. Physically interpreting these traces is a task left to the researcher. Historically done by hand, it generally consists in identifying the parameters of a Prandtl-Tomlinson (PT) model that best reproduces these traces. This procedure is both work-intensive and quite uncertain. We explore in this work how machine learning (ML) could be harnessed to do that job with optimal results, and minimal human work. A set of synthetic force traces is produced by PT model simulations covering a large span of parameters, and a simple neural network (NN) perceptron is trained with it. Once this trained NN is fed with experimental force traces, it will ideally output the PT parameters that best approximate them. By following this route step by step, we encountered and solved a variety of problems which proved most instructive and revealing. In particular, and very importantly, we met unexpected inaccuracies with which one or another parameter was learned by the NN. The problem, we then show, could be eliminated by proper manipulations and augmentations operated on the training force traces, and that without extra efforts and without injecting experimental informations. Direct application to the sliding of a graphene coated AFM tip on a variety of 2D materials substrates validates and encourages use of this ML method as a ready tool to rationalise and interpret future stick-slip nanofriction data.</description>

      <title>Inelastic H + H^+_3 Collision rates and their impact in the determination of the excitation temperature of H^+_3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. In dffuse interstellar clouds the excitation temperature derived from the lowest levels of H+3 is systematically lower than that derived from H2. The differences may be attributed to the lack of state-specific formation and destruction rates of H+ 3 needed to thermalize the two species. Aims. In this work, we want to check the role of rotational excitation collisions of H+3 with atomic hydrogen on its excitation temperature. Methods. A time independent close-coupling method is used to calculate the state-to-state rate coefficients, using a very accurate and full dimensional potential energy surface recently developed for H+4. A symmetric top approach is used to describe a frozen H+3 as equilateral triangle. Results. Rotational excitation collision rate coefficients of H+3 with atomic Hydrogen have been derived in a temperature range appropriate to diffuse interstellar conditions up to (J; K; ?) = (7; 6; +) and (J; K; ?) = (6; 4; +) for its ortho and para forms. This allows to have a consistent set of collisional excitation rate coefficients and to improve the previous study where these contributions were speculated. Conclusions. The new state-specific inelastic H+3 + H rate coeffcients yield differences up to 20% in the excitation temperature, and their impact increases with decreasing molecular fraction. We also confirm the impact of chemical state-to-state destruction reactions in the excitation balance of H+3 , and that reactive H + H+3 collisions are also needed to account for possible further ortho to para transitions</description>

Abstract: The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.</description>

      <title>A phase-space view of vibrational energies without the Born-Oppenheimer framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that following the standard mantra of quantum chemistry and diagonalizing the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) Hamiltonian $\hat H_{\rm BO}(\bm R)$ is not the optimal means to construct potential energy surfaces. A better approach is to diagonalize a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian, $\hat H_{\rm PS}(\bm R,\bm P)$, which is parameterized by both nuclear position $\bm R$ and nuclear momentum $\bm P$. The foundation of such a non-perturbative phase-space electronic Hamiltonian can be made rigorous using a partial Wigner transform and the method has exactly the same cost as BO for a semiclassical calculation (and only a slight increase in cost for a quantum nuclear calculation). For a three-particle system, with two heavy particles and one light particle, numerical results show that a phase space electronic Hamiltonian produces not only meaningful electronic momenta (which are completely ignored by BO theory) but also far better vibrational energies. As such, for high level results and/or systems with degeneracies and spin degrees of freedom, we anticipate that future electronic structure and quantum chemistry packages will need to take as input not just the positions of the nuclei but also their momenta.</description>

      <title>Alchemical harmonic approximation based potential for iso-electronic diatomics: Foundational baseline for $\Delta$-machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) of the absolute electronic energy for charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomics at fixed interatomic distance $d_0$. To account for variations in distance, we combine AHA with this Ansatz for the electronic binding potential, $E(d)=(E_{u}-E_s) \left(\frac{E_c-E_s}{E_u-E_s}\right)^{\sqrt{d/d_0}}+E_s$, where $E_u,E_c,E_s$ correspond to the energies of united atom, calibration at $d_0$, and sum of infinitely separated atoms, respectively. Our model covers the entire two-dimensional electronic potential energy surface spanned by distance and difference in nuclear charge from which only one single point (with elements of nuclear charge $Z_1,Z_2$ and distance $d_0$) is drawn to calibrate $E_c$. Using reference data from pbe0/cc-pVDZ, we present numerical evidence for the electronic ground-state of all neutral diatomics with 8, 10, 12, 14 electrons. We assess the validity of our model by comparison to legacy interatomic potentials (Harmonic oscillator, Lennard-Jones, and Morse) within the most relevant range of binding (0.7 - 2.5 A), and find comparable accuracy if restricted to single diatomics, and significantly better predictive power when extrapolating to the entire iso-electronic series. We also investigated $\Delta$-learning of the electronic absolute energy using our model as baseline. This baseline model results in a systematic improvement, effectively reducing training data needs for reaching chemical accuracy by up to an order of magnitude from $\sim$1000 to $\sim$100. By contrast, using AHA+Morse as a baseline hardly leads to any improvement, and sometimes even deteriorates the predictive power. Inferring the energy of unseen CO converges to a prediction error of $\sim$0.1 Ha in direct learning, and $\sim$0.04 Ha with our baseline.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD with Complex-Valued Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) and coupled cluster theory restricted to paired double excitations (pCCD) are emerging as efficient methodologies for accounting for the so-called non-dynamic electronic correlation effects. Up to now, molecular calculations have been performed with real-valued orbitals. However, before extending the applicability of these methodologies to extended systems, where Bloch states are employed, the subtleties of working with complex-valued orbitals and the consequences of imposing time-reversal symmetry must be carefully addressed. In this work, we describe the theoretical and practical implications of adopting time-reversal symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD when allowing for complex-valued orbital coefficients. The theoretical considerations primarily affect the optimization algorithms, while the practical implications raise fundamental questions about the stability of solutions. Specifically, we find that complex solutions lower the energy when non-dynamic electronic correlation effects are pronounced. We present numerical examples to illustrate and discuss these instabilities and possible problems introduced by N-representability violations.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>EquiJump: Protein Dynamics Simulation via SO(3)-Equivariant Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mapping the conformational dynamics of proteins is crucial for elucidating their functional mechanisms. While Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation enables detailed time evolution of protein motion, its computational toll hinders its use in practice. To address this challenge, multiple deep learning models for reproducing and accelerating MD have been proposed drawing on transport-based generative methods. However, existing work focuses on generation through transport of samples from prior distributions, that can often be distant from the data manifold. The recently proposed framework of stochastic interpolants, instead, enables transport between arbitrary distribution endpoints. Building upon this work, we introduce EquiJump, a transferable SO(3)-equivariant model that bridges all-atom protein dynamics simulation time steps directly. Our approach unifies diverse sampling methods and is benchmarked against existing models on trajectory data of fast folding proteins. EquiJump achieves state-of-the-art results on dynamics simulation with a transferable model on all of the fast folding proteins.</description>
