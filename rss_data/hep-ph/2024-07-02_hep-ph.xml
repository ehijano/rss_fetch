      <title>Hydrogen energy levels from the anomalous energy-momentum QED trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy levels of hydrogen are calculated as one-loop matrix elements of the QED energy-momentum tensor trace in the external field approximation. An explicit connection established between the one-loop trace diagrams and the standard Lamb shift one-loop diagrams. Our calculations provide an illustration how the trace anomaly is realized in the bound state QED.</description>

      <title>Theoretical point of view on Cabibbo angle anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the current situation of the determinations of the first-row CKM components and show the Cabibbo angle anomaly corresponding to a deficit in the first-row CKM unitarity condition at the $3\sigma$ level. In this contribution, we show two new physics interpretations: heavy vector-like quark models and a MeV scale sterile neutrino models. The super tau-charm facility will directly probe the other CKM unitarity conditions related to $V_{cd}$.</description>

      <title>On Wigner Degeneracy in Elko theory: Hermiticity and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a set of Hermitian interactions for quantum fields based on Elko, considering the recent achievements concerning the most general form of singular spinors and Wigner degeneracy. We consider Hermiticity and renormalizability a criterion to define the derivative Elko-Higgs interaction as the suitable candidate for a dark coupling. Then, the free parameters of the model are fixed by cosmological constraints on the dark matter abundance, bounds on the Higgs invisible decays, and limits on the electron-dark matter scattering mediated by the Higgs.</description>

      <title>$W-$mass and Muon $g-2$ in Inert 2HDM Extended by Singlet Complex Scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deviations of the recent measurements of the muon magnetic moment and the $W-$boson mass from their SM predictions hint to new physics beyond the SM. In this article, we address the observed discrepancies in the $W$-boson mass and muon anomalous magnetic moment in the Inert Two Higgs Doublet Model (I2HDM) extended by a complex scalar field singlet under the SM gauge group. The model is constrained from the existing LEP data and the measurements of partial decay widths to gauge bosons at LHC. It is shown that a large subset of this constrained parameter space of the model can simultaneously accommodate the $W$-boson mass and also explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we review the application of modern machine-learning~(ML) techniques to boost the search for processes involving the top quarks at the LHC. We revisit the formalism of Convolutional Neural Networks~(CNNs), Graph Neural Networks~(GNNs), and Attention Mechanisms. Based on recent studies, we explore their applications in designing improved top taggers, top reconstruction, and event classification tasks. We also examine the ML-based likelihood-free inference approach and generative unfolding models, focusing on their applications to scenarios involving top quarks.</description>

      <title>The high temperature QCD static potential beyond leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the leading and next-to-leading corrections to the real-time QCD static potential in a high temperature medium in the region where bound states transit from narrow resonances to wide ones. We find sizable contributions to both the real and the imaginary part of the potential. The calculation involves both loop diagrams calculated in the Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) effective theory and power corrections to the HTL Lagrangian calculated in QCD. We compare our results with recent lattice data.</description>

      <title>Study of semileptonic $B\to DP\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays based on the SU(3) flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decays $B\to DP\ell^+\nu_\ell~(\ell=e,\mu,\tau)$ with the non-resonance, the charmed vector resonances, the charmed scalar resonances and the charmed tensor resonances are calculated by using the SU(3) flavor symmetry. Firstly, the decay amplitudes of different modes are related by the SU(3) flavor symmetry. Then, relevant experiential data are used to constrain nonperturbative coefficients in the non-resonant and various resonant $B\to DP\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays. Finally, using the constrained nonperturbative coefficients, the branching ratios of not-yet-measured $B\to D^*P\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays with the non-resonant and various charmed resonant contributions are predicted. Many branching ratios are predicted for the first time. We find that $B\to D\eta'\ell^+\nu_\ell, B_s\to D_s\eta'\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays only receive the non-resonant contributions, $B\to D_sK\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B_s\to DK\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B\to D\eta\ell^+\nu_\ell$ and $B_s\to D_s\eta\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays receive both non-resonant and charmed tensor resonant contributions, $B^+\to D^-\pi^+\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays receive the non-resonant, the charmed scalar resonant and the charmed tensor resonant contributions, and other $B\to D\pi\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays receive all four kinds of contributions. These results can be used to test the SU(3) flavor symmetry approach in the four-body semileptonic decays by the future LHCb and Belle-II experiments.</description>

      <title>Observable CP-violation in charmed baryons decays with SU(3) symmetry analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP violation in baryon decays has recently garnered significant attention. Traditionally, CP violation in charmed baryon decays is predicted to be at the order of $O(10^{-4})$. Utilizing recent measurements from BESIII, Belle and Belle~II experiments, we conduct a comprehensive global analysis to estimate the contribution of topological diagrams in these processes. Our study reveals that topological diagrams alone cannot fully account for the experimental data. By incorporating new effects that are not included in traditional topological diagrams and exploring a novel way to determine the possible new weak phase, our analysis reveals the potential for significant CP violation in $\Lambda_c^+\to p \eta/ n \pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^+\to \Xi^0 K^+$. This suggests a promising opportunity to observe CP violation for the first time in charmed baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Effects of Family Non-universal $Z^{\prime}$ Model in the angular observables of $B\to(\rho,a_{1})\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the angular distribution of the four-fold $B\to\rho (\to\pi\pi)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ and $B\to a_{1}(\to\rho_{\parallel, \perp}\pi)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decays both in the Standard Model and the family non-universal $Z^{\prime}$ model. At the quark level, these decays are governed by the $b\to d\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ transition. Along with different angular observables, we also give predictions of differential branching ratios, forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal polarization fraction of $\rho$, and $a_{1}$ mesons. Our analysis shows that the signatures of family non-universal $Z^{\prime}$ model are more distinct in the observables associated with the $B\to\rho(\to\pi\pi)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay, compared to that of the $B\to a_{1}(\to\rho_{\parallel, \perp}\pi)\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay. Future measurements of the predicted angular observables, both at current and future high energy colliders, will add to the useful complementary data required to clarify the structure of the family non-universal $Z^{\prime}$ model in $|\Delta b|$=$|\Delta d|=1$ processes.</description>

      <title>NNLO PDFs driven by top-quark data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of state-of-the-art top-quark data collected at the Large Hadron Collider on parton distribution functions (PDFs). Following the ABMP methodology, the fit extracts simultaneously proton PDFs, the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ and heavy-quark masses at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD. It includes recent high-statistics data on absolute total inclusive cross sections for $t\bar{t}+X$, the sum of $(t + X)$ and $(\bar{t} + X)$ hadroproduction, and normalized inclusive data double-differential in the invariant mass and rapidity of the $t\bar{t}$ pair at $\sqrt{S}=13$ TeV. The gluon PDF at large $x$ and the top-quark mass value derived from these data are well compatible with the previous ABMP16 results, but with significantly smaller uncertainties, reduced by up to a factor of two. At NNLO in QCD we obtain for the strong coupling the value $\alpha_s^{(n_f=5)}(M_Z)= 0.1150 \pm 0.0009$ and for the top-quark mass in the ${\overline{\mbox{MS}}}$-scheme $m_t(m_t) = 160.6 \pm 0.6$ GeV, corresponding to $m_t^{\rm pole} = 170.2 \pm 0.7$ GeV in the on-shell scheme. The new fit, dubbed ABMPtt, is publicly released in grids in LHAPDF format.</description>

      <title>Rotation effect on the spectral function of heavy vector mesons in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring heavy vector mesons of the $ J / \psi$ and $ \Upsilon ( 1 S )$ is crucial for understanding the quark gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy ion collisions. The influences of rotational effect on the properties of the $ J / \psi$ and the $ \Upsilon ( 1 S )$ are investigated by incorporating rotation medium into the holographic QCD. It is found that temperature, chemical potential, and rotational radius effects enhance the dissociation process of the $ J / \psi$ and the $ \Upsilon ( 1 S )$ states within the medium. This rotation-induced effect is more significant for heavy vector mesons in the transverse direction than that of the longitudinal direction. The first holographic study on the influence of the radius of a homogeneous rotating system on the vector meson spectrum is proposed. It is found that increasing in rotation radius promotes the dissociation of vector mesons of the $ J / \psi$ and $ \Upsilon ( 1 S )$. We also find that the dissociation perpendicular to the direction of rotational angular velocity is more significant than that parallel to it at large rational radius.</description>

      <title>Study of $\tau^- \to \omega \pi^- \nu_\tau$ decay in resonance chiral theory with tensor sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we make a study of the $\tau^- \to \omega\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay in the framework of low-energy effective field theory. The $J^{\mathcal{P}G}$ decompositions of the quark currents and the $\omega\pi$ final state show that, besides the Standard Model vector interaction, only the non-standard tensor interaction can have a non-zero contribution to the decay. To discuss its effect, a reliable calculation of the $\omega\pi$ tensor form factors is necessary. After constructing the Lagrangian of resonance chiral theory with external tensor sources, we calculate both the vector and tensor form factors with the relevant resonance couplings determined by combining the QCD short-distance constraints, the fit to the spectral function of $\tau^- \to \omega\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay, as well as the matching between the $\mathcal{O}(p^4)$ odd-intrinsic-parity operators after integrating out the vector resonances and the $\mathcal{O}(p^6)$ operators of chiral perturbation theory. The new physics effect is then investigated in the distributions of the spectral function and the forward-backward asymmetry of $\tau^- \to \omega\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay. We find that the spectral function is dominated by the Standard Model, and the non-standard tensor contribution is negligible. However, since the forward-backward asymmetry can be only generated with a non-zero tensor interaction, the observable is quite sensitive to this kind of new physics. A future measurement of the observable at the Belle II experiment as well as at the proposed Tera-Z and STCF facilities is, therefore, strongly called for to check the existence of such a non-standard tensor interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the two-loop heavy quarkonium Hamiltonian within potential-NRQCD effective field theory in the non-annihilation channel. This calculation represents the first non-trivial step towards determining the N$^4$LO Hamiltonian in the weak coupling regime. To cope with the large amount of calculations, we make use of the $\beta$ expansion and differential equation for master integrals and systematize the procedure.</description>

      <title>The third family quark mass hierarchy and FCNC in the universal seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the study of the quark sector of the universal seesaw model with $\mathrm{SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{Y'}}$ gauge symmetry in the massless case of the two lightest quark families. This model aims to explain the mass hierarchy of the third family quark by introducing a vector-like quark (VLQ) partner for each quark. In this model, we introduce $\mathrm{SU(2)_L}$ and $\mathrm{SU(2)_R}$ Higgs doublets. We derive explicitly the Lagrangian for the quark sector, Higgs sector, and kinetic terms of the gauge fields, starting from the Lagrangian, which is invariant under $\mathrm{SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{Y'}}$ gauge symmetry. At each stage of the symmetry breaking, we present the Lagrangian with the remaining gauge symmetry. Additionally, we investigate the flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) of Higgs ($h$) and $Z$-boson in the interaction with the top, heavy top, bottom, and heavy bottom quark.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking: From the Effective Action to Cosmological Phase Transitions in the Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this work is to investigate the cosmological phase transitions in the early Universe, with a focus on the electroweak phase transition in the Standard Model and its extensions. In the Standard Model, the spontaneously broken electroweak symmetry at zero temperature is restored in the early Universe due to finite-temperature effects. This phenomenon is studied using the effective potential at finite temperatures, which determines the true vacuum state of the theory. Symmetry restoration at high temperatures is also studied by the finite-temperature field theory introduced to derive the Feynman rules at finite temperatures using the imaginary-time formalism. Furthermore, we present the theory of cosmological phase transitions, focusing on the concepts of thermal tunneling and bubble nucleation. We additionally discuss the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe to formulate the conditions for baryogenesis and describe electroweak baryogenesis. Therefore, the one-loop effective potential in the Standard Model at finite temperatures is derived in detail including the ring corrections to study further the electroweak baryogenesis. Our results indicate that the electroweak phase transition is not strong enough to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. On the other hand, the real singlet extensions of the Standard Model describe a strong enough electroweak phase transition and the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. These extensions are also discussed including a dimension-six operator, which originates from an effective field theory. In particular, the parameter space of this singlet extension is examined extensively, while it is restricted by numerous phenomenological constraints, such as the invisible Higgs decay width.</description>

      <title>A plan for a super $\eta$ factory at Huizhou accelerator complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a Goldstone boson with zero quantum number and zero SM charge, the decays of long-lived $\eta$ ($\eta^{\prime}$) meson provide a unique window to search new physics beyond the standard model and new sources of CP violation, to test the low-energy QCD theory, and to measure the fundamental parameters of light quarks. For such goals in the physics frontiers we discuss a plan of building a super $\eta$ factory at HIAF high-energy terminal or at CiADS after upgrade. The high-intensity proton beam at HIAF provides a great opportunity of producing a huge number of $\eta$ samples of more than $10^{13}$ events per year, with multiple layers of thin targets of light nucleus. The physics goals, the first-version conceptual design of the spectrometer, and the preliminary simulation results are present.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations originate from virtual excitation of Z bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To account for neutrino oscillations, it is postulated that the neutrino has nonvanishing mass and each flavor eigenstate is formed by three distinct mass eigenstates, whose probability amplitudes interfere with each other during its propagation. However, I find that the energy conservation law requires these mass eigenstates, if they exist, to be entangled with distinct joint energy eigenstates of the other particles produced by the same weak interaction as the neutrino. This entanglement destroys the quantum coherence among the neutrino's mass eigenstates, which are responsible for flavor oscillations under the aforementioned postulation. I reveal that the neutrino oscillations actually originate from virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the space. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then immediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation produces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three flavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by the competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence effect resulting from scatterings.</description>

      <title>Dark matter-electron scattering and freeze-in scenarios in the light of $Z^\prime$ mediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM)-electron scattering in a minimal $U(1)_X$ extension of the Standard Model (SM), where the DM can appear as a Majorana fermion, a complex singlet scalar or a Dirac fermion. To study bounds on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and new gauge boson mass $(M_{Z^\prime})$, from DM-electron scattering, we consider several direct search experiments like CDMS, DAMIC, SENSEI, PandaX-II, DarkSide-50 and XENON1T-S2 for different $U(1)_X$ charges. In this set-up we consider DM production via freeze-in both in radiation dominated and modified cosmological background to project sensitivities on $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane satisfying observed relic abundance. DM-electron scattering could provide comparable, or even stronger bounds than those obtained from the electron/ muon $(g-2)$, low energy scattering and intensity frontier experiments within 0.01 GeV $\lesssim M_{Z^\prime} \lesssim$ 0.1 GeV. Constrains from freeze-in could provide stronger sensitivities for $M_{Z^\prime}\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV, however, these limits are comparable to those obtained from LHCb, LEP experiments for $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV $\lesssim M_{Z^\prime} \lesssim 150$ GeV. In future, electron-muon scattering (MUonE), proton (FASER, DUNE) and electron/positron (ILC) beam dump experiments could probe these parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of B mesons can be predicted within the Heavy Quark Expansion as the decay of a free bottom quark plus corrections which are suppressed by powers of $1/m_b$. This contribution to Loops&amp;Legs 2024 describes the calculation of the NNLO QCD corrections to nonleptonic decays of a free bottom quark including charm quark mass effects. In particular it outlines the challenges in connection to the computation of master integrals, the renormalization of the effective operators and the problems which arise from calculating traces with $\gamma_5$ in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Portal Spin-1 Dark Matter with Parity-Violating Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the spin-1 $U(1)_X$ gauged field $X$ with $Z_2$ odd dark parity for evading the current strong constraints for the kinetic mixing. Then, $X$ becomes stable and a candidate for the dark matter. The lowest mass dimension of interaction is six, and the type is like Higgs portal. Two types of dim-6 operators are introduced. We consider the freeze-out dark matter scenario. With the limit of null momentum transfer, a parity odd operator is free from the direct detection constraints. Accordingly, the strong constraints on a parity even operator indicate turning on this parity odd operator to realize the dark matter relic density of the universe. With the 1 TeV cut-off scale, our dark matter of around 400 GeV mass can explain the dark matter relic density and is allowed from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment of the direct detection.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter in Quantum Electromagnetodynamics and Detection at Haloscope Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultralight dark photon is one of intriguing dark matter candidates. The interaction between the visible photon and dark photon is introduced by the gauge kinetic mixing between the field strength tensors of the Abelian gauge groups in the Standard Model and dark sector. The relativistic electrodynamics was generalized to quantum electromagnetodynamics (QEMD) in the presence of both electric and magnetic charges. The photon is described by two four-potentials corresponding to two $U(1)$ gauge groups and satisfying non-trivial commutation relations. In this work, we construct the low-energy dark photon-photon interactions in the framework of QEMD and obtain new dark photon-photon kinetic mixings. The consequent field equations and the new Maxwell's equations are derived in this framework. We also investigate the detection strategies of dark photon as light dark matter as well as the generic kinetic mixings at haloscope experiments.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection constraints on semi-annihilation of inert scalar multiplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain models of inert multiplets allow for semi-annihilation processes, in which two dark matter candidates annihilate to a dark matter particle and a non-dark matter particle. The existence of these processes can alleviate certain constraints and substantially modify the indirect detection signal. In this paper, we study current indirect detection constraints on the semi-annihilation of inert scalar multiplets. We show that there exist gauge numbers for which dark matter can be thermally produced and be compatible with indirect detection constraints even for very cuspy galactic dark matter density profiles.</description>

      <title>Gemini Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $S_8/\sigma_8$ tension in the large scale structure can be explained by decaying dark matter with an almost degenerate spectrum and small enough decay width. Here we propose the Gemini dark matter model, which contains a heavy mother particle $\chi_3$ and two twins $\chi_{1/2}$ which are almost degenerate in mass and are produced at the same time. The dark sector is charged under the same Froggatt-Nielsen symmetry that can explain the hierarchy of the Standard model Yukawa couplings. The slightly heavier $\chi_2$ decays into $\chi_1$ and the axionic component of the flavon, which washes out the small scale structure and resolves $S_8/\sigma_8$ tension. We present the production mechanism of Gemini dark matter and viable parameter regions. We find that despite the preferred dark matter mass being $\mathcal{O}(1)$--$\mathcal{O}(100)$ keV, they constitute cold dark matter. The Gemini dark matter model predicts an abundance of dark radiation that will be probed in future measurements of the CMB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vector meson-baryon interaction in a coupled channel scheme is revisited within the correlation function framework. As illustrative cases to reveal the important role played by the coupled channels, we focus on the $\phi$p and $\rho^0$p systems given their complex dynamics and the presence of quasi-bound states or resonances in the vicinity of their thresholds. We show that the $\phi$p femtoscopic data provide novel information about a $N^*$ state present in the experimental region and anticipate the relevance of a future $\rho^0$p correlation function measurement in order to pin down the $S=0, Q=+1$ vector meson-baryon interaction as well as to disclose the characterizing features of the $N^*(1700)$ state.</description>

      <title>Probing leptophobic dark sector with a pseudoscalar portal in the NA64 experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possibility of discovering a light pseudoscalar particle $a$, which could the axion or an axion-like particle (ALP), interacting mainly with quarks using the electron and photon scattering reaction chain $e + Z \rightarrow e + \gamma + Z$; $\gamma + Z \rightarrow a + Z$ on nuclei in the NA64 experiment at the CERN SPS. New bounds on the coupling strengths of the axion/ALP with quarks and of pseudoscalar mesons $P = \pi, \eta, \eta'$ with dark fermions are obtained by using existing upper bounds on invisible decay modes of $P$s including those recently derived by NA64. We also study a scenario when the $a$ plays the role of a messenger in the communication between our world and the dark sector.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interactions of the $(\bar{c}q)(\bar{c}q)$/$(ccq)(\bar{c}q)$/$(ccq)(ccq)$ di-hadron systems based on a contact lagrangian possessing the SU(3) flavor and SU(2) spin symmetries. Under the assumptions of two scenarios for the $J^P$ quantum numbers of the $P_{\psi}^N(4440)$ and $P_{\psi}^N(4457)$ states, we obtain the parameters ($\tilde{g}_s$, $\tilde{g}_a$) introduced from this contact lagrangian. Then we include the SU(3) breaking effect by introducing a factor $g_x$, this quantity can be further constrained by the experimental mass of the $P_{\psi s}^\Lambda(4338)$ state. We can reproduce the mass of the $T^f_{cc}(3875)$ state with the parameters extracted from the observed $P_{\psi}^N$ states, this consistency indicates a unified description of the di-hadron molecular states composed of two heavy-light hadrons. With the same parameters, we discuss the possible mass spectra of the $\bar{T}_{cc}^f$/$P_{\psi c}^\Lambda$/$H_{\Omega_{ccc}c}^\Lambda$ systems. Then we proceed to discuss the existences of the $\bar{T}_{cc\bar{s}}^\theta$/$P_{\psi cs}^N$/$H_{\Omega_{ccc}cs}^N$ states by investigating the SU(3) breaking effects. Our results show that the states in the $\bar{T}_{cc\bar{s}}^\theta$/$P_{\psi cs}^N$ systems can hardly form bound states, while the states in the $H_{\Omega_{ccc}cs}^N$ system can form bound states due to their larger reduced masses.</description>

      <title>Higgs Decay to $Z\gamma$ in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and Its Nonholomorphic Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of $ h \rightarrow Z \gamma $ from CMS and ATLAS indicate an excess over Standard Model (SM) predictions, suggesting the presence of new physics. In this work, we investigate the $ h \rightarrow Z \gamma $ decay within the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and its nonholomorphic extension, the NHSSM. Calculations are performed using the FeynArts/FormCalc setup, utilizing the pre-existing model file for MSSM and generating the NHSSM model file with the support of {\tt SARAH}. In the allowed parameter space, MSSM contributions to $h \rightarrow Z \gamma$ can significantly surpass SM predictions reaching to the value $\Gamma(h \rightarrow Z \gamma)= 9.77 \times 10^{-6} \text{GeV}$, thereby bringing $ \Gamma (h \rightarrow Z \gamma) $ closer to the experimental value. The SM predicted value deviates from the experimental value by $1.7 \sigma$. However, the MSSM contributions can reduce this deviation to less than $1 \sigma$. In contrast, NHSSM contributions remain negligible and do not produce sizable corrections to the $ h \rightarrow Z \gamma $ decay width.</description>

      <title>Elastic scattering at $\sqrt{s} = 6$ GeV up to $ \sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV (proton-proton; proton-antiproton; proton-neutron)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the Regge-eikonal model of hadron interaction, based on the analyticity of the scattering amplitude with taking into account the hadron structure, the simultaneous analysis is carried out of the 90 sets of data. These sets include the data obtained at low energies ($\sqrt{s} &gt; 3.6 $ GeV and at high energies at FNAL, ISR, $S\bar{p}pS$, TEVATRON and LHC with 4326 experimental points, including the polarization data of analysing power. The energy and momentum transfer dependence of separate sets of data is analyzed on the basis of the eikonalized Born amplitude with taking into account two additional anomalous terms. Different origins of the nonlinear behavior of the slope of the scattering amplitude are compared. No contribution of hard-Pomeron in the elastic hadron scattering is shown. However, the importance of Odderon's contribution is presented. The form and energy dependence of different terms of the cross-even and cross-odd parts of the elastic nucleon-nucleon scattering amplitude is determined in the framework of the High Energy Generalize Structure (HEGS) model. In the framework of the HEGS model, using the electromagnetic and gravitomagnetic form factors, the differential cross sections in the Coulomb Nuclear Interference (CNI) region and at large momentum transfer are described well in a wide energy region simultaneously. It is shown that the cross-even part includes the soft pomeron growing like $\ln^{2}(s)$ and an additional term with a large slope and with and with energy dependence $\ln^2(s)$. The cross-odd part includes the maximal odderon term and an additional oscillation term with $\ln(s)$. It is shown that both additional terms are proportional to charge distributions but the maximal odderon term is proportional to matter distributions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous triple gauge couplings in $e^-e^+\to 4j$: Role of polarizations, spin correlations and interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anomalous charged triple gauge boson couplings generated via $SU(2)_l\times U(1)_Y$ gauge invariant dimension-6 operators with final state four jet events in an $e^-e^+$ Collider at $\sqrt{s}=250$~GeV. We consider all the leading order contributions including the contribution from the interference of $W^-W^+$ diagrams with other possible diagrams. The tagging of two $W$ bosons with a pair of jets is done using the jet charge, while the decay products of $W^\prime$s are tagged as \emph{up/down}-type using boosted decision trees to construct polarizations and spin correlations. Marginalized limits on five anomalous couplings are obtained by Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using polarizations, spin correlations, and cross~section. We found that the full-hadronic channel provides tighter limits on anomalous couplings than compared to the usually sought-after clean semi-leptonic channel, owing to the large contribution from interference.</description>

      <title>Effects of saturation and fluctuating hotspots for flow observables in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of saturation dynamics on midrapidity flow observables by adding fluctuating hotspots into the novel Monte Carlo EKRT (MC-EKRT) event generator for high-energy nuclear collisions. We demonstrate that the intensity of the saturation effects significantly affects the ratio between the flow coefficients $v_3$ and $v_2$ at the LHC. Adding a hotspot substructure to the nucleons enhances the saturation effects and improves the agreement with the measured data. We show that the collision-energy dependence of the flow coefficients obtained using the MC-EKRT initial states with hotspots is improved in comparison with the earlier event-by-event EKRT model. In addition, we present the results for the charged hadron multiplicity distribution in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, and show that the minijet-multiplicity originating fluctuations of the saturation scale included in MC-EKRT, as well as the presence of hotspots, are necessary for describing the measured large-multiplicity tail in the distribution.</description>

      <title>Search for Charged Higgs Bosons through Vector-Like Top Quark Pair Production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the production and decay of a vector-like top partner ($T$) with charge ${2}/{3}$ within the Two Higgs Doublet Model Type II (2HDM-II) extended by a vector-like quark (VLQ) doublet ($TB$). This study focuses on the decay sequence where the $T$ quark produces a charged Higgs boson ($H^+$) and a bottom quark, followed by the $H^+$ decay into a top and bottom quark, due to the small branching ratio for $H^+ \to \tau\nu$ in the studied region. Previous research \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.055016}{[Phys.Rev.D109,055016]} has shown that the decay pathway $T \to H^+b$ followed by $H^+ \to tb$ is dominant across a significant portion of the parameter space. We analyze the collider process $pp \to T\bar{T} \to (bH^+)(\bar{b}H^-) \to (b(tb))(\bar{b}(\bar{t}b))$, resulting in final states enriched with bottom quarks. Our findings highlight this channel as a promising avenue for discovering the new top partner and charged Higgs boson, offering substantial detection potential across a broad parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the production of a Standard-Model (SM) Higgs boson in gluon fusion in hadronic collisions and compute the QCD corrections up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and match them to parton showers (NNLO+PS). The complete dependence on the top-quark mass is taken into account without making any approximations to the top quark loops mediating the coupling between the gluons and the Higgs boson. To this end, we have included the $gg\to H$ amplitudes up to three loops and the $pp\to H$+jet amplitudes up to two loops in the full SM theory. This is the first fully differential calculation of the top-quark mass effects up to NNLO in QCD, and we study their impact on relevant observables for the LHC.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Belle data on the $K^- p$ mass distribution of the $\Lambda_c^+ \to p K^- \pi^+$ reaction near the $\eta \Lambda$ threshold to determine the $\eta \Lambda $ scattering length and effective range. We show that from these data alone we can determine the value of $a$ with better precision than so far determined, and the value of $r_0$ for the first time. The addition of the $K^- p \to \eta \Lambda$ data allows us to improve the precision of these magnitudes, with errors smaller than $15\%$. We also determine with high precision the pole position of the $\Lambda(1670)$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling desert region in inert doublet model assisted by Peccei-Quinn symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Inert Higgs Doublet model (IDM), assisted by Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, offers a simple but natural framework of a dark sector that accommodates Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) and axion as dark matter components. Spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry, which was originally proposed as an elegant solution to the strong charge-parity (CP) problem, also ensures the stability of WIMP through a residual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Interestingly, additional fields necessitated by PQ symmetry further enrich the dark sector. These include a scalar field proprietor for axion DM and a vector-like quark (VLQ) that acts as a portal for the dark sector through Yukawa interactions. Moreover, this combination of the axion and WIMP components satisfies the observed DM relic density and reopens the phenomenologically exciting region of the IDM parameter space where the WIMP mass falls between 100 - 550 GeV. We investigate the model-independent pair production of VLQs exploring this region at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), incorporating the effects of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections. After production, each VLQ decays into a top or bottom quark accompanied by an inert scalar, a consequence of the residual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Utilising relevant observables with a leptonic search channel and employing multivariate analysis, we demonstrate the ability of this analysis to exclude a significant portion of the parameter space with an integrated luminosity of 300 $\text{fb}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Bounds to strong gravity from electron-positron annihilations near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss bounds to strong gravity arising from annihilation of electron and positrons and the corresponding enhancement of the cross section for the production of massive particles. Two complementary examples are discussed, the case of the $e^+e^- \to W^+ W^-$ processes, with maximum mass and short lifetime for the particle pairs in the final state, and the case of electron positron annihilation into heavier charged lepton pairs, $e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $e^+ e^- \to \tau^+ \tau^-$. These bounds may be improved by the next generation of electron-positron colliders, and are complementary to bounds arising from direct graviton searches.</description>

      <title>Quark-Hadron Duality Violations and Higher-Order $1/m_b$ Corrections in Inclusive Semileptonic $B$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical description and data for inclusive semileptonic $B$ decays have reached incredible precision. This motivated us to re-animate the discussion of possible Quark-Hadron Duality violations. There seems that there is currently no evidence of a failure of the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) used to compute observables for these decays. However, we might arrive at a point where an asymptotic behaviour of the HQE would limit a further increase of precision. We discuss this possibility and suggest a simple model, which can be used to study the effects of higher orders in the $1/m_b$ expansion and possible quark-hadron duality violations. We devise observables sensitive only to such higher-order effects to test the behaviour of the HQE. Using these observables we obtain a first estimate of possible quark-hadron duality violations using the measured $q^2$ moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have left an imprint in the form of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) throughout their evolution in the history of the Universe. This review highlights two types of SGWB: those generated by scalar curvature perturbations associated with PBH formation in the early Universe and those composed of ensembles of GWs emitted by PBH binaries. After describing detection methods and a brief introduction on Bayesian inference, we discuss current constraints imposed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observations through the non-detection of the SGWBs and discuss their physical implications.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Calculation of $x$-dependent Meson Distribution Amplitudes at Physical Pion Mass with Threshold Logarithm Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the $x$-dependent pion and kaon distribution amplitudes (DA) in the framework of large momentum effective theory. This calculation is performed on a fine lattice of $a=0.076$~fm at physical pion mass, with the pion boosted to $1.8$~GeV and kaon boosted to $2.3$~GeV. We renormalize the matrix elements in the hybrid scheme and match to $\overline{\rm MS}$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the Wilson-line mass. The perturbative matching is improved by resumming the large logarithms related to the small quark and gluon momenta in the soft-gluon limit. After resummation, we demonstrate that we are able to calculate a range of $x\in[x_0,1-x_0]$ with $x_0=0.25$ for pion and $x_0=0.2$ for kaon with systematics under control. The kaon DA is shown to be slighted skewed, and narrower than pion DA. Although the $x$-dependence cannot be direct calculated beyond these ranges, we estimate higher moments of the pion and kaon DAs {by complementing} our calculation with short-distance factorization.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the detection of very-high-energy pulsars with LHAASO and SWGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsations from the Crab pulsar have been detected by the MAGIC telescopes at energies up to 1.5 TeV, and the pulsed emission from the Vela pulsar was detected by H.E.S.S., reaching tens of TeV. These discoveries, along with the proposed additional emission due to inverse Compton scattering at TeV energies, lead us to consider suitable candidates for detection with current and future extensive air show (EAS) experiments at very-high-energy (VHE; 0.1 $-$ 100 TeV) ranges. Leveraging energy spectrum data from pulsars as observed by Fermi and Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and considering the sensitivities of both LHAASO and SWGO, this study evaluates their detectability and estimates the time required for their significant detection. Our results indicate that LHAASO could detect the Crab's pulsed signal within six years, while SWGO might detect Vela's signal within one year. Observations of the most energetic Fermi pulsars with EAS experiments will provide insight into the nature of VHE pulsar emissions, helping to clarify the primary characteristics of VHE pulsars.</description>

      <title>Even- and odd-parity stabilities of black holes in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether theories with a timelike unit vector field, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric black holes against both even- and odd-parity perturbations. For this purpose, we formulate a gauge-invariant black hole perturbation theory in the background Aether-orthogonal frame where the spacelike property of hypersurfaces orthogonal to the timelike Aether field is always maintained even inside the metric horizon. Using a short-wavelength approximation with large radial and angular momenta, we show that, in general, there are three dynamical degrees of freedom arising from the even-parity sector besides two propagating degrees of freedom present in the odd-parity sector. The propagation speeds of even-parity perturbations and their no-ghost conditions coincide with those of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations on the Minkowski background, while the odd sector contains tensor and vector modes with the same propagation speeds as those in the even-parity sector (and hence as those on the Minkowski background). Thus, the consistent study of black hole perturbations in the Aether-orthogonal frame on static and spherically symmetric backgrounds does not add new small-scale stability conditions to those known for the Minkowski background in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of covariantly constant gauge fields is infinite-dimensional and describes non-perturbative solutions of the Yang-Mills equation of superposed chromomagnetic flux tubes (vortices) of opposite magnetic charges. These gauge field configurations are stretched along the potential valleys of a constant energy density and are separated by potential barriers between classically degenerate vacua that are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of dense chromomagnetic vortices representing a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor.</description>

      <title>The evolution and detection of vector superradiant instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight vectors can extract energy and angular momentum from a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability, resulting in the formation of a BH-condensate system. In this work, we carefully investigate the evolution of this system numerically with multiple superradiant modes. Simple formulas are obtained to estimate important timescales, maximum masses of different modes, as well as the BH mass and spin at various times. Due to the coexistence of modes with small frequency differences, the BH-condensate system emits gravitational waves with a unique beat signature, which could be directly observed by current and projected interferometers. Besides, the current BH spin-mass data from the binary BH merger events already excludes the vector mass in the range $5\times 10^{-15}\ \mathrm{eV} &lt;\mu&lt; 9\times 10^{-12}\ \mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Polarisability of Octet Baryons via Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing on recent advances in lattice-QCD background-field techniques, the magnetic polarisability of octet baryons is calculated from the first principles of QCD. The results are presented in the context of new constituent quark-model calculations providing a framework for understanding the lattice results and a direct comparison with simulation results at unphysical quark masses. Using smeared quark sources, low-lying Laplacian eigenmode projection and final-state Landau mode projection, considerable attention is devoted to ensuring single-state isolation in the lattice correlation functions. We also introduce new weighting methods to reduce the sensitivity to correlation-function fits, averaging over many fits based on merit drawn from the full correlated $\chi^2$ of the fits. The techniques are implemented on the $32^3 \times 64$, 2+1-flavour dynamical-fermion lattices provided by the PACS-CS collaboration following the introduction of uniform magnetic fields quantised to the lowest nontrivial values available. After some fine tuning of the constituent quark model parameters, we find the model captures the patterns observed in the lattice QCD results very well, providing important insights into the physics underpinning the magnetic polarisabilities. Finally, comparison with the most recent results from experiment proceeds through an effective field theory formalism which incorporates estimates of finite-volume corrections and small electro-quenching corrections as the results are brought to the physical point. We find excellent agreement with experiment where available, including the proton and neutron polarisabilities.</description>

      <title>Combining pre- and post-recombination new physics to address cosmological tensions: case study with varying electron mass and a sign-switching cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega_m$ in this sense.</description>

Abstract: Various gravity theories beyond general relativity have been rigorously investigated in the literature such as Horndeski and degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. In general, numerous model parameters are involved in such theories, which should be constrained to test the theories with experiments and observations. We construct the kurtosis consistency relations, calculated based on matter density fluctuations, in which the information of gravity theories is encoded. We derive two independent consistency relations that should hold in the framework of the DHOST theories and argue that such consistency relations would be useful for testing gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We describe an attempt of string theoretic derivation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy. Despite not admitting a de Sitter vacuum, the string theory, by the power of open-close correspondence, captures the Gibbons-Hawking entropy as the entropy of Chan-Paton species on a de Sitter-like state obtained via $D$-branes. Moreover, this derivation sheds a new light at the origin of the area-form, since the equality takes place for a critical 't Hooft coupling for which the species entropy of open strings saturates the area-law unitarity bound.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.13986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general, anomaly free U$(1)^\prime$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) where the neutrino mass is generated at the tree level via the inverse seesaw mechanism. The model contains three right handed neutrinos, three additional singlet fermions, one extra complex scalar and a neutral gauge boson $(Z^\prime)$. Instead of resorting to a specific $U(1)$ extension, we consider a class of models by taking the $U(1)^\prime$ charges of the scalars to be free parameters. Here, we assign one pair of the pseudo-Dirac degenerate sterile neutrinos as Dark Matter (DM) candidates which are produced by the freeze-in mechanism. Considering different mass regimes of the DM, $Z^\prime$ and reheating temperature, we obtain constraints on the $U(1)^\prime$ charges giving the correct relic abundance. We have also obtained constraints on $Z^\prime$ mass and coupling from consideration of relic density as well as high energy collider experiments like ATLAS in case of heavy $Z^\prime$ or in intensity and lifetime frontier experiments like DUNE, FASERs, and ILC beam dump which are looking for light $Z^\prime$. Additionally, in this model, the decay of pseudo-Dirac DM into active neutrinos can explain the 511 keV line observed by the INTEGRAL satellite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes involving multiple partons are plagued with infrared singularities. The soft singularities of the amplitude are captured by the soft function which is defined as the vacuum expectation value of Wilson line correlators. Renormalization properties of soft function allows us to write it as an exponential of the finite soft anomalous dimension. An efficient way to study the soft function is through a set of Feynman diagrams known as Cwebs (webs). We present the mixing matrices and exponentiated colour factors (ECFs) for the Cwebs at five loops that connect six Wilson lines, except those that are related by relabeling of Wilson lines. Further, we express these ECFs in terms of 29 basis colour factors. We also find that this basis can be categorized into two colour structures. Our results are the first key ingredients for the calculation of the soft anomalous dimension at five loops.</description>

      <title>Fate of homogeneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter, if represented by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field, can manifest as both particles and condensates. In this paper, we study the evolution of an oscillating homogeneous condensate of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field in a thermal plasma in an FLRW universe. We focus on the perturbative regime where the oscillation amplitude is sufficiently small so that parametric resonance is inefficient. This perturbative regime necessarily comprises the late stage of the condensate decay and determines its fate. The coupled coarse-grained equations of motion for the condensate, radiation, and spacetime are derived from first principles using nonequilibrium quantum field theory. We obtain analytical expressions for the relevant microscopic quantities that enter the equations of motion and solve the latter numerically. We find that there is always a nonvanishing relic abundance for a condensate with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is not spontaneously broken. This is because its decay rate decreases faster than the Hubble parameter at late times due to either the amplitude dependence or the temperature dependence in the condensate decay rate. Consequently, accounting for the condensate contribution to the overall dark matter relic density is essential for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ scalar singlet dark matter.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal kinematic imbalances in neutrino and antineutrino interactions for improved measurements of neutrino energy and the axial vector form factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current and future accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments require an improved understanding of nuclear effects in neutrino-nucleus interactions. One important systematic uncertainty is introduced by the collective impact of nuclear effects which bias the reconstruction of the neutrino energy, such as the nuclear removal energy. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel observable for accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments, the visible longitudinal momentum imbalance, reconstructed in charged current quasi-elastic interactions from the outgoing charged lepton and nucleon. We demonstrate it to be minimally dependent on the neutrino energy and sensitive to sources of bias in neutrino energy reconstruction. Furthermore, we show how the use of the longitudinal imbalance in antineutrino interactions in a target containing hydrogen allows for an improved, high-purity selection of the interactions on hydrogen. This approach offers the potential for precise measurements of the nuclear axial vector form factor as well as of the antineutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes of Massive Spin-2 Kaluza-Klein States with Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the scattering of matter and gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes in five-dimensional gravity theories. We consider matter localized on a brane as well as in the bulk of the extra dimension for scalars, fermions and vectors respectively, and consider an arbitrary warped background. While naive power-counting suggests that there are amplitudes which grow as fast as ${\cal O}(s^3)$ [where $s$ is the center-of-mass scattering energy-squared], we demonstrate that cancellations between the various contributions result in a total amplitude which grows no faster than ${\cal O}(s)$. Extending previous work on the self-interactions of the gravitational KK modes, we show that these cancellations occur due to sum-rule relations between the couplings and the masses of the modes that can be proven from the properties of the mode equations describing the gravity and matter wavefunctions. We demonstrate that these properties are tied to the underlying diffeomorphism invariance of the five-dimensional theory. We discuss how our results generalize when the size of the extra dimension is stabilized via the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. Our conclusions are of particular relevance for freeze-out and freeze-in relic abundance calculations for dark matter models including a spin-2 portal arising from an underlying five-dimensional theory.</description>

      <title>Extending Global Fits of 4D Composite Higgs Models with Partially Composite Leptons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first convergent Bayesian global fits of 4D Composite Higgs Models with partially-composite third generation quarks and leptons based on the minimal $SO(5) \rightarrow SO(4)$ symmetry breaking pattern. We consider two models with the $\tau$ lepton and its associated neutrino in different representations of $SO(5)$. Fitting each model with a wide array of experimental constraints allows us to analyse the Bayesian evidence and currently-observed fine-tuning of each model by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence between their respective priors and posteriors. Notably both models are found to be capable of satisfying all constraints simultaneously at the $3\sigma$ level at scales of $&lt; 5$ TeV. From a Bayesian viewpoint of naturalness the model with leptons in the $\mathbf{14}$ and $\mathbf{10}$ representations is preferred over those in the $\mathbf{5}$ representation due to its lower fine-tuning. Finally, we consider the experimental signatures for the preferred parameters in these models, including lepton partner decay signatures and gluon-fusion produced Higgs signal strengths, and discuss their potential phenomenology at future high-luminosity LHC runs.</description>

      <title>Flavoured Majorana Dark Matter then and now: From freeze-out scenarios to LHC signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a simplified Dark Matter model in the Dark Minimal Flavour Violation framework. Our model complements the Standard Model with a flavoured Dark Matter Majorana triplet and a coloured scalar mediator that share a Yukawa coupling with the right-handed up-type quarks with the coupling matrix $\lambda$. We extend previous work on this topic by exploring a large range of cosmologically viable parameter space, including the coannihilation region and, in particular, the region of conversion-driven freeze-out, while considering constraints from $D^0-\bar D^0$ mixing as well as constraints from direct and indirect Dark Matter searches. We find various realisations of conversion-driven freeze-out within the model, that open up allowed windows of parameter space towards small mass splittings and very weak Dark Matter couplings. Finally, we probe the model by reinterpreting current LHC searches for missing energy and long-lived particles. We point out gaps in the coverage of current constraints as well as new opportunities to search for the model at the LHC, in particular, the charge asymmetry in single-top production associated with jets and missing energy.</description>

      <title>Constraining MeV to 10 GeV majoron by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint on the majoron in the mass range between $1\,{\rm MeV}$ to $10\,{\rm GeV}$ which dominantly decays into the standard model neutrinos. When the majoron lifetime is shorter than $1\,{\rm sec}$, the injected neutrinos mainly heat up background plasma, which alters the relation between photon temperature and background neutrino temperature. For a lifetime longer than $1\,{\rm sec}$, most of the injected neutrinos directly contribute to the protons-to-neutrons conversion. In both cases, deuterium and helium abundances are enhanced, while the constraint from the deuterium is stronger than that from the helium. $^7{\rm Li}$ abundance gets decreased as a consequence of additional neutrons, but the parameter range that fits the observed $^7{\rm Li}$ abundance is excluded by the deuterium constraint. We also estimate other cosmological constraints and compare them with the BBN bound.</description>

      <title>From Optimal Observables to Machine Learning: an Effective-Field-Theory Analysis of $e^+e^- \to W^+W^-$ at Future Lepton Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply machine-learning techniques to the effective-field-theory analysis of the $e^+e^- \to W^+W^-$ processes at future lepton colliders, and demonstrate their advantages in comparison with conventional methods, such as optimal observables. Compared to traditional algorithms, we show that simulation-based inference methods are more robust to detector effects and backgrounds, and could in principle produce unbiased results with sufficient Monte Carlo simulation samples that accurately describe experiments. This is crucial for the analyses at future lepton colliders given the outstanding precision of the $e^+e^- \to W^+W^-$ measurement ($\sim 10^{-4}$ in terms of anomalous triple gauge couplings or even better) that can be reached. Our framework can be generalized to other effective-field-theory analyses, such as the one of $e^+e^- \to t\bar{t}$ or similar processes at muon colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a simultaneous global analysis of hadron fragmentation functions (FFs) to various charged hadrons at next-to-leading order in QCD. The world data set includes results from electron-positron single-inclusive annihilation, semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, as well as proton-proton collisions including jet fragmentation measurements which lead to strong constraints on the gluon fragmentations. By carefully selecting hadron kinematics to ensure the validity of QCD factorization and the convergence of perturbative calculations, we achieve a satisfying best fit with $\chi^2/$d.o.f.$=0.90$, in the simultaneous extraction of FFs for light charged hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$ and $p/\bar{p}$). The total momentum of $u$, $d$ quarks and gluon carried by light charged hadrons have been determined precisely. That urges future precision measurements on fragmentation to neutral hadrons, which are crucial for the test of fundamental sum rules in QCD fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Mono-Higgs and Mono-$Z$ Production in the Minimal Vector Dark Matter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minimal Vector Dark Matter is a viable realization of the minimal dark matter paradigm. It extends the Standard Model by the inclusion of a vector matter field in the adjoint representation of $SU (2)_L$. The dark matter candidate corresponds to the neutral component of the new vector field ($V^0$). Previous studies have shown that the model can explain the observed dark matter abundance while evading direct and indirect searches. At colliders, the attention has been put on the production of the charged companions of the dark matter candidate. In this work, we focus on the mono-Higgs and mono-$Z$ signals at hadron colliders. The new charged vectors ($V^{\pm}$) are invisible unless a dedicated search is performed. Consequently, we assume that the mono-Higgs and mono-$Z$ processes correspond the $pp\rightarrow h V^{+,0} V^{-,0}$ and $pp\rightarrow Z V^{+,0} V^{-,0}$ reactions, respectively. We show that, while the $p p \rightarrow h V^{+,0} V^{-,0}$ is more important, both channels may produce significant signals at the HL-LHC and colliders running at $\sqrt{s} = 27$ TeV and $100$ TeV, probing almost the complete parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We document several recent updates to the MCPLOTS event-generator validation resource. The project is based on the RIVET analysis library and harnesses volunteer computing provided by LHC@home to generate high-statistics MC comparisons to data. Users interact with the resource via a simple website, mcplots.cern.ch, which provides flexible options for requesting comparison plots and comprehensive statistical analyses on demand, all in a few clicks. The project has been structured to enable community-driven developments, and we discuss the computational back end, the web front end, and how to add new data analyses, generators, and tunes that would be accessible on the website for comparison.</description>

Abstract: We study the triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons with quark contents $ ccb $ and $ bbc $, and calculate their mass and residue using QCD sum rules. In the calculations, we consider the ground (1S), first orbitally excited (1P) and first radially excited (2S) states. Aiming to achieve higher accuracies in the results, we perform the computations by taking into account the non-perturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We compare our results with the predictions of other theoretical studies existing in the literature. The obtained results may help experimental groups in their search for these yet unseen, but previously predicted by the quark model, interesting particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present resummed predictions at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy matched to the exact next-to-leading order results for a set of classical event-shape observables in hadronic Higgs decays, i.e., for the channels $H\to gg$ and $H\to b\bar{b}$. We furthermore consider soft-drop grooming of the hadronic final states and derive corresponding $\text{NLO}+\text{NLL}^\prime$ predictions for the groomed thrust observable. Differences in the QCD radiation pattern of gluon- and quark-initiated final states are imprinted in the event-shape distributions, offering separation power for the two decay channels. In particular, we show that ungroomed event shapes in $H\to gg$ decays develop a considerably harder spectrum than in $H\to b\bar b$ decays. We highlight that soft-drop grooming can substantially alter this behaviour, unless rather inclusive grooming parameters are chosen.</description>

Abstract: Masses and current couplings of the charmonium and bottomonium hybrids $ \overline{c}gc$ and $\overline{b}gb$ with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=0^{++},\ 0^{+-},\ 0^{-+},\ 0^{--}$ and $1^{++},\ 1^{+-},\ 1^{-+},\ 1^{--}$ are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. Computations are performed by taking into account gluon condensates up to dimension 12 including terms $\sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2}$. The parameters of the bottom-charm hybrids $\overline{b}gc$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC }}=0^{+},\ 0^{-},\ 1^{+}$, and $1^{-}$ are calculated as well. In computations the dominance of the pole contribution to sum rule results is ensured. It is demonstrated that all charmonia hybrids decay strongly to two-meson final states. The bottomonium hybrids $0^{-+}$ and $1^{-+}$ as well as the bottom-charm hybrid mesons $0^{-(+)}$ and $1^{-(+)}$ may be stable against strong two-meson decay modes. Results of the present work are compared with ones obtained using the sum rule and alternative approaches. Our predictions for parameters of the heavy hybrid mesons may be useful to study their various decay channels which are important for interpretation of ongoing and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Role of hidden-color components in the tetraquark mixing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiquarks can have two-hadron components and hidden-color components in their wave functions. The presence of two-hadron components in multiquarks introduces a potential source of confusion, particularly with respect to their resemblance to hadronic molecules. On the other hand, hidden-color components are essential for distinguishing between multiquarks and hadronic molecules. In this work, we study the hidden-color components in the wave functions of the tetraquark mixing model, a model that has been proposed as a suitable framework for describing the properties of two nonets in the $J^P=0^+$ channel: the light nonet [$a_0 (980)$, $K_0^* (700)$, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0 (980)$] and the heavy nonet [$a_0 (1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$, $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0 (1500)$]. Our analysis reveals a substantial presence of hidden-color components within the tetraquark wave functions. To elucidate the impact of hidden-color components on physical quantities, we conduct computations of the hyperfine masses, $\langle V_{CS}\rangle$, for the two nonets, considering scenarios involving only the two-meson components and those incorporating the hidden-color components. We demonstrate that the hidden-color components constitute an important part of the hyperfine masses, such that the mass difference formula, $\Delta M\approx \Delta \langle V_{CS}\rangle$, which has been successful for the two nonets, cannot be achieved without the hidden-color contributions. This can provide another evidence supporting the tetraquark nature of the two nonets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong dynamics for composite Higgs models predict spin-1 resonances which are expected to be in the same mass range as the usually considered top-partners. We study here QCD-coloured vector and axial-vector states stemming from composite Higgs dynamics in several relevant models based on an underlying gauge-fermion description. These states can come as triplet, sextet and octet representation. All models considered have a colour octet vector state in common which can be singly produced at hadron colliders as it mixes with the gluon. We explore the rich and testable phenomenology of these coloured spin-1 states at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <title>String Junctions Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements at the LHC have revealed heavy-flavour baryon fractions much larger than those observed at LEP, with e.g., LambdaC+/D0 and LambdaB0/B0 reaching ~ 0.5 at low pT. One scenario that has been at least partly successful in predicting observed trends is QCD colour reconnections with string junctions. In previous work, however, the limit of a low-pT heavy quark was not well defined. We reconsider the string equations of motion for junction systems in this limit, and find that the junction effectively becomes bound to the heavy quark, a scenario we refer to as a "pearl on a string". We extend string-junction fragmentation in Pythia with a dedicated modelling of this limit for both light- and heavy-quark "pearls".</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion potential in two-flavor superconductive quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the potential of the axion, $a$, of Quantum Chromodynamics, in the two-flavor color superconducting phase of cold and dense quark matter. We adopt a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like model. Our interaction contains two terms, one preserving and one breaking the $U(1)_A$ symmetry: the latter is responsible of the coupling of axions to quarks. We introduce two quark condensates, $h_L$ and $h_R$, describing condensation for left-handed and right-handed quarks respectively; we then study the loci of the minima of the thermodynamic potential, $\Omega$, in the $(h_L,h_R)$ plane, noticing how the instanton-induced interaction favors condensation in the scalar channel when the $\theta-$angle, $\theta=a/f_a$, vanishes. Increasing $\theta$ we find a phase transition where the scalar condensate rotates into a pseudo-scalar one. We present an analytical result for the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, in the superconductive phase, which stands both at zero and at finite temperature. Finally, we compute the axion mass and its self-coupling. In particular, the axion mass $m_a$ is related to the full topological susceptibility via $\chi=m_a^2 f_a^2$, hence our result for $\chi$ gives an analytical result for $m_a$ in the superconductive phase of high-density Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Opening a meV mass window for Axion-like particles with a microwave-laser-mixed stimulated resonant photon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a microwave-laser-mixed three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider, which enables access to axion-like particles in the meV mass range. Collisions between a focused pulse laser beam and a focused microwave pulse beam directly produce axion-like particles (ALPs) and another focused pulse laser beam stimulates their decay. The expected sensitivity in the meV mass range has been evaluated. The result shows that the sensitivity can reach the ALP-photon coupling down to $O(10^{-13})$ GeV${}^{-1}$ with $10^6$ shots if 10 -100 TW class high-intensity lasers are properly combined with a conventional 100 MW class S-band klystron. This proposal paves the way for identifying the nature of ALPs as candidates for dark matter, independent of any cosmological and astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Study some two loop contribution to muon MDM in the N-B-LSSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the muon magnetic dipole moment (MDM) has close relation with the new physics (NP) in the development of the Standard Model (SM). Combined with the Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) E821 result, the departure from the SM prediction is about 5.0 $\sigma$. We study the electroweak corrections from several type two-loop SUSY diagrams and the virtual SUSY particles include chargino, neutralino, scalar lepton and scalar neutrino. Based on the latest experimental constraints, we study the muon MDM under the next to the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with local B-L gauge symmetry (N-B-LSSM). The abundant numerical results verify that $\tan{\beta},~T_e,~M^2_L,~M^2_e,~M_{BB'}$ and $M^2_{eij}$ play an important role in muon MDM. $M^2_e,~\tan{\beta}$ and $T_e$ are sensitive parameters to muon MDM. From the data obtained in all the figures of the numerical results, most of the values of $a_{\mu}^{NBL}$ are in 2$\sigma$ interval, which can compensate the departure between the experiment data and the SM prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparison of three different general-purpose Monte Carlo event generators, Herwig, Pythia, and Sherpa, with respect to the simulation of photoproduction. We outline the default inputs, implementation differences and compare the results at different stages of the event generation. We find that, despite a similar starting point, the final cross sections do have some differences related to different non-perturbative inputs. We compare the simulations with experimental data for jet production in LEP and HERA and find that all generators provide a decent desription of the data within the considered uncertainties. We also present predictions for the upcoming EIC for jet observables and event shapes and conclude that accurate simulations will require further phenomenological advances.</description>

      <title>Color Coherence Effects in Dipole-Quark Scattering in the Soft Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color coherence effects play a crucial role in the description of jet evolution at collider experiments. It is well known that the stimulated gluon emission suffered by energetic jets traversing deconfined QCD matter is also affected by color coherence effects. Through multiple soft scatterings with the medium constituents, an antenna will lose its color correlation, causing its legs to behave as independent emitters after the so-called decoherence time. In this work we provide the first computation of the properties of the recoils produced as a result of these soft scatterings between a color coherent dipole and the medium constituents. Our findings reveal that the angular phase-space of these soft recoils is strongly restricted by the opening angle of the dipole itself due to quantum interference effects. In this long wavelength limit, one can effectively consider that interactions take place with each of the legs of the dipole separately, provided that the angular constraints dictated by the corresponding color flow topologies are respected. This is in complete analogy with the case of soft gluon emission in vacuum, where the recoil quark plays the role of the emitted gluon. As a direct phenomenological application we estimate the collisional energy loss rate of a color antenna. Importantly, these results indicate the way in which color coherence effects can be implemented in jet quenching models that account for the recoils from elastic scatterings, improving in this way our description of medium response physics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TNMSSM is an attractive extension of the Standard Model. It combines the advantages of the NMSSM and the TMSSM to give three tiny Majorana neutrinos masses via a type I+II seesaw mechanism. With the on-shell renormalization scheme, we consider the neutrino masses up to one loop approximation. Applying the effective Lagrangian method, we study the transition magnetic moments of Majorana neutrinos and consider the normal hierarchy (NH) and inverse hierarchy (IH) neutrino mass spectra within the constraints of experimental data on neutrino oscillations. The solar neutrino transition magnetic moment is further deduced, and compared with the XENONnT experiment limit.</description>

      <title>A determination of FL at xmin with HERA data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that there are persistent statistical tensions with the standard model in the low Q2 HERA deep inelastic scattering neutral current data characterized by a turn-over of F2(x, Q2) at low x and low Q2. One important experimental signature that sheds light on this low Q2 region is the determination of the longitudinal structure function FL(x, Q2). This paper describes a novel method to determine FL based on an extrapolation of the reduced NC cross section at fixed s and Q to the minimum value of x given by Q2/s. At this kinematic point, the reduced cross section equals 2xF1 = F2 - FL so that a determination of both this value and the value of F2, determines FL. Since the polarization of the exchanged photon is transverse at this kinematic point, we expect FL to be small because its dominate gluon component is strongly suppressed. Surprisingly, we find FL at low Q2 to be much larger than expectation and observe that both FL and F2 at x = Q2/s show several properties consistent with the dipole picture. We discuss the statistical as well as chief systematic errors of our method and we tabulate our determinations of F2, 2xF1 and FL in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Schwinger mechanism of magnon-antimagnon pair production on magnetic field inhomogeneities and the bosonic Klein effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective field theory of low-energy exitations-magnons that describes antiferromagnets is mapped into scalar electrodynamics of a charged scalar field interacting with an external electromagnetic potential. In the presence of a constant inhomogeneous external magnetic field the latter problem is technically reduced to the problem of charged-particle creation from the vacuum by an electric potential step (x step). Magnetic moment plays here the role of the electric charge, and magnons and antimagnons differ from each other in the sign of the magnetic moment. In the framework of such a consideration, it is important to take into account the vacuum instability (the Schwinger effect) under the magnon-antimagnon production on magnetic field inhomogeneities (an analog of pair creation from the vacuum by electric-like fields). We demonstrate how to use the strong field QED with x steps developed by the authors (SPG and DMG) to study the magnon-antimagnon pair production on magnetic field inhomogeneities. Characteristics of the vacuum instability obtained for some magnetic steps that allows exact solving the Klein-Gordon equation are presented. In particular, we consider examples of magnetic steps with very sharp field derivatives that correspond to a regularization of the Klein step. In the case of smooth-gradient steps, we describe an universal behavior of the flux density of created magnon pairs. We also note that since the low-energy magnons are bosons with small effective mass, then for the first time maybe the opportunity will arise to observe the Schwinger effect in the case of the Bose statistics, in particular, the bosonic Klein effect in laboratory conditions. Moreover, it turns out that in the case of the Bose statistics appears a new mechanism for amplifying the effect of the pair creation, which we call statistically assisted Schwinger effect.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Integration-By-Parts (IBP) and differential equations methods to de Sitter correlators related to inflation. While massive correlators in de Sitter spacetime are usually regarded as highly intricate, we find they have remarkably hidden concise structures from the perspective of IBP. We find the factorization of the IBP relations of each vertex integral family corresponding to $\mathrm{d} \tau_i$ integration. Furthermore, with a smart construction of master integrals, the universal formulas for iterative reduction and $\mathrm{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary vertex integral family are presented and proved. These formulas dominate all tree-level de Sitter correlators and play a kernel role at the loop-level as well.</description>

Abstract: We present the electromagnetic (EM) dipole radiation flux from an eccentric Keplerian binary endowed with scalar charges, in the presence of scalar-photon coupling $\phi A_\mu A^\mu$ or $\phi F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. The scalar radiation is suppressed for orbital frequency below the scalar mass, while the scalar-mediated indirect EM radiation survives. We examine the constraints imposed on the scalar-photon and scalar-charge couplings by the current observational data, in case that the scalar charge is given by the muon number. The extensions of our calculation to the quadrupole order and hyperbolic orbit are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A measurement of the sodium and iodine scintillation quenching factors across multiple NaI(Tl) detectors to identify systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amount of light produced by nuclear recoils in scintillating targets is strongly quenched compared to that produced by electrons. A precise understanding of the quenching factor is particularly interesting for WIMP searches and CE{\nu}NS measurements since both rely on nuclear recoils, whereas energy calibrations are more readily accessible from electron recoils. There is a wide variation among the current measurements of the quenching factor in sodium iodide (NaI) crystals, especially below 10 keV, the energy region of interest for dark matter and CE{\nu}NS studies. A better understanding of the quenching factor in NaI(Tl) is of particular interest for resolving the decades-old puzzle in the field of dark matter between the null results of most WIMP searches and the claim for dark matter detection by the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. In this work, we measured sodium and iodine quenching factors for five small NaI(Tl) crystals grown with similar thallium concentrations and growth procedures. Unlike previous experiments, multiple crystals were tested, with measurements made in the same experimental setup to control systematic effects. The quenching factors agree in all crystals we investigated, and both sodium and iodine quenching factors are smaller than those reported by DAMA/LIBRA. The dominant systematic effect was due to the electron equivalent energy calibration originating from the non-proportional behavior of the NaI(Tl) light yield at lower energies, potentially the cause for the discrepancies among the previous measurements.</description>
