      <title>Mathematical basis, phase transitions and singularities of (3+1)-dimensional phi4 scalar field model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lambda phi4 scalar field model can be applied to interpret pion-pion scattering and properties of hadrons. In this work, the mathematical basis, phase transitions and singularities of a (3+1)-dimensional (i.e., (3+1)D) phi4 scalar field model are investigated. It is found that as a specific example of topological quantum field theories, the (3+1)D phi4 scalar field model must be set up on the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner framework and dealt with the parameter space of complex time (or complex temperature). The use of the time average and the topologic Lorentz transformation representing Reidemeister moves ensure the integrability, which takes into account for the contributions of nontrivial topological structures to physical properties of the many-body interacting system. The ergodic hypothesis is violated at finite temperatures in the (3+1)D phi4 scalar field model. Because the quantum field theories with ultraviolet cutoff can be mapped to the models in statistical mechanics, the (3+1)D phi4 scalar field model with ultraviolet cutoff is studied by inspecting its relation with the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model. Furthermore, the direct relation between the coupling K in the 3D Ising model and the bare coupling lambda0 in the (3+1)D phi4 scalar field model is determined in the strong coupling limit. The results obtained in the present work can be utilized to investigate thermodynamic physical properties and critical phenomena of quantum (scalar) field theories.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of three-dimensional (3D) spinless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-dimensional (3D) Ising model is mapped into a 3D spinless fermionic model by the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The exact solution of the 3D model for spinless fermions is derived analytically by performing a diagonalization process consisting of the Clifford algebraic approach, the Fourier transformation and the Bogoliubov transformation. The Clifford algebraic approach is the same as that developed for the 3D Ising model, using a time average within the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner framework, a linearization procedure and a local gauge transformation. The formulas for eigenvalues, partition function, subsequent thermodynamic properties and critical behaviors are presented. The dimensionality and the topological phases are investigated. The present results for many spinless fermions in a 3D lattice are applicable for studying the mechanisms of magnetism, superfluid, superconductors and topological materials.</description>
