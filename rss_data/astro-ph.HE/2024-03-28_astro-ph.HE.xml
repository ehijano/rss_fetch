      <title>Optical variability of the blazar 3C 371: from minute to year timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BL Lac object 3C 371 has been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}) for approximately a year, between July 2019 and July 2020, with an unmatched 2-minute observing cadence. In parallel, the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration organized an extensive observing campaign, providing three years of continuous optical monitoring between 2018 and 2020. These datasets allow for a thorough investigation of the variability of the source. The goal of this study is evaluating the optical variability of 3C 371. Taking advantage of the remarkable cadence of \textit{TESS} data, we aim to characterize the intra-day variability (IDV) displayed by the source and identify its shortest variability timescale. With this estimate, constraints on the size of the emitting region and black hole mass can be calculated. Moreover, WEBT data is used to investigate long-term variability (LTV), including understanding spectral behaviour of the source and the polarization variability. Based on the derived characteristics, information on the origin of the variability on different timescales is extracted. We evaluated the variability applying the variability amplitude tool that quantifies how variable the emission is. Moreover, we employed common tools like ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAariance) tests, wavelet and power spectral density (PSD) analyses to characterize the shortest variability timescales present in the emission and the underlying noise affecting the data. Short- and long-term colour behaviours have been evaluated to understand the spectral behaviour of the source. The polarized emission was analyzed, studying its variability and possible rotation patterns of the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Flux distributions of IDV and LTV were also studied with the aim of linking the flux variations to turbulent and/or accretion disc related processes.</description>

      <title>Magnetars as Powering Sources of Gamma-Ray Burst Associated Supernovae, and Unsupervised Clustering of Cosmic Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the semi-analytical light curve modelling of 13 supernovae associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB-SNe) along with two relativistic broad-lined (Ic-BL) SNe without GRBs association (SNe 2009bb and 2012ap), considering millisecond magnetars as central-engine-based power sources for these events. The bolometric light curves of all 15 SNe in our sample are well-regenerated utilising a $\chi^2-$minimisation code, $\texttt{MINIM}$, and numerous parameters are constrained. The median values of ejecta mass ($M_{\textrm{ej}}$), magnetar's initial spin period ($P_\textrm{i}$) and magnetic field ($B$) for GRB-SNe are determined to be $\approx$ 5.2 M$_\odot$, 20.5 ms and 20.1 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ G, respectively. We leverage machine learning (ML) algorithms to comprehensively compare the 3-dimensional parameter space encompassing $M_{\textrm{ej}}$, $P_\textrm{i}$, and $B$ for GRB-SNe determined herein to those of H-deficient superluminous SNe (SLSNe-I), fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), long GRBs (LGRBs), and short GRBs (SGRBs) obtained from the literature. The application of unsupervised ML clustering algorithms on the parameters $M_{\textrm{ej}}$, $P_\textrm{i}$, and $B$ for GRB-SNe, SLSNe-I, and FBOTs yields a classification accuracy of $\sim$95%. Extending these methods to classify GRB-SNe, SLSNe-I, LGRBs, and SGRBs based on $P_\textrm{i}$ and $B$ values results in an accuracy of $\sim$84%. Our investigations show that GRB-SNe and relativistic Ic-BL SNe presented in this study occupy different parameter spaces for $M_{\textrm{ej}}$, $P_\textrm{i}$, and $B$ than those of SLSNe-I, FBOTs, LGRBs and SGRBs. This indicates that magnetars with different $P_\textrm{i}$ and $B$ can give birth to distinct types of transients.</description>

      <title>Thermonuclear explosions on neutron stars reveal the speed of their jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets are observed from accreting and cataclysmic transients throughout the Universe, and have a profound affect on their surroundings. Despite their importance, their launch mechanism is not known. For accreting neutron stars, the speed of their compact jets can reveal whether the jets are powered by magnetic fields anchored in the accretion flow or in the star itself, but to-date no such measurements exist. These objects can display bright explosions on their surface due to unstable thermonuclear burning of recently accreted material, called type-I X-ray bursts, during which the mass accretion rate increases. Here, we report on bright flares in the jet emission for a few minutes after each X-ray burst, attributed to the increased accretion rate. With these flares, we measure the speed of a neutron star compact jet to be $v=0.38^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$c, much slower than those from black holes at similar luminosities. This discovery provides a powerful new tool in which we can determine the role that individual system properties have on the jet speed, revealing the dominant jet launching mechanism.</description>

      <title>Recovery of High-energy Low-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations from Black Hole X-ray Binary MAXI J1535-571 with a Hilbert-Huang Transform Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method based on the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to recover the high-energy waveform of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs). Based on the method, we successfully obtain the modulation of the phase-folded light curve above 170 keV using the QPO phase reconstructed at lower energies in MAXI J1535-571 with Insight-HXMT observations. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted to demonstrate that such modulation indeed originates from the QPO. Thus the highest energies turn out to significantly exceed the upper limit of ~100 keV for QPOs reported previously using the Fourier method, marking the first opportunity to study QPO properties above 100 keV in this source. Detailed analyses of these high-energy QPO profiles reveal different QPO properties between the 30-100 keV and 100-200 keV energy ranges: the phase lag remains relatively stable, and the amplitude slightly increases below ~100 keV, whereas above this threshold, soft phase lags and a decrease in amplitude are observed. Given the reports of a hard tail detection in broad spectroscopy, we propose that the newly discovered QPO properties above 100 keV are dominated by the hard tail component, possibly stemming from a relativistic jet. Our findings also indicate a strong correlation between the QPOs originating from the jet and corona, supporting the scenario of jet-corona coupling precssion. We emphasize that our proposed HHT-based method can serve as an efficient manner in expanding the high energy band for studying QPOs, thereby enhancing our understanding of their origin.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of magnetized low angular momentum accretion flow around a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An essential factor in determining the flow characteristics of an accretion flow is its angular momentum. According to the angular momentum of the flow, semi-analytical analysis suggests various types of accretion solutions. It is critical to test it with numerical simulations using the most advanced framework available (general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics) to understand how flow changes with different angular momentum. By changing the initial condition of the accretion torus minimally, we can simulate steady, low angular momentum accretion flow around a Kerr black hole. We focus primarily on the lower limits of angular momentum and come upon that accretion flow with an intermediate range of angular momentum differs significantly from high or very low angular momentum flow. The intermediate angular momentum accretion flow has the highest density, pressure, and temperature near the black hole, making it easier to observe. We find that the density and pressure have power-law scalings $\rho\propto r^{n-3/2}$ and $p_g\propto r^{n-5/2}$ which only hold for very low angular momentum cases. With the increase in flow angular momentum, it develops a non-axisymmetric nature. In this case, simple self-similarity does not hold. We also find that the sonic surface moves away from the innermost stable circular orbit as its angular momentum decreases. Finally, we emphasize that intermediate angular momentum flow could provide a possible solution to explain the complex observation features of the supermassive black hole Sgr~A$^*$ at our galactic center.</description>

      <title>Fermi and eROSITA Bubbles as Persistent Structures of The Milky Way Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles, large diffuse structures in our Galaxy, can be the by-products of the steady star formation activity. To simultaneously explain the star formation history of the Milky Way and the metallicity of $\sim$ Z$_\odot$ at the Galactic disk, a steady Galactic wind driven by cosmic-rays is required. For tenuous gases with a density of $\lesssim$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, the cosmic-ray heating dominates over radiative cooling, and the gas can maintain the virial temperature of $\sim$0.3 keV ideal for escape from the Galactic system as the wind. A part of the wind falls back onto the disk like a galactic fountain flow. We model the wind dynamics according to the Galactic evolution scenario and find that the scale height and surface brightness of the X-ray and the hadronic gamma-ray emissions from such fountain flow region can be consistent with the observed properties of the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. This implies that the bubbles are persistent structures of the Milky Way existing over (at least) the last $\sim$1 Gyr, rather than evanescent structures formed by non-trivial, $\sim$10 Myr past Galactic Center transient activities.</description>

      <title>Stellar wind bubbles of OB stars as Galactic cosmic-ray re-accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are highly energetic messengers propagating in magnetized plasma, which are, possibly but not exclusively, accelerated at astrophysical shocks. Amongst the variety of astrophysical objects presenting shocks, the huge circumstellar stellar wind bubbles forming around very massive stars, are potential non thermal emitters. We present the 1D magnetohydrodynamical simulation of the evolving magnetized surroundings of a single, OB type main sequence 60 Mo star, which is post processed to calculate the re-acceleration of preexisting non-thermal particles of the Galactic cosmic ray background. It is found that the forward shock of such circumstellar bubble can, during the early phase (1 Myr) of its expansion, act as a substantial reaccelerator of pre existing interstellar cosmic rays. This results in an increasing excess emission flux by a factor of 5, the hadronic component producing gamma-rays by pion0 decay being more important than those by synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation mechanisms. We propose that this effect is at work in the circumstellar environments of massive stars in general and we conjecture that other nebulae such as the stellar wind bow shocks of runaway massive stars also act as Galactic cosmic-ray re-accelerators. Particularly, this study supports the interpretation of the enhanced hadronic emission flux measured from the surroundings of kappa Ori as originating from the acceleration of pre-existing particles at the forward shock of its wind bubble.</description>

      <title>The SZ effect with anisotropic distributions and high energy electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect promise ever improving measurements in terms of both sensitivity and angular resolution. As such, it is increasingly relevant to model `higher-order' contributions to the SZ effect. This work examines the effects of high-energy non-thermal electron distributions and those of anisotropic electron and photon distributions on the SZ signals. Analytic forms of the anisotropic scattering kernels for photons and electrons have been derived and investigated. We present a method for determining the anisotropic contributions through a spherical harmonic decomposition to arbitrary angular multipoles, and discuss the behaviour of these scattering kernels. We then carry out an exploration of various simplistic models of high energy non-thermal electron distributions, and examine their anisotropic behaviour. The kinematic SZ in the relativistic regime is studied using the kernel formulation allowing us to clarifying the role of kinematic corrections to the scattering optical depth. We finally present a release of an updated and refined version of SZpack including a new integrated Python interface and new modules for the calculation of various SZ signals, including those described in this paper.</description>

      <title>Supernova Archaeology with X-Ray Binary Winds -- The Case of GRO J1655-40</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae are responsible for the elemental enrichment of the galaxy and some are postulated to leave behind a black hole. In a stellar binary system the supernova pollutes its companion, and the black hole can accrete back its own debris and emit X-rays. In this sequence of events, which is only poorly understood, winds are ejected, and observed through X-ray absorption lines. Measuring abundances of elements in the wind can lead to inferences about the historical explosion and possibly identify the long-gone progenitor of the compact object. Here, we re-analyze the uniquely rich X-ray spectrum of the 2005 outburst of GRO J1655-40. We reconstruct the absorption measure distribution (AMD) of the wind, and find that it increases sharply with ionization from H-like O up to H-like Ca, and then flattens out. The AMD is then used to measure relative abundances of 18 different elements. The present abundances are in partial agreement with a previous work with discrepancies mostly for low-Z elements. The overabundance of odd-Z elements hints at a high-metallicity, high-mass ($\simeq25\,M_\odot$) progenitor. Interestingly, the abundances are different from those measured in the companion atmosphere, indicating that the wind entrains lingering ambient supernova debris. This can be expected since the current total stellar mass of the binary ($&lt;10\,M_\odot$) is much less than the progenitor mass.</description>

      <title>Identifying the electromagnetic counterparts of LISA massive black hole binaries in archival LSST data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will catalogue the light-curves of up to 100 million quasars. Among these there can be up to approximately 100 ultra-compact massive black hole (MBH) binaries, which 5-15 years later can be detected in gravitational waves (GWs) by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Here we assume that GWs from a MBH binary have been detected by LISA, and we assess whether or not its electromagnetic (EM) counterpart can be uniquely identified in archival LSST data as a periodic quasar. We use the binary's properties derived from the LISA waveform, such as the past evolution of its orbital frequency, its total mass, distance and sky localization, to predict the redshift, magnitude and historical periodicity of the quasar expected in the archival LSST data. We then use Monte Carlo simulations to compute the false alarm probability, i.e. the number of quasars in the LSST catalogue matching these properties by chance, based on the (extrapolated) quasar luminosity function, the sampling cadence of LSST, and intrinsic ``damped random walk (DRW)" quasar variability. We perform our analysis on four fiducial LISA binaries, with total masses and redshifts of $(M_{\rm bin}/{\rm M_{\odot}},z) = (3\times10^5,0.3)$, $(3\times10^6,0.3)$, $(10^7,0.3)$ and $(10^7,1)$. While DRW noise and aliasing due to LSST's cadence can produce false periodicities by chance, we find that the frequency chirp of the LISA source during the LSST observations washes out these noise peaks and allows the genuine source to stand out in Lomb-Scargle periodograms. We find that all four fiducial binaries yield excellent chances to be uniquely identified, with false alarm probabilities below $10^{-5}$, a week or more before their merger. This then enables deep follow-up EM observations targeting the individual EM counterparts during their inspiral stage.</description>

      <title>Long gamma-ray burst light curves as the result of a common stochastic pulse-avalanche process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The complexity and variety exhibited by the light curves of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) enclose a wealth of information that still awaits being fully deciphered. Despite the tremendous advance in the knowledge of the energetics, structure, and composition of the relativistic jet that results from the core collapse of the progenitor star, the nature of the inner engine, how it powers the relativistic outflow, and the dissipation mechanisms remain open issues. Aims. A promising way to gain insights is describing GRB light curves as the result of a common stochastic process. In the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) era, a stochastic pulse avalanche model was proposed and tested through the comparison of ensemble-average properties of simulated and real light curves. Here we aim to revive and further test this model. Methods. We apply it to two independent data sets, BATSE and Swift/BAT, through a machine learning approach: the model parameters are optimised using a genetic algorithm. Results. The average properties are successfully reproduced. Notwithstanding the different populations and passbands of both data sets, the corresponding optimal parameters are interestingly similar. In particular, for both sets the dynamics appears to be close to a critical state, which is key to reproduce the observed variety of time profiles. Conclusions. Our results propel the avalanche character in a critical regime as a key trait of the energy release in GRB engines, which underpins some kind of instability.</description>

      <title>Partial alignment between jets and megamasers: coherent or selective accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spins play a crucial role in the appearance, evolution and occupation fraction of massive black holes. To date observational estimates of massive black hole spins are scarce, and the assumptions commonly made in such estimates have been recently questioned. Similarly, theoretical models for massive black hole spin evolution, while reproducing the few observational constraints, are based on possibly oversimplified assumptions. New independent constraints on massive black hole spins are therefore of primary importance. We present a rigorous statistical analysis of the relative orientation of radio jets and mega-maser discs in ten low-redshift galaxies. We find a strong preference for (partial) alignment between jets and mega-masers, that can be attributed to two different causes: "coherent" and "selective" accretion. In the first case the partial alignment is due to an anisotropy in the gas reservoir fueling the growth of MBHs. In the second case the spin-dependent anisotropic feedback allows for long-lived accretion only if the orbits of the gas inflows are almost aligned to the MBH equatorial plane. A discussion of the implications of the two accretion scenarios on the evolution of MBHs is presented, together with an outlook on future observational tests aiming at discriminating between the two scenarios and at checking if any of the two apply to different redshifts and black hole mass regimes.</description>

      <title>A closer scrutiny of cosmic ray proton energy losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The percent-level precision attained by modern cosmic ray (CR) observations motivates reaching a comparable or better control of theoretical uncertainties. Here we focus on energy-loss processes affecting low-energy CR protons ($\sim 0.1-5$ GeV), where the experimental errors are small and collisional effects play a comparatively larger role with respect to collisionless transport ones. We study three aspects of the problem: i) We quantitatively assess the role of the nuclear elastic cross-section, for the first time, providing analytical formulae for the stopping power and inelasticity. ii) We discuss the error arising from treating both elastic and pion production inelastic interactions as continuous energy loss processes, as opposed to catastrophic ones. The former is the approximation used in virtually all modern numerical calculations. iii) We consider sub-leading effects such as relativistic corrections, radiative and medium processes in ionization energy-losses. Our analysis reveals that neglecting i) leads to errors close to 1%, notably around and below 1 GeV; neglecting ii) leads to errors reaching about 3% within the considered energy range; iii) contributes to a minor effect, gauged at the level of 0.1%. Consequently, while iii) can currently be neglected, ii) warrants consideration, and we also recommend incorporating i) into computations. We conclude with some perspectives on further steps to be taken towards a high-precision goal of theoretical CR predictions regarding the treatment of energy-losses.</description>

      <title>On the M87 jet structure near the central engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At present, there is no doubt that relativistic jets observed in active galactic nuclei pass from highly magnetized to weakly magnetized stage, which is observed as a break in the dependence on their width $d_{\rm jet}(z)$ on the distance $z$ to the central engine. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of observing another break, which should be located at shorter distances. The position of this break can be associated with the region of formation of the dense central core near the jet axis which was predicted both analytically and numerically more than a decade ago, but has not yet received sufficient attention. In this case, the observed width should be determined by the dense core, and not by the total transverse size of the jet. The calculations carried out in this paper, which took into account both the transverse electromagnetic structure of the jet and the change in the spectrum of emitting particles along its axis, indeed showed such behaviour. We also found the evidence of the predicted break in the jet expansion profile using stacked 15 GHz VLBA image of M87 radio jet and constrain the light cylinder radius.</description>

Abstract: This research note concerns the application of deep-learning-based multi-view-imaging techniques to data from the H.E.S.S. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope array. We find that the earlier the fusion of layer information from different views takes place in the neural network, the better our model performs with this data. Our analysis shows that the point in the network where the information from the different views is combined is far more important for the model performance than the method used to combine the information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new, simple analytical formulas to accurately describe light rays in spherically symmetric static spacetimes. These formulas extend those introduced by Beloborodov and refined by Poutanen for the Schwarzschild metric. Our enhanced formulas are designed to be applicable to a broader range of spacetimes, making them particularly valuable for describing phenomena around compact objects like neutron stars and black holes. As an illustration of their application, we present analytical studies of images of thin accretion disks surrounding black holes and explore their associated polarimetry.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection under the Presence of Shear Flow and Guide Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling of the relativistic reconnection outflow speed is studied in the presence of both shear flows parallel to the reconnecting magnetic fields and guide fields pointing out of the reconnection plane. In nonrelativistic reconnection, super-Alfv\'enic shear flows have been found to suppress reconnection. We extend the analytical model of this phenomenon to the relativistic regime and find similar behavior, which is confirmed by particle-in-cell simulations. Unlike the nonrelativistic limit, the addition of a guide field lowers the in-plane Alfv\'en velocity, contributing to slower outflow jets and the more efficient suppression of reconnection in strongly magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Cavity Detection of Gravitational Waves: Where Do We Stand?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) are predicted in various exotic scenarios involving both cosmological and astrophysical sources. These elusive signals have recently sparked the interest of a diverse community of researchers, due to the possibility of HFGW detection in the laboratory through graviton-photon conversion in strong magnetic fields. Notable examples include the redesign of the resonant cavities currently under development to detect the cosmic axion. In this work, we derive the sensitivities of some existing and planned resonant cavities to detect a HFGW background. As a concrete scenario, we consider the collective signals that originate from the merging of compact objects, such as two primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid mass window. Our findings improve over existing work by explicitly discussing and quantifying the loss in the experimental reach due to the actual coherence of the source. We elucidate on the approach we adopt in relation with recent literature on the topic. Most notably, we give a recipe for the estimate of the stochastic background that focuses on the presence of the signal in the cavity at all times and showing that, in the relevant PBH mass region, the signal is dominated by coherent binary mergers.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter on $f$-mode oscillations of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dark matter (DM) on $f$-mode oscillations in DM admixed neutron stars (NSs). We consider hadronic matter modeled by the relativistic mean field model and the DM model based on the neutron decay anomaly. We study the non-radial $f$-mode oscillations for such DM admixed NS in a full general relativistic framework. We investigate the impact of DM, DM self-interaction, and DM fraction on the $f$-mode characteristics. We derive relations encoding the effect of DM on $f$-mode parameters. We then perform a systematic study by varying all the model parameters within their known uncertainty range and obtain a universal relation for the DM fraction based on the total mass of the star and DM self-interaction strength. We also perform a correlation study among model parameters and NS observables, in particular, $f$-mode parameters. Finally, we check the $f$-mode universal relations (URs) for the case of DM admixed NSs and demonstrate the existence of a degeneracy between purely hadronic NSs and DM admixed NSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the effects of General Relativity modification on the Mass-Radius relations of Neutron Stars induced by the presence of the Quintessence field. We consider, in particular, the Kiselev model, according to which the Quintessence field, being present in the entire Universe, might also be present around massive objects. Considering the Equation of State (EoS) for Baryonic matter BSk22 derived by A. Y. Potekhin et al., we infer the upper limit for NS masses in the presence of Quintessence. The presence of Quintessence generates a peculiar effect for which the Mass-Radius relation is unvaried and therefore the presence of Quintessence is indistinguishable from ordinary matter, at least for the Kiselev model studied in this paper.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Lense-Thirring precession and the neutron star moment of inertia with pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are compact objects that host the densest forms of matter in the observable universe, providing unique opportunities to study the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. While precision measurements of NS masses through pulsar timing have imposed effective constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter, accurately determining the radius or moment of inertia (MoI) of a NS remains a major challenge. This article presents a detailed review on measuring the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession effect in the orbit of binary pulsars, which would give access to the MoI of NSs and offer further constraints on the EoS. We discuss the suitability of certain classes of binary pulsars for measuring the LT precession from the perspective of binary star evolution, and highlight five pulsars that exhibit properties promising to realise these goals in the near future. Finally, discoveries of compact binaries with shorter orbital periods hold the potential to greatly enhance measurements of the MoI of NSs. The MoI measurements of binary pulsars are pivotal to advancing our understanding of matter at supranuclear densities as well as improving the precision of gravity tests, such as the orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission and of tests of alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Constraining the onset density for the QCD phase transition with the neutrino signal from core-collapse supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The occurrence of a first-order hadron-quark matter phase transition at high baryon densities is investigated in astrophysical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, to decipher yet incompletely understood properties of the dense matter equation of state (EOS) using neutrinos from such cosmic events. It is found that the emission of a nonstandard second neutrino burst, dominated by electron antineutrinos, is not only a measurable signal for the appearance of deconfined quark matter but also reveals information about the state of matter at extreme conditions encountered at the supernova (SN) interior. To this end, a large set of spherically symmetric SN models is investigated, studying the dependence on the EOS and the stellar progenitor. General relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics is employed featuring three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic hadron-quark hybrid matter EOS class. Therefore, the DD2 relativistic mean-field hadronic model is employed, and several variations of it, and the string-flip model for the description of deconfined quark matter. The resulting hybrid model covers a representative range of onset densities for the phase transition and latent heats. This facilitates the direct connection between intrinsic signatures of the neutrino signal and properties of the EOS. In particular, a set of linear relations has been found empirically. These potentially provide a constraint for the onset density of a possible QCD phase transition from the future neutrino observation of the next galactic core-collapse SN, if a millisecond electron anti-neutrino burst is present around or less than 1s.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux plays an important role during a BHXRB outburst in radiative 2T GRMHD simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) X-ray binaries cycle through different spectral states of accretion over the course of months to years. Although fluctuations in the BH mass accretion rate are generally recognized as the most important component of state transitions, it is becoming increasingly evident that magnetic fields play a similarly important role. In this article, we present the first radiative two-temperature (2T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations in which an accretion disk transitions from a quiescent state at an accretion rate of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-10} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ to a hard-intermediate state at an accretion rate of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-2} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. This huge parameter space in mass accretion rate is bridged by artificially rescaling the gas density scale of the simulations. We present two jetted BH models with varying degrees of magnetic flux saturation. We demonstrate that in `Standard and Normal Evolution' models, which are unsaturated with magnetic flux, the hot torus collapses into a thin and cold accretion disk when $\dot{M} \gtrsim 5\times 10^{-3} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. On the other hand, in `Magnetically Arrested Disk' models, which are fully saturated with vertical magnetic flux, the plasma remains mostly hot with substructures that condense into cold clumps of gas when $\dot{M} \gtrsim 1 \times 10^{-2} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. This suggests that the spectral signatures observed during state transitions are closely tied to the level of magnetic flux saturation.</description>

      <title>Resolving the explosion of supernova 2023ixf in Messier 101 within its complex circumstellar environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing a supernova explosion shortly after it occurs can reveal important information about the physics of stellar explosions and the nature of the progenitor stars of supernovae (SNe). When a star with a well-defined edge explodes in vacuum, the first photons to escape from its surface appear as a brief shock-breakout flare. The duration of this flare can extend to at most a few hours even for nonspherical breakouts from supergiant stars, after which the explosion ejecta should expand and cool. Alternatively, for stars exploding within a distribution of sufficiently dense optically thick circumstellar material, the first photons escape from the material beyond the stellar edge, and the duration of the initial flare can extend to several days, during which the escaping emission indicates photospheric heating. The difficulty in detecting SN explosions promptly after the event has so far limited data regarding supergiant stellar explosions mostly to serendipitous observations that, owing to the lack of ultraviolet (UV) data, were unable to determine whether the early emission is heating or cooling, and hence the nature of the early explosion event. Here, we report observations of SN 2023ixf in the nearby galaxy M101, covering the early days of the event. Using UV spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as well as a comprehensive set of additional multiwavelength observations, we trace the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the event and are able to temporally resolve the emergence and evolution of the SN emission.</description>

Abstract: The full, radio to $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the Fermi bubbles is shown to be consistent with standard strong-shock electron acceleration at the bubble edge, without the unnatural energy cutoffs and unrealistic electron cooling of previous studies, if the ambient interstellar radiation is strong; the $\gamma$-ray cooling break should then have a microwave counterpart, undetected until now. Indeed, a broadband bubble-edge analysis uncovers a pronounced downstream dust component, which masked the anticipated $\sim35$ GHz spectral break, and the same overall radio softening consistent with Kraichnan diffusion previously reported in $\gamma$-rays.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for compact stars with exotic degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the highly dense matter inside the supernova remnant compact star is not constrained by terrestrial experiments and hence modeled phenomenologically to accommodate the astrophysical observations from compact stars. The observable properties of the compact stars are highly sensitive to the microscopic model of highly dense matter. However, some universal relations exist between some macroscopic properties of compact stars independent of the matter model. We study the universal relation including the stars containing exotic degrees of freedom such as heavier strange and non-strange baryons, strange quark matter in normal and superconducting phases, etc. We examine the universal relations for quantities moment of inertia - tidal love number - quadrupole moment. We also study the correlation of non-radial f-mode and p-mode frequencies with stellar properties. We find the f-mode frequency observes the universal relation with dimensionless tidal deformability but the p-mode frequency does not show a good correlation with stellar properties. The p-mode frequency is sensitive to the composition of the matter. We find that universal relation is also applicable for stars with exotic matter in the core of the star with several models of exotic matter.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of a joint {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} campaign on the active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 4329A, consisting of 9 $\times$ 20 ks {\it XMM-Newton} observations, and 5 $\times$ 20 ks {\it NuSTAR} observations within nine days, performed in August 2021. Within each observation, the AGN is not very variable, with the fractional variability never exceeding 5%. Flux variations are observed between the different observations, on timescales of days, with a 30% ratio between the minimum and the maximum 2-10 keV flux. These variations follow the softer-when-brighter behavior typically observed in AGN. In all observations, a soft excess is clearly present. Consistently with previous observations, the X-ray spectra of the source exhibit a cut-off energy between 140 and 250 keV, constant within the error in the different observations. We detected a prominent component of the $6.4$\,keV Fe~K$\alpha$ line consistent with being constant during the monitoring, consisting of an unresolved narrow core and a broader component likely originating in the inner accredion disc. We find that the reflection component is weak ($R_{\rm max}=0.009\pm0.002$) and most likely originating in distant neutral medium. We also found the presence of a warm absorber component together with an ultra-fast outflow. Looking at their energetic, these outflows have enough mechanical power to exercise a significant feedback impact on the AGN surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>On a spectral method for $\beta$-particle bound excitation collisions in kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of $\beta$-particles with the weakly ionized plasma background is an important mechanism for powering the kilonova transient signal from neutron star mergers. For this purpose, we present an implementation of the approximate fast-particle collision kernel, described by Inokuti (1971) following the seminal formulation of Bethe (1930), in a spectral solver of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann equations. In particular, we expand the fast-particle plane-wave atomic excitation kernel into coefficients of the Hermite basis, and derive the relevant discrete spectral system. In this fast-particle limit, the approach permits the direct use of atomic data, including optical oscillator strengths, normally applied to photon-matter interaction. The resulting spectral matrix is implemented in the MASS-APP spectral solver framework, in a way that avoids full matrix storage per spatial zone. We numerically verify aspects of the matrix construction, and present a proof-of-principle 3D simulation of a 2D axisymmetric kilonova ejecta snapshot. Our preliminary numerical results indicate that a reasonable choice of Hermite basis parameters for $\beta$-particles in the kilonova are a bulk velocity parameter $\vec{u}=0$, a thermal velocity parameter $\vec{\alpha}=0.5c$, and a 9x9x9 mode velocity basis set (Hermite orders 0 to 8 in each dimension). For ejecta-interior sample zones, we estimate the ratio of thermalization from large-angle ($\gtrsim2.5^{\circ}$) bound excitation scattering to total thermalization is $\sim$0.002-0.003.</description>

      <title>Strong Bow Shocks: Turbulence and An Exact Self-Similar Asymptotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that strong bow shocks are turbulent and non-universal near the head, but asymptote to a universal steady, self-similar, and analytically solvable flow in the downstream. The turbulence is essentially 3D, and has been confirmed by a 3D simulation. The asymptotic behavior is confirmed with high resolution 2D and 3D simulations of a cold uniform wind encountering both a solid spherical obstacle and stellar wind. This solution is relevant in the context of: (i) probing the kinematic properties of observed high-velocity compact bodies -- e.g., runaway stars and/or supernova ejecta blobs -- flying through the interstellar medium; and (ii) constraining stellar bow shock luminosities invoked by some quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) models.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption Encores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs), made up of a dense concentrations of stars and the compact objects they leave behind, are ubiquitous in the central regions of galaxies, surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Close interactions between stars and stellar-mass black holes (sBH) lead to tidal disruption events (TDEs). We uncover an interesting new phenomenon: For a subset of these, the unbound debris (to the sBH) remain bound to the SMBH, accreting at a later time, and thus giving rise to a second flare. We compute the rate of such events, and find them ranging within $10^{-6}$ -$10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$gal$^{-1}$ for SMBH mass $\simeq 10^{6}-10^{9}M_\odot$. Time delays between the two flares spread over a wide range, from less than a year to hundreds of years. The temporal evolution of the light curves of the second flare can vary between the standard $t^{-5/3}$ power-law to much steeper decays, providing a natural explanation for observed light curves in tension with the classical TDE model. Our predictions have implications for learning about NSC properties and calibrating its sBH population. Some double flares may be electromagnetic counterparts to LISA Extreme-Mass-Ratio-Inspiral (EMRI) sources. Another important implication is the possible existence of TDE-like events in very massive SMBHs, where TDEs are not expected. Such flares can affect spin measurements relying on TDEs in the upper SMBH range.</description>

      <title>AT2023lli: A Tidal Disruption Event with Prominent Optical Early Bump and Delayed Episodic X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-cadence, multiwavelength observations have continuously revealed the diversity of tidal disruption events (TDEs), thus greatly advancing our knowledge and understanding of TDEs. In this work, we conducted an intensive optical-UV and X-ray follow-up campaign of TDE AT2023lli, and found a remarkable month-long bump in its UV/optical light curve nearly two months prior to maximum brightness. The bump represents the longest separation time from the main peak among known TDEs to date. The main UV/optical outburst declines as $t^{-4.10}$, making it one of the fastest decaying optically selected TDEs. Furthermore, we detected sporadic X-ray emission 30 days after the UV/optical peak, accompanied by a reduction in the period of inactivity. It is proposed that the UV/optical bump could be caused by the self-intersection of the stream debris, whereas the primary peak is generated by the reprocessed emission of the accretion process. In addition, our results suggest that episodic X-ray radiation during the initial phase of decline may be due to the patched obscurer surrounding the accretion disk, a phenomenon associated with the inhomogeneous reprocessing process. The double TDE scenario, in which two stars are disrupted in sequence, is also a possible explanation for producing the observed early bump and main peak. We anticipate that the multicolor light curves of TDEs, especially in the very early stages, and the underlying physics can be better understood in the near future with the assistance of dedicated surveys such as the deep high-cadence survey of the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST).</description>

      <title>Parametric resonance in abelian and non-abelian gauge fields via space-time oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of abelian $U(1)$ electromagnetic as well as non-abelian $SU(2)$ gauge fields, in the presence of space-time oscillations. Analysis of the time evolution of abelian gauge fields shows the presence of parametric resonance in spatial modes. A similar analysis in the case of non-abelian gauge fields, in the linear approximation, shows the presence of the same resonant spatial modes. The resonant modes induce large fluctuations in physical observables including those that break the $CP-$symmetry. We also carry out time evolution of small random fluctuations of the gauge fields, using numerical simulations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. These simulations help to study non-linear effects in the case of non-abelian gauge theories. Our results show that there is an increase in energy density with the coupling, at late times. These results suggest that gravitational waves may excite non-abelian gauge fields more efficiently than electromagnetic fields. Also, gravitational waves in the early Universe and from the merger of neutron stars, black holes etc. may enhance $CP-$violation and generate an imbalance in chiral charge distributions, magnetic fields etc.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Interpreting the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set as Early Universe Gravitational Waves Produced by ALP Induced Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a possible early universe source for the recent observation of a stochastic gravitational wave background at the NANOGrav pulsar timing array. The source is a tachyonic instability in a dark gauge field induced by an axion-like particle (ALP), a known source for gravitational waves. We find that relative to the previous analysis with the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, the current 15-year data set favors parameter space with a relatively larger axion mass and decay constant. This favored parameter space is heavily constrained by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ and overproduction of ALP dark matter. While there are potential mechanisms for avoiding the second problem, evading the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint remains highly challenging. In particular, we find that the gravitational wave magnitude is significantly suppressed with respect to the gauge boson dark radiation, which implies that successfully explaining the NANOGrav observation requires a large additional dark radiation, violating the cosmological constraints. Satisfying the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint will limit the potential contribution from this mechanism to the observed signal to at most a percent level.</description>

      <title>Electron Heating in 2D Particle-in-Cell Simulations of Quasi-Perpendicular Low-Beta Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the thermal electron energization in 1D and 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of quasi-perpendicular, low-beta ($\beta_p=0.25$) collisionless ion-electron shocks with mass ratio $m_i/m_e=200$, fast Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{ms}=1$-$4$, and upstream magnetic field angle $\theta_{Bn} = 55$-$85^\circ$ from shock normal $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$. It is known that shock electron heating is described by an ambipolar, $\boldsymbol{B}$-parallel electric potential jump, $\Delta\phi_\parallel$, that scales roughly linearly with the electron temperature jump. Our simulations have $\Delta\phi_\parallel/(0.5 m_i {u_\mathrm{sh}}^2) \sim 0.1$-$0.2$ in units of the pre-shock ions' bulk kinetic energy, in agreement with prior measurements and simulations. Different ways to measure $\phi_\parallel$, including the use of de Hoffmann-Teller frame fields, agree to tens-of-percent accuracy. Neglecting off-diagonal electron pressure tensor terms can lead to a systematic underestimate of $\phi_\parallel$ in our low-$\beta_p$ shocks. We further focus on two $\theta_{Bn}=65^\circ$ shocks: a $\mathcal{M}_s=4$ ($\mathcal{M}_A=1.8$) case with a long, $30 d_i$ precursor of whistler waves along $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$, and a $\mathcal{M}_s=7$ ($\mathcal{M}_A=3.2$) case with a shorter, $5d_i$ precursor of whistlers oblique to both $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$; $d_i$ is the ion skin depth. Within the precursors, $\phi_\parallel$ has a secular rise towards the shock along multiple whistler wavelengths and also has localized spikes within magnetic troughs. In a 1D simulation of the $\mathcal{M}_s=4$, $\theta_{Bn}=65^\circ$ case, $\phi_\parallel$ shows a weak dependence on the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, and $\phi_\parallel$ decreases by a factor of 2 as $m_i/m_e$ is raised to the true proton-electron value of 1836.</description>

      <title>The origin of supermassive black holes at cosmic dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady spherically symmetric accretion in the combined potential of a central black hole and a dark matter halo. For the halo, we consider a Hernquist and an NFW potential and calculate the critical points of the flow. We find that the trans-sonic solution to the centre is not possible without a black hole, whereas two types of trans-sonic solutions are possible in its presence. We also derive the mass accretion rate for a black hole at the centre of a dark matter halo. Our results indicate two phases of accretion. The first is an initial phase with a low accretion rate that depends on the black hole mass, followed by a second phase with a high accretion rate that depends on the halo mass. In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback.</description>

      <title>A Gravitational Waveform Model for Detecting Accelerating Inspiraling Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytic frequency-domain gravitational waveform model for an inspiraling binary whose center-of-mass undergoes a small acceleration, assumed to be constant during the detection, such as when it orbits a distant tertiary mass. The center-of-mass acceleration along the line of sight is incorporated as a new parameter that perturbs the standard TaylorF2 model. We calculate the wave phase to 3rd post-Newtonian order and first order in the acceleration. It is shown that acceleration most significantly modifies the wave phase in the low frequency portion of the signal, so ground-based detectors with a good sensitivity at low frequencies are the most effective at detecting this effect. We present a Fisher information calculation to quantify the detectability of this effect at advanced LIGO A Plus, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope over the mass range of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, and discuss degeneracy between acceleration and other parameters. We also determine the parameter space where the acceleration is large enough that the wave phase model would have to be extended to nonlinear orders in the acceleration.</description>

      <title>Parameterizing black hole orbits for adiabatic inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic binary inspiral in the small mass ratio limit treats the small body as moving along a geodesic of a large Kerr black hole, with the geodesic slowly evolving due to radiative backreaction. Up to initial conditions, geodesics are typically parameterized in two ways: using the integrals of motion energy $E$, axial angular momentum $L_z$, and Carter constant $Q$; or, using orbit geometry parameters semi-latus rectum $p$, eccentricity $e$, and (cosine of ) inclination $x_I \equiv \cos I$. The community has long known how to compute orbit integrals as functions of the orbit geometry parameters, i.e., as functions expressing $E(p, e, x_I)$, and likewise for $L_z$ and $Q$. Mappings in the other direction -- functions $p(E, L_z, Q)$, and likewise for $e$ and $x_I$ -- have not yet been developed in general. In this note, we develop generic mappings from ($E$, $L_z$, $Q$) to ($p$, $e$, $x_I$). The mappings are particularly simple for equatorial orbits ($Q = 0$, $x_I = \pm1$), and can be evaluated efficiently for generic cases. These results make it possible to more accurately compute adiabatic inspirals by eliminating the need to use a Jacobian which becomes singular as inspiral approaches the last stable orbit.</description>

      <title>A VLBI Software Correlator for Fast Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One major goal in fast radio burst science is to detect fast radio bursts (FRBs) over a wide field of view without sacrificing the angular resolution required to pinpoint them to their host galaxies. Wide-field detection and localization capabilities have already been demonstrated using connected-element interferometry; the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project will push this further using widefield cylindrical telescopes as widefield outriggers for very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). This paper describes an offline VLBI software correlator written in Python for the CHIME/FRB Outriggers project. It includes features well-suited to modern widefield instruments like multibeaming/multiple phase center correlation, pulse gating including coherent dedispersion, and a novel correlation algorithm based on the quadratic estimator formalism. This algorithm mitigates sensitivity loss which arises in instruments where the windowing and channelization is done outside the VLBI correlator at each station, which accounts for a 30 percent sensitivity drop away from the phase center. Our correlation algorithm recovers this sensitivity on both simulated and real data. As an end to end check of our software, we have written a preliminary pipeline for VLBI calibration and single-pulse localization, which we use in Lanman et al. (2024) to verify the astrometric accuracy of the CHIME/FRB Outriggers array.</description>
