      <title>Minimal grid diagrams of the prime knots with crossing number 14 and arc index 13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are 46,972 prime knots with crossing number 14. Among them 19,536 are alternating and have arc index 16. Among the non-alternating knots, 17, 477, and 3,180 have arc index 10, 11, and 12, respectively. The remaining 23,762 have arc index 13 or 14. There are none with arc index smaller than 10 or larger than 14. We used the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code of the 23,762 knots provided by the program Knotscape to locate non-alternating edges in their diagrams. Our method requires at least six non-alternating edges to find arc presentations with 13 arcs. We obtained 8,027 knots having arc index 13. We show them by their minimal grid diagrams. The remaining 15,735 prime non-alternating 14 crossing knots have arc index 14 as determined by the lower bound obtained from the Kauffman polynomial.</description>

      <title>Connecting essential triangulations II: via 2-3 moves only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work we showed that for a manifold $M$, whose universal cover has infinitely many boundary components, the set of essential ideal triangulations of $M$ is connected via 2-3, 3-2, 0-2, and 2-0 moves. Here we show that this set is also connected via 2-3 and 3-2 moves alone, if we ignore those triangulations for which no 2-3 move results in an essential triangulation. If we also allow V-moves and their inverses then the full set of essential ideal triangulations of $M$ is once again connected. These results also hold if we replace essential triangulations with $L$-essential triangulations.</description>

      <title>Quadratic differentials and function theory on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite-area holomorphic quadratic differentials on an arbitrary Riemann surface $X=\mathbb{H}/\Gamma$ is uniquely determined by its horizontal measured foliation. By extending our prior result for $\Gamma$ of the first kind to arbitrary Fuchsian group $\Gamma$, we obtain that a measured foliation $\mathcal{F}$ is realized by the horizontal foliation of a finite-area holomorphic quadratic differential on $X$ if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ has finite Dirichlet integral. We determine the image of this correspondence when the infinite Riemann surface has bounded geometry -- an extension of the realization result of Hubbard and Masur for compact surfaces. A corollary is that a planar surface $X$ with bounded pants decomposition and with (at most) countably many ends is parabolic, i.e., does not support Green's function, in notation $X\in O_G$ where $G$ is Green's function. The class of harmonic functions with finite Dirichlet integral is denoted by $HD$. We give a geometric proof that the class $O_{HD}$ of the Riemann surfaces (that do not support non-constant $HD$-functions) is invariant under quasiconformal maps. Lyons proved that the $O_{HB}$ class (surfaces that do not support non-constant bounded harmonic functions) is not invariant under quasiconformal maps, and it is well-known that the $O_G$ class is invariant. Therefore, the noninvariant class $O_{HB}$ is between two invariant classes: $O_G\subset O_{HB}\subset O_{HD}$.</description>

      <title>Stably diffeomorphic manifolds and the realisation of modified surgery obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.05632v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every $k \geq 2$ we construct infinitely many $4k$-dimensional manifolds that are all stably diffeomorphic but pairwise not homotopy equivalent. Each of these manifolds has hyperbolic intersection form and is stably parallelisable. In fact we construct infinitely many such infinite sets. To achieve this we prove a realisation result for appropriate subsets of Kreck's modified surgery monoid $\ell_{2q+1}(\mathbb{Z}[\pi])$, analogous to Wall's realisation of the odd-dimensional surgery obstruction $L$-group $L_{2q+1}^s(\mathbb{Z}[\pi])$.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphism groups of telescoping 2-manifolds are strongly distorted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the work of Mann and Rafi, we introduce an expanded definition of a telescoping 2-manifold and proceed to study the homeomorphism group of a telescoping 2-manifold. Our main result shows that it is strongly distorted. We then give a simple description of its commutator subgroup, which is index one, two, or four depending on the topology of the manifold. Moreover, we show its commutator subgroup is uniformly perfect with commutator width at most two, and we give a family of uniform normal generators for its commutator subgroup. As a consequence of the latter result, we show that for an (orientable) telescoping 2-manifold, every (orientation-preserving) homeomorphism can be expressed as a product of at most 17 conjugate involutions. Finally, we provide analogous statements for mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of quadratic differentials: Abel-Jacobi map and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of framed quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities parameterized by a decorated marked surface with punctures (DMSp), where simple zeros, double poles and higher order poles respectively correspond to decorations, punctures and boundary components. We show that the fundamental group of this space equals the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi (AJ) map from the surface mapping class group of DMSp to the first homology group of the marked surface (without decorations/punctures). Moreover, a universal cover of this space is given by the space of stability conditions on the associated 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Furthermore, when we partially compactify and orbifold this moduli space by allowing the collision of simple zeros and some of the double poles, the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the deformed (with respect to those collidable double poles) 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Finally, we show that the fundamental group of this partially compactified orbifold equals the quotient group of the kernel of the AJ map by the square of any point-pushing diffeomorphism around any collidable double pole. This construction can produces any non-exceptional spherical/Euclidean Artin braid groups.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Measurable Pseudo-Anosov Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of measurable pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms of surfaces, a generalization of Thurston's pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. A measurable pseudo-Anosov map has a transverse pair of full measure turbulations consisting of streamlines which are dense immersed lines: these turbulations are equipped with measures which are expanded and contracted uniformly by the homeomorphism. The turbulations need not have a good product structure anywhere, but have some local structure imposed by the existence of tartans: bundles of unstable and stable streamline segments which intersect regularly, and on whose intersections the product of the measures on the turbulations agrees with the ambient measure. We prove that measurable pseudo-Anosov maps are transitive, have dense periodic points, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and are ergodic with respect to the ambient measure. Measurable pseudo-Anosovs maps were introduced in [11], where we constructed a parameterized family of non-conjugate examples on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Acylindrical hyperbolicity and the centers of Artin groups that are not free of infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charney and Morris-Wright showed acylindrical hyperbolicity of Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not joins, by studying clique-cube complexes and the actions on them. The authors developed their study and clarified when acylindrical hyperbolicity holds for Artin groups of infinite type associated with graphs that are not cones. In this paper, we introduce reduced clique-cube complexes. By using them, we show acylindrical hyperbolicity of irreducible Artin groups associated with graphs that are not cliques, that is, irreducible Artin groups that are not free of infinity. Such Artin groups contain infinite type Artin groups of type FC. As an application, we see that the centers of such Artin groups are finite, and that actually they are trivial in many cases.</description>

      <title>Section conjectures over $\mathbb{C}$ and Kodaira fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and study topological and Hodge theoretic analogues of Grothendieck's section conjecture over the complex numbers. We study these questions in the context of family of curves, in particular Kodaira fibrations, and in the context of the family of Jacobians associated to a Kodaira fibration. We showed that in the case of family of curves, both the topological and Hodge-theoretic analogues of the injectivity part of the section conjecture holds, and that in the case of family of Jacobians, the topological analogue of the surjectivity part of the section conjecture does not hold in general. For family of curves, we also reduce the topological analogue of the surjectivity part of the section conjecture to the case where the families have no algebraic sections.</description>
