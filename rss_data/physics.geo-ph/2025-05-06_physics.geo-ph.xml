      <title>DiffusionInv: Prior-enhanced Bayesian Full Waveform Inversion using Diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is an advanced seismic inversion technique for quantitatively estimating subsurface properties. However, with FWI, it is hard to converge to a geologically-realistic subsurface model. Thus, we propose a DiffusionInv approach by integrating a pretrained diffusion model representation of the velocity into FWI within a Bayesian framework. We first train the diffusion model on realistic and expected velocity model samples, preferably prepared based on our geological knowledge of the subsurface, to learn their prior distribution. Once this pretraining is complete, we fine-tune the neural network parameters of the diffusion model by using an L2 norm of data misfit between simulated and observed seismic data as a loss function. This process enables the model to elegantly learn the posterior distribution of velocity models given seismic observations starting from the previously learned prior distribution. The approximate representation of the posterior probability distribution provides valuable insights into the inversion uncertainty for physics-constrained FWI given the seismic data and prior model information. Compared to regularized FWI methods, the diffusion model under a probabilistic framework allows for a more adaptable integration of prior information into FWI, thus mitigating the multi-solution issue and enhancing the reliability of the inversion result. Compared to data-driven FWI methods, the integration of physical constraints in DiffusionInv enhances its ability to generalize across diverse seismic scenarios. The test results in the Hess and Otway examples demonstrate that the DiffusionInv method is capable of recovering the velocity model with high resolution by incorporating the prior model information. The estimated posterior probability distribution helps us understand the inversion uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Bayesian full waveform inversion with sequential surrogate model refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian formulations of inverse problems are attractive for their ability to incorporate prior knowledge and update probabilistic models as new data become available. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods sample posterior probability density functions (pdfs) but require accurate prior models and many likelihood evaluations. Dimensionality-reduction methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), can help define the prior and train surrogate models that efficiently approximate costly forward solvers. However, for problems like full waveform inversion, the complex input/output relations often cannot be captured well by surrogate models trained only on prior samples, leading to biased results. Including samples from high-posterior-probability regions can improve accuracy, but these regions are hard to identify in advance. We propose an iterative method that progressively refines the surrogate model. Starting with low-frequency data, we train an initial surrogate and perform an MCMC inversion. The resulting posterior samples are then used to retrain the surrogate, allowing us to expand the frequency bandwidth in the next inversion step. Repeating this process reduces model errors and improves the surrogate's accuracy over the relevant input domain. Ultimately, we obtain a highly accurate surrogate across the full bandwidth, enabling a final MCMC inversion. Numerical results from 2D synthetic crosshole Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) examples show that our method outperforms ray-based approaches and those relying solely on prior sampling. The overall computational cost is reduced by about two orders of magnitude compared to full finite-difference time-domain modeling.</description>

      <title>Detecting Urban Earthquakes with the San Fernando Valley Nodal Array and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The San Fernando Valley, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, is a seismically active urban environment. Large-magnitude earthquakes, such as the 1994 Mw 6.7 Northridge event that occurred on a blind fault beneath the valley, caused significant infrastructure damage in the region, underscoring the need for enhanced seismic monitoring to improve the identification of buried faults and hazard evaluation. Currently, the Southern California Earthquake Data Center operates four broadband instruments within the valley; however, the networks ability to capture small earthquakes beneath the region may be limited. To demonstrate how this data gap can be filled, we use recordings from the San Fernando Valley array comprised of 140 nodal instruments with interstation distances ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 km that recorded for one month. High anthropogenic noise levels in urbanized areas tend to conceal earthquake signals, therefore we applied a previously developed machine learning model finetuned on similar waveforms to detect events and pick seismic phases. In a two-step event association workflow, isolated phase picks were first culled, which eliminated false positive detections and reduced computational runtime. We located 62 events within a 209 km radius of our array, including 36 new events that were undetected by the regional network, with magnitudes ranging from ML 0.13 to 4. One event cluster reveals a previously unidentified (5.3 km by 4 km) blind fault zone located ~5 km beneath the southern part of the valley. Seismicity from this zone is rare in the regional catalog (&lt;3 events per year), despite producing a Mb 4.4 event in 2014. Our results highlight the benefits of detecting small-magnitude seismicity for hazard estimation. Temporary nodal arrays can identify critical gaps in regional monitoring and guide site selection for permanent stations.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter constraints on empirical infrasound period-yield relations for bolides and implications for planetary defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How effective are methods for estimating bolide energies from infrasound signal period-yield relationships? A single global period-energy relation can obscure significant variability introduced by parameters such as the atmospheric Doppler wind profile and the bolide's energy deposition profile as a function of altitude. Bolide speed, entry angle, burst altitude, and multi-episode fragmentation all may play a role in defining the detected period of the shockwave. By leveraging bolide light curve data from the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), we re-examined the period-energy relation as a function of these parameters. Through a bootstrap approach, we show that various event subsets can deviate from widely cited period-energy models and we identify which specific conditions most strongly reshape the period-energy scaling. The results define both the fidelity and reliability of period-energy relations when no additional data beyond the infrasound record is available and improve the outcome when supporting data from bolide trajectories and light curves are included. Ultimately, these findings expand the scope of earlier models, providing a nuanced and robust framework for infrasound-only yield estimation under a range of bolide scenarios.</description>

      <title>Statistical geochemical constraints on present-day water outgassing as a source of secondary atmospheres on the TRAPPIST-1 exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TRAPPIST-1 planetary system is observationally favorable for studying if planets orbiting M stars can retain atmospheres and host habitable conditions. Recent JWST secondary eclipse observations of TRAPPIST-1 c rule out a thick \ch{CO2} atmosphere but do not rule out atmospheric water vapor or its photochemical product, oxygen. Given the high expected escape rate, maintenance of atmospheric water vapor would require a present-day water source, such as volcanic outgassing. Here, we simulate water outgassing on the TRAPPIST-1 planets over a broad phase space based on solar system terrestrial bodies. We then apply two filters based on observation and geochemistry that narrow this phase space and constrain the plausible outgassing scenarios. For all seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that the water outgassing rate is most likely $\sim$0.03x Earth's but has upper limits of $\sim$8x Earth's. The allowed range also implies low, Mars-like magma emplacement rates and relatively dry, Earth-like mantles, although mantle water mass fractions up to 1 wt\% are possible. We also present scenarios with magma emplacement rates similar to Mars, Earth, and Io, resulting in different preferred mantle water content and outgassing rates. We find that water outgassing rates are potentially high enough to balance water escape rates, providing a theoretical pathway for the TRAPPIST-1 planets to maintain surface water or water-vapor-containing atmospheres over long timescales. The bounds on outgassing rates and interior properties can be used in atmospheric chemistry and escape models to contextualize future observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and may be applicable to other terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Lakeplace: Sensing interactions between lakes and human activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban freshwater ecosystems, composed of rivers, ponds, lakes, and other water bodies, have essential socioeconomic and ecological values for urban residents. However, research investigating how individuals interact with lakes remains limited, especially within cities and at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. To fill this gap, we propose a data-driven analytical framework that comprehensively senses human-lake interactions and profiles the social-demographic characteristics of intra-city lakes. The term "lakeplace" is proposed to depict a place containing lakes and human activities within it. For each lake, the geographic boundary of its lakeplace refers to the first-order administrative units, reflecting the neighboring scale of lake socioeconomics. Utilizing large-scale individual mobile positioning data, we performed lakeplace sensing on the 2,036 major lakes in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA), Minnesota, and the people interacting with them. The popularity of each lakeplace was measured by its temporal visitations and further categorized as on-lake and around-lake human activities. Popular lakeplaces were investigated to depict whether the attractiveness of a lake is mostly brought by the lake itself, or the social-demographic environment around it. The lakeplace sensing framework offers a practical approach to the spatiotemporal characteristics of human activities and understanding the social-demographic knowledge related to human-lake systems. Our work exemplifies the social sensing of human-environment interactions via geospatial big data, shedding light on human-oriented sustainable urban planning and urban water resource management.</description>

      <title>Earths composition: origin, evolution and energy budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One in every two atoms in the Earth, Mars, and the Moon is oxygen; it is the third most abundant element in the solar system. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the terrestrial planets are different from those of the Sun and demonstrate that these planets are not direct compositional analogs of the solar photosphere. Likewise, the Suns O/Fe, Fe/Mg and Mg/Si values are distinct from those of inner solar system chondrites and terrestrial planets. These four elements (O, Fe, Mg, Si) make up about 94% by mass of the rocky planets and their abundances are determined uniquely using geophysical, geochemical and cosmochemical constraints. The rocky planets grew rapidly from planetesimals, most of which were differentiated, having a core and a mantle, before being accreted. Planetary growth in the early stages of protoplanetary disk evolution was rapid and was only partially recorded by the meteoritic record. The noncarbonaceous meteorites (NC) provide insights into the early history of the inner solar system and are used to construct a framework for how the rocky planets were assembled. NC chondrites have chondrule ages that are two to three million years younger than t_zero (the age of calcium-aluminum inclusions, CAI), documenting that chondrites are middle- to late-stage products of solar system evolution. The composition of the Earth, its current form of mantle convection, and the amount of radiogenic power that drives its engine remain controversial topics. Earths dynamics are driven by primordial and radiogenic heat sources. Measurement of the Earths geoneutrino flux defines its radiogenic power and restricts its bulk composition. Using the latest data from the KamLAND and Borexino geoneutrino experiments affirms that the Earth has 20 TW of radiogenic power and sets the proportions of refractory lithophile elements in the bulk silicate Earth at 2.5 to 2.7 times that in CI chondrites.</description>
