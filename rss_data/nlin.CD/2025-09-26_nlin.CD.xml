      <title>Nonreciprocity induced spatiotemporal chaos: Reactive vs dissipative routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions fundamentally alter the collective dynamics of nonlinear oscillator networks. Here we investigate Stuart-Landau oscillators on a ring with nonreciprocal reactive or dissipative couplings combined with Kerr-type or dissipative nonlinearities. Through numerical simulations and linear analysis, we uncover two distinct and universal pathways by which enhanced nonreciprocity drives spatiotemporal chaos. Nonreciprocal reactive coupling with Kerr-type nonlinearity amplifies instabilities through growth-rate variations, while nonreciprocal dissipative coupling with Kerr-type nonlinearity broadens eigenfrequency distributions and destroys coherence, which, upon nonlinear saturation, evolve into fully developed chaos. In contrast, dissipative nonlinearities universally suppress chaos, enforcing bounded periodic states. Our findings establish a minimal yet general framework that goes beyond case-specific models and demonstrate that nonreciprocity provides a universal organizing principle for the onset and control of spatiotemporal chaos in oscillator networks and related complex systems.</description>

      <title>Mind the crosscap: $\tau$-scaling in non-orientable gravity and time-reversal-invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral statistics of quantum chaotic systems are governed by random matrix universality. In many cases of interest, time-reversal symmetry selects the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) as the relevant universality class. In holographic CFTs, this is mirrored by the presence of non-orientable geometries in the dual gravitational path integral. In this work, we analyze general properties of these matrix models and their gravitational counterparts. First, we develop a formalism to express the universal level statistics in the canonical ensemble for arbitrary spectral curves, leading to a topological expansion with finite radius of convergence in the late-time $\tau$-scaling limit. Then, we focus on topological gravity and study topological recursion on the moduli space of non-orientable surfaces. We find that the Weil-Petersson volumes display non-analytic behaviour multiplying polynomials in the boundary lengths. The volumes give rise to wormholes with late-time divergences, in contrast with the orientable case, which is finite. We identify systematic cancellations among WP volumes implied by the consistency and finiteness of the $\tau$-scaling limit. In particular, the cancellation of late-time divergences requires a nontrivial genus resummation. Working in the gravitational microcanonical ensemble, we derive and resum all orders of the topological expansion matching the GOE matrix model in the high-energy regime.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Discrete Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics, which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaotic synchronization in coupled dissipative time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The locations of the classical and quantum crossover differ, reflecting the noncommutativity of the infinite-spin and infinite-time limits and the impact of entanglement, quantified via the entanglement entropy between subsystems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on the system of globally coupled logistic maps (GCM), a well-known model exhibiting chaotic itinerancy. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as coherent and intermittent phases.</description>
