      <title>Stochastic Kinetics of Protein Molecules in a Gene Expression Model under Burst Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burst approximation is a widely-used technique to simplify stochastic gene expression models. However, both analytical results and efficient algorithms are currently unavailable for general models under the burst approximation. In this article, we systematically analyze surrogate models with multiple gene states. Analytical solution to the chemical master equation is provided, which is further exploited from two perspectives. Theoretically, several inequalities are established using functional analysis. We conclude that the steady-state distribution of protein copy number is bounded from above by a constant multiple of some negative binomial distribution if the burst size is geometrically distributed. Computationally, efficient algorithms are developed under three circumstances based on the standard binomial moment method.</description>

      <title>Wind as Driver of Bird and Bat Abundance, Flight Direction, Altitude, and Speed on the North Atlantic Shelf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the collision risk of birds and bats with offshore wind turbines requires an understanding of the drivers of flying animal behavior at offshore wind sites. An omnidirectional S-band radar system was deployed on a research barge on the Northeastern Shelf of the United States (40.9 deg N, 70.79 deg W) and collected data for a 5-week window during the 2024 autumn bird and bat migration. The barge also sup- ported two profiling lidar systems that measured the wind speed and direction. This study presents a first methodological approach for analyzing radar and lidar data together, providing a framework for future analyses of offshore bird and bat movements that can be used to improve collision risk models. Coupling the radar animal tracks with measured wind speed profiles revealed that wind is a driver of animal pres- ence, flight direction, flight height, and flight speed. Further, a hierarchical clustering methodology was developed to investigate behavior by approximate animal size. For example, smaller animals had con- centrated flight direction distributions aligned with the wind and flew at a variety of altitudes, whereas bigger animals flew in a wide variety of directions but were concentrated at low altitudes. Our results provide the first insights into animal behavior at offshore wind sites with paired radar and lidar data.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of three-dimensional shapes of normal and disease-related erythrocytes from partial observations using multi-fidelity neural networks</title>

Abstract: Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.</description>

      <title>3D printed waveguides for optogenetics applications: design optimization and optical characterization</title>

Abstract: Optogenetics has emerged as a powerful tool for disease modeling, enabling precise control of cellular activities through light stimulation and providing a valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Innovative materials and technologies such as micro-LEDs, optical fibers and micro/nano probes have been developed to allow precise spatial and temporal control of light delivery to target cells. Recent advances in 3D printing have further enhanced optogenetic applications by enabling the fabrication of implantable, customizable, and miniaturized light stimulation systems with high spatial resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of a 3D printed light delivery system for brain organoid stimulation exploring the capabilities of projection microstereolithography (P$\mu$SL). We characterized the optical properties of the high-resolution acrylate-based 3D print resin, i.e., refractive index and extinction coefficient, to evaluate if the light transmission efficiency might limit the performance of the optogenetic stimulation systems. Finite element method simulations were employed to optimize the 3D printed design. An optogenetic setup was developed for optimal light delivery, and initial tests with optogenetically modified cells showed light-induced dopamine release with a stimulation efficiency of 2.8\%, confirming the 3D printed waveguide functionality and guiding future optimization. Our results demonstrate that this light stimulation tool offers strong potential for advancing customizable optogenetic applications.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>

      <title>Anti-aligning Self-propelled Model of Two Species: Emergence of Self-organized Heterogeneous Aligned and Clustered Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions generally do not form a polar order. However, in this Letter, we show that when multiple types of such particles coexist and interact through aligning interactions between different species, a global polar order can emerge through the formation of elongated clusters with alternating domains of each species. By developing a mean-field theory, we reveal the conditions for cluster formation and characterize the resulting patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of inter-species interactions in the emergence of complex ordered states.</description>

      <title>Topological flowscape reveals state transitions in nonreciprocal living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions-- where forces between entities are asymmetric-- govern a wide range of nonequilibrium phenomena, yet their role in structural transitions in living and active systems remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a transition between nonreciprocal states using starfish embryos at different stages of development, where interactions are inherently asymmetric and tunable. Experiments, interaction inference, and topological analysis yield a nonreciprocal state diagram spanning crystalline, flocking, and fragmented states, revealing that weak nonreciprocity promotes structural order while stronger asymmetry disrupts it. To capture these transitions, we introduce topological landscapes, mapping the distribution of structural motifs across state space. We further develop topological flowscapes, a dynamic framework that quantifies transitions between collective states and detects an informational rate shift from the experimental state transition. Together, these results establish a general approach for decoding nonequilibrium transitions and uncover how asymmetric interactions sculpt the dynamical and structural architecture of active and living matter.</description>

      <title>A Complex Topological Phase in C-Spin Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new theoretical model for active matter ("complementary-spins" or c-spins), exploring the interplay of positional and orientational order in mobile agents with rotational freedom, divided into two populations with contrasting interactions. The system's behavior depends on its size and a control parameter (circular anisotropy) that splits the agents' natural rotational frequencies. Key findings include distinct phases based on anisotropy: Small Anisotropy: Stable, regular equilibrium patterns emerge. Moderate Anisotropy: Formation of complex, non-equilibrium topological point defects (vortex states), which are bistable with uniform patterns. These robust, self-repairing defects exhibit counter-rotating c-spin loop trains, spin-momentum locking, and dissipationless flow, classified by a two-valued topological charge. High Anisotropy: Transition to active turbulence and loss of order. Statistical analysis reveals a double phase transition at a critical value: a standard symmetry-breaking transition and a novel topological phase transition activating the vortex complexes. Increasing system size enhances organizational complexity and the development of spin-momentum locked transport networks. This model provides a new framework for understanding robustness and morphogenesis in living systems.</description>
