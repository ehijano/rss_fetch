      <title>Exploring the Nuclear Shape Phase Transition in Ultra-Relativistic $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape phase transition for certain isotope or isotone chains, associated with the quantum phase transition of finite nuclei, is an intriguing phenomenon in nuclear physics. A notable case is the Xe isotope chain, where the structure transits from a $\gamma$-soft rotor to a spherical vibrator, with the second-order shape phase transition occurring in the vicinity of $^{128-130}$Xe. In this letter, we focus on investigating the $\gamma$-soft deformation of $^{129}$Xe associated with the second-order shape phase transition by constructing novel correlators for ultra-relativistic $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions. In particular, our iEBE-VISHNU model calculations show that the $v_2^2-[p_T]$ correlation $\rho_{2}$ and the mean transverse momentum fluctuation $\Gamma_{p_T}$, which were previously interpreted as the evidence for the rigid triaxial deformation of $^{129}$Xe, can also be well explained by the $\gamma$-soft deformation of $^{129}$Xe. We also propose two novel correlators $\rho_{4,2}$ and $\rho_{2,4}$, which carry non-trivial higher-order correlations and show unique capabilities to distinguish between the $\gamma$-soft and the rigid triaxial deformation of $^{129}$Xe in $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions at the LHC. The present study also provides a novel way to explore the second-order shape phase transition of finite nuclei with ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Gapless superfluidity in neutron stars: Thermal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interior of mature neutron stars is expected to contain superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons. The influence of temperature and currents on superfluid properties is studied within the self-consistent time-dependent nuclear energy-density functional theory. We find that this theory predicts the existence of a regime in which nucleons are superfluid (the order parameter remains finite) even though the energy spectrum of quasiparticle excitations exhibits no gap. We show that the disappearance of the gap leads to a specific heat that is not exponentially suppressed at low temperatures as in the BCS regime but can be comparable to that in the normal phase. Introducing some dimensionless effective superfluid velocity, we show that the behavior of the specific heat is essentially universal and we derive general approximate analytical formulas for applications to neutron-star cooling simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Meson Scattering on Spin Quantum Simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quenching and flow of charm and bottom quarks via semi-leptonic decay of $D$ and $B$ mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy flavor particles provide important probes of the microscopic structure and thermodynamic properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. We study the energy loss and flow of charm and bottom quarks inside the QGP via the nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) and elliptic flow coefficient ($v_2$) of their decayed leptons in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. The dynamical evolution of the QGP is performed using the (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics model CLVisc; the evolution of heavy quarks inside the QGP is simulated with our improved Langevin model that takes into account both collisional and radiative energy loss of heavy quarks; the hadronization of heavy quarks is simulated via our hybrid coalescence-fragmentation model; and the semi-leptonic decay of $D$ and $B$ mesons is simulated via PYTHIA. By using the same spatial diffusion coefficient for charm and bottom quarks, we obtain smaller $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and larger $v_2$ of charm decayed leptons than bottom decayed leptons, indicating stronger energy loss of charm quarks than bottom quarks inside the QGP within our current model setup.</description>

      <title>Spatially oscillating correlation functions in $\left(2+1\right)$-dimensional four-fermion models: The mixing of scalar and vector modes at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the mixing of scalar and vector condensates produces spatially oscillating, but exponentially damped correlation functions in fermionic theories at finite density and temperature. We find a regime exhibiting this oscillatory behavior in a Gross-Neveu-type model that also features vector interactions within the mean-field approximation. The existence of this regime aligns with expectations based on symmetry arguments, that are also applicable to QCD at finite baryon density. We compute the phase diagram including both homogeneous phases and regions with spatially oscillating, exponentially damped correlation functions at finite temperature and chemical potential for different strengths of the vector coupling. Furthermore, we find that inhomogeneous condensates are disfavored compared to homogeneous ones akin to previous findings without vector interactions. We show that our results are valid for a broad class of $\left(2+1\right)$-dimensional models with local four-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Vortex Phase and Magnetic Field Generation in QCD with Isospin and Baryon Chemical Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel baryonic vortex phase in low energy dense QCD with finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. It is known that the homogeneous charged pion condensate takes up the ground state in the presence of the isospin chemical potential, and therein arises the Abrikosov vortex lattice with an applied magnetic field. We first demonstrate that a vortex sustaining the same quantized magnetic flux as the conventional Abrikosov vortex, carries a baryon number captured by the third homotopy group of Skyrmions, given the added modulation of the neutral pion inside the vortex core. Such a state is therefore dubbed the baryonic vortex. We reveal that when the baryon chemical potential is above a critical value, the baryonic vortex has negative tension measured from the charged pion condensation. It implies the baryonic vortex phase would emerge spontaneously without any external magnetic field, and take over the ground state at high density. This new phase contributes to the comprehension of QCD phase diagram and could be relevant to the generation of magnetic fields inside neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum spectra and their multiplicity dependence serve as key tools for extracting parameters that can be compared with theoretical models. This comparison aims to establish the behaviour and nature of the system created in the collision. Over the past decade, the scientific community has extensively studied the possibility of a system analogous to quark-gluon plasma, predicted in heavy nuclei collisions, also existing in collisions involving light nuclei and proton-proton collisions. We have reanalysed the experimental data published by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC, exploring a seemingly universal feature of transverse momentum spectra of charged particles. We have identified a specific range where the contribution of the hard part is nonexistent for the studied multiplicities. We present the dependence of the mean transverse momenta obtained in the soft and soft+hard (mixes) parts and discuss the results in the context of the ongoing controversy regarding the existence of collectivity in small systems. Finally, we also discuss possible refinements of the analyses concerning the use of statistical parameters of higher order, aimed at better distinguishing the agreement of theoretical and Monte Carlo models with the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for studying the spin alignment $\rho_{00}$ for flavorless vector mesons by using the gauge/gravity duality. Focusing on the dilepton production through vector meson decay, we derive the relation between production rates at each spin channel and meson's spectral function, which can be evaluated by holographic models for a strongly coupled system. As examples, we study $\rho_{00}$ for $J/\psi$ and $\phi$ mesons, induced by the relative motion to a thermal background, within the soft-wall model. We show that $\rho_{00}$ in the helicity frame for $J/\psi$ and $\phi$ mesons have positive and negative deviations from 1/3 at $T=150$ MeV, respectively, which consequently leads to different properties for their global spin alignments.</description>

      <title>Using Equation of State Constraints to Classify Low-Mass Compact Binary Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact objects observed via gravitational waves are classified as black holes or neutron stars primarily based on their inferred mass with respect to stellar evolution expectations. However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, $\lesssim 1.2 \,M_\odot$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds $\sim 100:1$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 20$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds $\sim 10:1$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds $\gtrsim 5:1$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a $\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$ black hole with a $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star companion. On the other hand, classifying each individual binary component suffers from an inherent labeling ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Gapless neutron superfluidity can explain the late time cooling of transiently accreting neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current interpretation of the observed late time cooling of transiently accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries during quiescence requires the suppression of neutron superfluidity in their crust at variance with recent ab initio many-body calculations of dense matter. Focusing on the two emblematic sources KS~1731$-$260 and MXB~1659$-$29, we show that their thermal evolution can be naturally explained by considering the existence of a neutron superflow driven by the pinning of quantized vortices. Under such circumstances, we find that the neutron superfluid can be in a gapless state in which the specific heat is dramatically increased compared to that in the classical BCS state assumed so far, thus delaying the thermal relaxation of the crust. We have performed neutron-star cooling simulations taking into account gapless superfluidity and we have obtained excellent fits to the data thus reconciling astrophysical observations with microscopic theories. The imprint of gapless superfluidity on other observable phenomena is briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of QCD equation of state in external magnetic field and nonzero baryon density. Our study is carried out by means of lattice simulation with 2+1 dynamical staggered quarks at the physical masses. The simulation is conducted at imaginary baryon chemical potential what allowed us to overcome the sign problem. We expand the pressure in the baryon imaginary chemical potential and study three leading nonzero coefficients in this expansion. These coefficients were calculated for the following values of magnetic field: $eB=0.3$, $0.6$, $1.2$ GeV$^2$ with the lattice sizes $8\times32^3$, $10\times40^3$, $12\times48^3$. Using these data we take continuum limit for the coefficients. Our results indicate considerable enhancement of the expansion coefficients by the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics describes the properties of elementary particles and their interactions remarkably well, but in particular does not account for dark matter. Isotope-shift spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of fifth forces and new particles that illuminate the dark matter sector. This method sets bounds on new bosons that couple neutrons and electrons with masses in the keV/c2 to MeV/c2 range. With increasing spectroscopic precision, such searches are limited by uncertainties of isotope masses and the understanding of nuclear structure. Here, we report on high-precision mass-ratio and isotope-shift measurements of the ytterbium isotopes $^{168,170,172,174,176}$Yb that exceed previous measurements by up to two orders of magnitude. From these measurements, we extract higher-order changes in the nuclear charge distribution along the Yb isotope chain and use these to benchmark novel ab initio calculations. Our measurements set new bounds on the existence of the proposed boson.</description>

      <title>Estimating angular momenta of fission fragments from isomeric yield ratios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To deduce the angular momenta of fission fragments based on the observed isomeric yield ratios (IYR) in 25-MeV proton-induced fission of 238U and to compare these using Wilson's model. Method: A surrogate model of GEF has been developed to generate properties of primary fission fragments. Based on the excitation energy and angular momentum of fission fragments from GEF, an energy versus angular momentum matrix is reconstructed using a set of parameters. With such matrices as input, TALYS is used to calculate the de-excitation of the fission fragments, from which the IYRs are obtained. By varying one of the parameters, the root-mean-square angular momentum (Jrms), which determines the angular momentum distribution of the matrix, Jrms-dependent IYRs are obtained. Considering all primary fission fragments contributing to the IYR for a given fission product, the average angular momentum of those fragments is estimated. Results: Data of 31 IYRs in proton-induced fission of 238U were analysed. As a result, the average Jrms, equivalent to average angular momentum Jav, with uncertainties of 24 fission products, are presented. Considering the neutron emissions of the primary fission fragments, the Jav as a function of the primary fission fragment is presented. A mass dependency of Jav is observed in the proton-induced fission of 238U. Moreover, the Jav for A larger than 131 could be described by the parameterisation proposed by J. Wilson. In general, higher Jav are observed in the present work compared to those from Wilson et al. This is likely due to the higher excitation energy of the fissioning nuclei in this work compared to Wilson's. Furthermore, systematic measurements of the Jav of fission products in the symmetric mass region are presented for the first time. A decreasing trend with mass numbers is observed, which can not be explained by the proposal in Wilson's paper.</description>

      <title>Isolated photon production in $pp$ collisions at forward rapidities and high multiplicity events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production of isolated photons in high multiplicity events is investigated considering the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism. The associated cross-section for proton - proton collisions is estimated considering three distinct solutions of the Balitsky - Kovchegov (BK) equation and predictions for the normalized photon yield as a function of the multiplicities of co - produced charged particles are presented. We predict the increasing of the yield with the multiplicity, with the slope being smaller for larger rapidities. As the isolated photon production is not affected by the fragmentation process, a future experimental investigation of this process in current high energy hadronic colliders is ideal to test the treatment of high multiplicity events using the CGC formalism, previously applied only for the production of hadronic final states.</description>

      <title>Chiral kinetic theory with self-energy corrections and neutrino spin Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive the chiral kinetic theory for chiral fermions with collisions, including the self-energy corrections, from quantum field theories. We find that the Wigner functions and chiral kinetic equations receive both the classical and quantum corrections from the self-energies and their spacetime gradients. We also apply this formalism to study nonequilibrium neutrino transport due to the interaction with thermalized electrons and nucleons, as realized in core-collapse supernovae. We derive neutrino currents along magnetic fields and neutrino spin Hall effect induced by the density gradient at first order in the Fermi constant $G_{\rm F}$ for anisotropic neutrino distributions.</description>

      <title>Full-order mode analysis within a mutilated relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a detailed normal mode analysis is given based on the Boltzmann equation in mutilated relaxation time approximation (RTA). Within this linearized effective kinetic description, our analysis covers a full-order calculation in wavenumber $k$, being a generalization of usual hydrodynamic mode analysis to intermediate and short-wavelength region. Besides, the proposed normal mode analysis can give a natural classification of kinetic modes into collective modes and non-collective single particle excitations. In the case with a scale-independent relaxation time, the so-called behavior of hydrodynamic onset transitions is recovered \cite{Romatschke:2015gic}. However, for a general case with a scale dependent relaxation time, a clear classification broken down because the location of hydrodynamic modes is not well separated from non-hydrodynamic modes.</description>

      <title>Quark stars in $D_3$-$D_7$ holographic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates static and dynamical quark star properties within a $D_3-D_7$ holographic model. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for the quark matter equation of state obtained from the brane configuration. We determine the mass-radius diagram for a range of model parameters and compare with recent NICER observational data for the pulsars PSR J$0030+0451$ and PSR J$0740+6620$. Motivated by the GW170817 event detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, we also calculate the tidal deformability parameter obtained for each component of the binary star system. We show that quark stars composed of flavor-independent quark matter derived from the $D_3-D_7$ holographic model are not able to satisfy simultaneously the LIGO-Virgo and NICER astrophysical bounds.</description>

      <title>Inferring the initial condition for the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply Bayesian inference to determine the posterior likelihood distribution for the parameters describing the initial condition of the small-$x$ Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation at leading logarithmic accuracy. The HERA structure function data is found to constrain most of the model parameters well. In particular, we find that the HERA data prefers an anomalous dimension $\gamma\approx 1$ unlike in previous fits where $\gamma&gt;1$ which led to e.g. the unintegrated gluon distribution and the quark-target cross sections not being positive definite. The determined posterior distribution can be used to propagate the uncertainties in the non-perturbative initial condition when calculating any other observable in the Color Glass Condensate framework. We demonstrate this explicitly for the inclusive quark production cross section in proton-proton collisions and by calculating predictions for the nuclear modification factor for the $F_2$ structure function in the EIC and LHeC/FCC-he kinematics.</description>
