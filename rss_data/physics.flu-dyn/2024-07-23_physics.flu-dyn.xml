      <title>Particle image velocimetry and modelling of horizontal coherent liquid jets impinging on and draining down a vertical wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow patterns created by a coherent horizontal liquid jet impinging on a vertical wall atmoderate flow rates (jet flowrates 0.5-4.0 L min-1, jet velocities 2.6-21 m s-1) are studied withwater on glass, polypropylene and polymethylmethacrylate (acrylic, Perspex(R)) using a novelparticle image velicometry (PIV) technique employing nearly opaque fluid doped withartificial pearlescence to track surface velocity. Flow patterns similar to those reported inprevious studies are observed on each substrate: their dimensions differed owing to theinfluence of wall material on contact angle. The dimensions are compared with models for (i)the radial flow zone, reported by Wang et al. (2013b), and the part of the draining film belowthe jet impingement point where it narrows to a node. For (ii), the model presented by Mertenset al. (2005) is revised to include a simpler assumed draining film shape and an alternativeboundary condition accounting for surface tension effects acting at the film edge. This refinedmodel gives equally good or better fits to the experimental data. The effective contact anglewhich gives good agreement with the data is found to lie between the measured quasi-staticadvancing and receding contact angles, at approximately half the advancing value. The PIVmeasurements confirmed the existence of a thin fast moving film with radial flow surroundingthe point of impingement, and a wide draining film bounded by ropes of liquid below theimpingement point. While these measurements generally support the predictions of existingmodels, these models assume that the flow is steady. In contrast, surface waves were evident inboth regions and this partly explains the difference between the measured surface velocity andthe values estimated from the models.</description>

      <title>Computing Stokes flows in periodic channels via rational approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational approximation has proven to be a powerful method for solving two-dimensional (2D) fluid problems. At small Reynolds numbers, 2D Stokes flows can be represented by two analytic functions, known as Goursat functions. Xue, Waters and Trefethen [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46 (2024), pp. A1214-A1234] recently introduced the LARS algorithm (Lightning-AAA Rational Stokes) for computing 2D Stokes flows in general domains by approximating the Goursat functions using rational functions. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for computing 2D Stokes flows in periodic channels using trigonometric rational functions, with poles placed via the AAA-LS algorithm [Costa and Trefethen, European Congr. Math., 2023] in a conformal map of the domain boundary. We apply the algorithm to Poiseuille and Couette problems between various periodic channel geometries, where solutions are computed to at least 6-digit accuracy in less than 1 second. The applicability of the algorithm is highlighted in the computation of the dynamics of fluid particles in unsteady Couette flows.</description>

      <title>Hidden mechanism of dynamic large-eddy simulation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic model is one of the most successful inventions in subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling as it alleviates many drawbacks of the static coefficient SGS stress models. The model coefficient is often calculated dynamically through the minimization of the Germano-identity error (GIE). However, the driving mechanism behind the dynamic model's success is still not well understood. In wall-bounded flows, we postulate that the principal directions of the resolved rate-of-strain tensor play an important role in the dynamic models. Specifically, we find that minimization of the GIE along only the three principal directions (or less), in lieu of its nine components in its original formulation, produces equally comparable results as the original model when examined in canonical turbulent channel flows, a three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer, and a separating flow over periodic hills. This suggests that not all components of the Germano identity are equally important for the success of the dynamic model, and that there might be dynamically more important directions for modeling the subgrid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structured Input-Output Modeling and Robust Stability Analysis of Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced structured input-output analysis is a powerful method for capturing nonlinear phenomena associated with incompressible flows, and this paper extends that method to the compressible regime. The proposed method relies upon a reformulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which allows for an exact quadratic formulation of the dynamics of perturbations about a steady base flow. To facilitate the structured input-output analysis, a pseudo-linear model for the quadratic nonlinearity is proposed and the structural information of the nonlinearity is embedded into a structured uncertainty comprising unknown `perturbations'. The structured singular value framework is employed to compute the input-output gain, which provides an estimate of the robust stability margin of the flow perturbations, as well as the forcing and response modes that are consistent with the nonlinearity structure. The analysis is then carried out on a plane, laminar compressible Couette flow over a range of Mach numbers. The structured input-output gains identify an instability mechanism, characterized by a spanwise elongated structure in the streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space at a subsonic Mach number, that evolves into an oblique structure at sonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In addition, the structured input-output forcing and response modes provide insight into the thermodynamic and momentum characteristics associated with a source of instability. Comparisons with a resolvent/unstructured analysis reveal discrepancies in the distribution of input-output gains over the wavenumber space as well as in the modal behavior of an instability, thus highlighting the strong correlation between the structural information of the nonlinearity and the underlying flow physics.</description>

      <title>PyDDC: An Eulerian-Lagrangian simulator for density driven convection of $\mathrm{CO_2}$--brine systems in saturated porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PyDDC is a particle tracking reservoir simulator capable of solving non-linear density driven convection of single phase carbon-dioxide ($\mathrm{CO_2}$)--brine fluid mixture in saturated porous media at the continuum scale. In contrast to the sate-of-the-art Eulerian models, PyDDC uses a Lagrangian approach to simulate the Fickian transport of single phase solute mixtures. This introduces additional flexibility of incorporating anisotropic dispersion and benefits from having no numerical artifacts in its implementation. It also includes $\mathrm{CO_2}$--brine phase equilibrium models, developed by other researchers, to study the overall dynamics in the presence of electrolyte brine at different pressure and temperatures above the critical point of $\mathrm{CO_2}$. We demonstrate the implementation procedure in depth, outlining the overall structure of the numerical solver and its different attributes that can be used for solving specific tasks.</description>

      <title>Turbulent convection in rotating slender cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent convection in the interiors of the Sun and the Earth occurs at high Rayleigh numbers $Ra$, low Prandtl numbers $Pr$, and different levels of rotation rates. To understand the combined effects better, we study rotating turbulent convection for $Pr = 0.021$ (for which some laboratory data corresponding to liquid metals are available), and varying Rossby numbers $Ro$, using direct numerical simulations (DNS) in a slender cylinder of aspect ratio 0.1; this confinement allows us to attain high enough Rayleigh numbers. We are motivated by the earlier finding in the absence of rotation that heat transport at high enough $Ra$ is similar between confined and extended domains. We make comparisons with higher aspect ratio data where possible. We study the effects of rotation on the global transport of heat and momentum as well as flow structures (a) for increasing rotation at a few fixed values of $Ra$ and (b) for increasing $Ra$ (up to $10^{10}$) at the fixed, low Ekman number of $1.45 \times 10^{-6}$. We compare the results with those from unity $Pr$ simulations for the same range of $Ra$ and $Ro$, and with the non-rotating case over the same range of $Ra$ and low $Pr$. We find that the effects of rotation diminish with increasing $Ra$. These results and comparison studies suggest that, for high enough $Ra$, rotation alters convective flows in a similar manner for small and large aspect ratios, and so useful insights on the effects of high thermal forcing on convection can be obtained by considering slender domains.</description>

      <title>Error propagation of direct pressure gradient integration and a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition based pressure field reconstruction method for image velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering pressure fields from image velocimetry measurements has two general strategies: i) directly integrating the pressure gradients from the momentum equation and ii) solving or enforcing the pressure Poisson equation (divergence of the pressure gradients). In this work, we analyze the error propagation of the former strategy and provide some practical insights. For example, we establish the error scaling laws for the Pressure Gradient Integration (PGI) and the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE). We explain why applying the Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition (HHD) could significantly reduce the error propagation for the PGI. We also propose to use a novel HHD-based pressure field reconstruction strategy that offers the following advantages: i) effective processing of noisy scattered or structured image velocimetry data on a complex domain and ii) using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) with curl/divergence-free kernels to provide divergence-free correction to the velocity fields for incompressible flows and curl-free correction for pressure gradients. Complete elimination of divergence-free bias in measured pressure gradient and curl-free bias in the measured velocity field results in superior accuracy. Synthetic velocimetry data based on exact solutions and high-fidelity simulations are used to validate the analysis as well as demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the RBF-HHD solver.</description>

      <title>Experimental study on the relationship between extensional and shear rheology of low-viscosity power-law fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between extensional and shear viscosity of low-viscosity power-law fluids. We showed the first experimental evidence of the conditions satisfying the same power exponents for extensional and shear viscosity, as indicated by the Carreau model. The extensional and shear viscosity are respectively measured by capillary breakup extensional rheometry dripping-onto-substrate (CaBER-DoS) and by a shear rheometer for various Ohnesorge number Oh. The viscosity ranges measured were about O(10^0) to O(10^4) mPas for shear viscosity and O(10^1) to O(10^3) mPas for extensional viscosity. Our experimental results show that, at least for the range of Oh &gt; 1, the power-law expression for the liquid filament radius, extensional viscosity, and shear viscosity holds, even for low-viscosity fluids.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of attachment-line boundary layer in hypersonic flow, Part I: roughness-induced subcritical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attachment-line boundary layer is critical in hypersonic flows because of its significant impact on heat transfer and aerodynamic performance. In this study, high-fidelity numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the subcritical roughness-induced laminar-turbulent transition at the leading-edge attachment-line boundary layer of a blunt swept body under hypersonic conditions. This simulation represents a significant advancement by successfully reproducing the complete leading-edge contamination process induced by surface roughness elements in a realistic configuration, thereby providing previously unattainable insights. Two roughness elements of different heights are examined. For the lower-height roughness element, additional unsteady perturbations are required to trigger a transition in the wake, suggesting that the flow field around the roughness element acts as a disturbance amplifier for upstream perturbations. Conversely, a higher roughness element can independently induce the transition. A low-frequency absolute instability is detected behind the roughness, leading to the formation of streaks. The secondary instabilities of these streaks are identified as the direct cause of the final transition.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of attachment-line boundary layer in hypersonic flow, Part II: the features of three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study,we investigate the characteristics of three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers influenced by transverse flow and pressure gradients. Our findings reveal that even without assuming an infinite sweep, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer over the present swept blunt body maintains spanwise homogeneity, consistent with infinite sweep assumptions.We critically examine the law-of-the and temperature-velocity relationships, typically applied two-dimensional turbulent boundary layers, in three-dimensional contexts. Results show that with transverse velocity and pressure gradient, streamwise velocity adheres to classical velocity transformation relationships and the predictive accuracy of classical temperaturevelocity relationships diminishes because of pressure gradient. We show that near-wall streak structures persist and correspond with energetic structures in the outer region, though three-dimensional effects redistribute energy to align more with the external flow direction. Analysis of shear Reynolds stress and mean flow shear directions reveals in near-wall regions with low transverse flow velocity, but significant deviations at higher transverse velocities. Introduction of transverse pressure gradients together with the transverse velocities alter the velocity profile and mean flow shear directions, with shear Reynolds stress experiencing similar changes but with a lag increasing with transverse. Consistent directional alignment in outer regions suggests a partitioned relationship between shear Reynolds stress and mean flow shear: nonlinear in the inner region and approximately linear in the outer region.</description>

      <title>An implicit adaptive unified gas-kinetic scheme for steady-state solutions of non-equilibrium flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium flows have been frequently encountered in various aerospace engineering applications. To understand nonequilibrium physics, multiscale effects, and the dynamics in these applications, an effective and reliable multiscale scheme for all flow regimes is required. Following the direct modeling methodology, the adaptive unified gas-kinetic scheme employs discrete velocity space (DVS) to accurately capture the non-equilibrium physics, recovering the original unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), and adaptively employs continuous distribution functions based on the Chapman-Enskog expansion to achieve better efficiency. Different regions are dynamically coupled at the cell interface through the fluxes from the discrete and continuous gas distribution functions, thereby avoiding any buffer zone between them. In the current study, an implicit adaptive unified gas-kinetic scheme (IAUGKS) is constructed to further enhance the efficiency of steady-state solutions. The current scheme employs implicit macroscopic governing equations and couples them with implicit microscopic governing equations within the non-equilibrium region, resulting in high convergence efficiency in all flow regimes. A series of numerical tests were conducted for high Mach number flows around diverse geometries such as a cylinder, a sphere, an X-38-like vehicle, and a space station. The current scheme can capture the non-equilibrium physics and provide accurate predictions of surface quantities. In comparison with the original UGKS, the velocity space adaptation, unstructured DVS, and implicit iteration significantly improve the efficiency by one or two orders of magnitude. Given its exceptional efficiency and accuracy, the IAUGKS serves as an effective tool for nonequilibrium flow simulations.</description>

      <title>High-flexibility reconstruction of small-scale motions in wall turbulence using a generalized zero-shot learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel super-resolution (or SR) framework for generating high-resolution turbulent boundary layer (TBL) flow from low-resolution inputs. The framework combines a super-resolution generative adversarial neural network (SRGAN) with down-sampling modules (DMs), integrating the residual of the continuity equation into the loss function. DMs selectively filter out components with excessive energy dissipation in low-resolution fields prior to the super-resolution process. The framework iteratively applies the SRGAN and DM procedure to fully capture the energy cascade of multi-scale flow structures, collectively termed the SRGAN-based energy cascade framework (EC-SRGAN). Despite being trained solely on turbulent channel flow data (via "zero-shot transfer"), EC-SRGAN exhibits remarkable generalization in predicting TBL small-scale velocity fields, accurately reproducing wavenumber spectra compared to DNS results. Furthermore, a super-resolution core is trained at a specific super-resolution ratio. By leveraging this pre-trained super-resolution core, EC-SRGAN efficiently reconstructs TBL fields at multiple super-resolution ratios from various levels of low-resolution inputs, showcasing strong flexibility. By learning turbulent scale invariance, EC-SRGAN demonstrates robustness across different TBL datasets. These results underscore EC-SRGAN potential for generating and predicting wall turbulence with high flexibility, offering promising applications in addressing diverse TBL-related challenges.</description>

      <title>Inferring turbulent velocity and temperature fields and their statistics from Lagrangian velocity measurements using physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry-Thermometry (AIVT) method to infer hidden temperature fields from experimental turbulent velocity data. This physics-informed machine learning method enables us to infer continuous temperature fields using only sparse velocity data, hence eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. Specifically, AIVT is based on physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (not neural networks) and is trained by optimizing a combined loss function that minimizes the residuals of the velocity data, boundary conditions, and the governing equations. We apply AIVT to a unique set of experimental volumetric and simultaneous temperature and velocity data of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) that we acquired by combining Particle Image Thermometry and Lagrangian Particle Tracking. This allows us to compare AIVT predictions and measurements directly. We demonstrate that we can reconstruct and infer continuous and instantaneous velocity and temperature fields from sparse experimental data at a fidelity comparable to direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence. This, in turn, enables us to compute important quantities for quantifying turbulence, such as fluctuations, viscous and thermal dissipation, and QR distribution. This paradigm shift in processing experimental data using AIVT to infer turbulent fields at DNS-level fidelity is a promising avenue in breaking the current deadlock of quantitative understanding of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, where DNS is computationally infeasible.</description>

      <title>The Role of Helical and Non-Helical Drives on the evolution of Self-Consistent Dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the self-consistent dynamo limit, the magnetic feedback on the velocity field is sufficiently strong to induce a change in the topology of the magnetic field. Consequently, the magnetic energy reaches a state of non-linear saturation. Here, we investigate the role played by helical and non-helical drives in the triggering and the eventual saturation of a self-consistent dynamo. Evidence of small-scale dynamo (SSD) activity is found for both helical and non-helical forcing, driven at the largest possible scale. Based on the spectrum analysis, we find that the evolution of kinetic energy follows Kolmogorov's $k^-{\frac{5}{3}}$ law while that of magnetic energy follows Kazantsev's $k^{\frac{3}{2}}$ scaling. Also, we have verified that the aforementioned scalings remain valid for various magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm). Statistical analysis is found to support our numerical finds.</description>

      <title>Poiseuille Flow in Tubes of Bipolar Cross Sections: An exact hemodynamic analysis for potential mechanisms of aortopathy in bicuspid aortic valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15035</link>

Abstract: Steady blood flow, or Poiseuille flow, through compressed or defective blood vessels is a critical issue in hemodynamics, particularly in cardiovascular studies. This research explores a tube with a bipolar cross-section, simulating the geometry of a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) during an oval systolic opening. The BAV, typically featuring two cusps instead of the usual three found in normal tricuspid configurations, introduces unique hemodynamic challenges. As the most prevalent congenital heart defect, BAV increases the risk of aortic dilation and dissection. A bipolar cross-sectional analysis provides a more accurate geometric approximation for modeling flow through these atypical valve shapes, crucial for understanding the specific fluid dynamics associated with BAV. We derived an exact solution for the governing equations of Poiseuille flow within a bipolar cross-sectional tube, including velocity field, flow rate, and wall shear stress (WSS). The velocity profiles for BAV show remarkable agreement with previous studies using coherent multi-scale simulations, consistently demonstrating a jet-like flow structure absent in tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) scenarios. Analysis reveals that at the center of the entrance, BAV blood flow velocity is significantly higher than TAV but decreases more rapidly towards the vessel wall, creating a steeper vertical velocity gradient and resulting in higher WSS for BAV. Additionally, the WSS, inversely proportional to sin({\xi}*), where {\xi}* represents the bipolar coordinate at the wall boundary, exceeds that found in a circular cylindrical tube with an equivalent diameter. In cases of aortic valve stenosis, where {\xi}* approaches {\pi}, the WSS increases rapidly. This elevated WSS, commonly observed in BAV patients, may detrimentally impact the aortic wall in these structurally abnormal valves, particularly within the ascending aorta.</description>

      <title>Side-heated Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection</title>

Abstract: Unlike solids, the heat transfer in fluids can be greatly enhanced due to the presence of convection. Under gravity, an unevenly distributed temperature field results in differences in buoyancy, driving fluid motion that is seen in Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC). In RBC, the overall heat flux is found to have a power-law dependence on the imposed temperature difference, with enhanced heat transfer much beyond thermal conduction. In a bounded domain of fluid such as a cube, how RBC responds to thermal perturbations from the vertical sidewall is not clear. Will sidewall heating or cooling modify flow circulation and heat transfer? We address these questions experimentally by adding heat to one side of the RBC. Through careful flow, temperature, and heat flux measurements, the effects of adding side heating to RBC are examined and analyzed, where a further enhancement of flow circulation and heat transfer is observed. Our results also point to a direct and simple control of the classical RBC system, allowing further manipulation and control of thermal convection through sidewall conditions.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Immersed Boundaries via Volume Penalization in the Industrial Aeronautical Computational Fluid Dynamics Solver CODA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation and validation of an immersed boundary volume penalization method in the computational fluid dynamics solver CODA (from ONERA, DLR, and Airbus). Our goal is to model and simulate turbulent fluid flows in complex 3D aerodynamic configurations through the numerical solution of the Reynolds--averaged Navier--Stokes equations using the Spalart--Allmaras turbulent model. To do that, an immersed boundary method has been implemented in CODA and an efficient preprocessing tool for the construction of unstructured hexahedral meshes with adaptive mesh refinement around immersed geometries has been developed. We report several numerical examples, including subsonic and transonic flow past a NACA0012 airfoil, subsonic flow past an MDA30P30N multi-element airfoil, and subsonic flow around the NASA high-lift CRM aircraft. These simulations have been performed in the CODA solver with a second-order finite volume scheme as spatial discretization and an implicit backward Euler scheme based on the matrix-free GMRES block-Jacobi iterative method. The reported numerical simulations are in very good agreement with their corresponding experimental data. We conclude that the implemented immersed boundary method is efficient, flexible, and accurate and can therefore be used for aeronautical applications in industry.</description>

      <title>Odd viscosity suppresses intermittency in direct turbulent cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermittency refers to the broken self-similarity of turbulent flows caused by anomalous spatio-temporal fluctuations. In this Letter, we ask how intermittency is affected by a non-dissipative viscosity, known as odd viscosity (also Hall or gyro-viscosity), which appears in parity-breaking fluids such as magnetized polyatomic gases, electron fluids under magnetic field and spinning colloids or grains. Using a combination of Navier-Stokes simulations and theory, we show that intermittency is suppressed by odd viscosity at small scales. This effect is caused by parity-breaking waves, induced by odd viscosity, that break the multiple scale invariances of the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on this insight, we construct a two-channel helical shell model that reproduces the basic phenomenology of turbulent odd-viscous fluids including the suppression of anomalous scaling. Our findings illustrate how a fully developed direct cascade that is entirely self-similar can emerge below a tunable length scale, paving the way for designing turbulent flows with adjustable levels of intermittency.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of exit dynamics of a circular cylinder out of water and silicone oil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental investigations of the exit dynamics of a horizontal cylindrical object were performed in water and silicone oil (50 cSt). The fully immersed cylinder was initially at rest in a still fluid tank before being pushed (or pulled according to the measurement procedure) upwards at a constant velocity. Firstly, we demonstrate that these conditions are better satisfied for a large aspect ratio cylinder equipped with vertical side plates. Secondly, the influence of the initial depth on the liquid entrained and the wake generated by the cylinder is discussed. The deformation of the bath is found to be independent of the starting depth when the starting depth is larger than 6 times the cylinder diameter. In the present case, this criterion reflects also the finite acceleration of the cylinder to reach the determined constant exit velocity. Measurements in a range of exit speeds between 0.1 and 1 m/s indicate that the thickness of the liquid above the cylinder, when the cylinder starts crossing the interface, increases with the speed according to a logarithmic law of the Froude number. During the subsequent drainage, the evolution of the coated liquid thickness is found to first decrease exponentially with time just after the crossing of the interface. At later times, a change of regime occurs and the drainage follows the inverse of the square root of time irrespective of the crossing speed. Finally, the force necessary to maintain a constant exit speed during the motion of the cylinder inside and outside the bath is analyzed. This global measurement of the entrained liquid confirms the square root scaling of the thinning with time during the drainage process.</description>

      <title>Wave-kinetic dynamics of forced-dissipated turbulent internal gravity waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves are an essential feature of flows stratified media, such as oceans and atmospheres. To investigate their dynamics, we perform simulations of the forced-dissipated kinetic equation describing the evolution of the energy spectrum of weakly nonlinear internal gravity waves. During the early evolution, the three well-known non-local interactions, the Elastic Scattering, the Induced-Diffusion, and the Parametric Sub-Harmonic Instability, together with the Super-Harmonic Instability play a prominent role. In contrast, local interactions are responsible for anisotropic energy cascade on longer time scales. We reveal emergence of a condensate at small horizontal wavevectors that can be interpreted as a pure wave-wave interaction-mediated layering process. We also observe the dynamical formation of an energy spectrum compatible with the Garrett-Munk prediction.</description>

      <title>Acceleration fluctuations of dark matter and the origin of MOND acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the velocity and acceleration fluctuations and distributions of cold dark matter particles that involve long-range gravitational interactions. For comparison, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo random elastic collisions involving a short-range interaction, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant that follows a Maxwellian-Boltzmann distribution. Long-range gravity requires a broad size of haloes to be formed. Hierarchical structure formation proceeds through the merging of smaller haloes to form larger haloes, which facilitates a continuous energy cascade from small- to large-scale haloes at a constant rate of $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. The velocity fluctuation involves a critical velocity $u_c$, and the acceleration fluctuation involves a critical acceleration $a_c$. The two critical quantities are related by the rate of the energy cascade as $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -{a_c u_c/[2(3\pi)^2]}$, where the factor $3\pi$ is from the angle of incidence during the merging. With a typical velocity dispersion of $u_c$ on the order of 500km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is found to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ at $z=0$ with a redshift dependence $a_{c} \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ that is greater at higher redshift. This suggests that the critical acceleration $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0 \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The redshift evolution of $a_0 \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ is also proposed and validated by this work, Magneticum, and EAGLE simulations. Future work on the high-redshift Tully-Fisher relation will provide more insight. A notable coincidence of dark energy density $\rho_{\Lambda} \propto {a_{c0}^{2}/G}$ might suggest an entropic origin of dark energy from the fluctuations of dark matter accelerations.</description>

      <title>Strong Bow Shocks: Turbulence and An Exact Self-Similar Asymptotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that strong bow shocks are turbulent and non-universal near the head, but asymptote to a universal steady, self-similar, and analytically solvable flow in the downstream. The turbulence is essentially 3D, and has been confirmed by a 3D simulation. The asymptotic behavior is confirmed with high resolution 2D and 3D simulations of a cold uniform wind encountering both a solid spherical obstacle and stellar wind. This solution is relevant in the context of: (i) probing the kinematic properties of observed high-velocity compact bodies -- e.g., runaway stars and/or supernova ejecta blobs -- flying through the interstellar medium; and (ii) constraining stellar bow shock luminosities invoked by some quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) models.</description>

      <title>Tunable transport in bi-disperse porous materials with vascular structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transport in synthetic, bi-disperse porous structures, with arrays of microchannels interconnected by a nanoporous layer. These structures are inspired by the xylem tissue in vascular plants, in which sap water travels from the roots to the leaves to maintain hydration and carry micronutrients. We experimentally evaluate transport in three conditions: high pressure-driven flow, spontaneous imbibition, and transpiration-driven flow. The latter case resembles the situation in a living plant, where bulk liquid water is transported upwards in a metastable state (negative pressure), driven by evaporation in the leaves; here we report stable, transpiration-driven flows down to $\sim -15$ MPa of driving force. By varying the shape of the microchannels, we show that we can tune the rate of these transport processes in a predictable manner, using a simple analytical (effective medium) approach and numerical simulations of the flow field in the bi-disperse media. We also show that the spontaneous imbibition behavior of a single structure - with fixed geometry - can behave very differently depending on its preparation (filled with air, vs. evacuated), because of a dramatic change in the conductance of vapor in the microchannels; this change offers a second way to tune the rate of transport in bi-disperse, xylem-like structures, by switching between air-filled and evacuated states.</description>

      <title>Simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics in the vicinity of a critical endpoint belonging to the universality class of the Ising model. This study is motivated by the challenge of modeling the dynamics of critical fluctuations near a conjectured critical endpoint in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We focus on the interaction of shear modes with a conserved scalar density, which is known as model H. We show that the observed dynamical scaling behavior depends on the correlation length and the shear viscosity of the fluid. As the correlation length is increased or the viscosity is decreased we observe a cross-over from the dynamical exponent of critical diffusion, $z\simeq 4$, to the expected scaling exponent of model H, $z\simeq 3$. We use our method to investigate time-dependent correlation function of non-Gaussian moments $M^n(t)$ of the order parameter. We find that the relaxation time depends in non-trivial manner on the power $n$.</description>
