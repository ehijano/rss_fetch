      <title>On Nonlinear Inertial Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often assumed that the most general transformation between two inertial reference frames is affine linear in their Cartesian coordinates, an assumption which is however not true. We provide a complete derivation of the most general inertial frame transformation, which is indeed nonlinear; along the way, we shall find that the conditions of preserving the Law of Inertia take the form of Schwarzian differential equations, providing perhaps the simplest possible physics setting in which the Schwarzian derivative appears. We then demonstrate that the most general such inertial transformation which further preserves the speed of light in all directions is, however, still affine linear. Physically, this paper may be viewed as a reduction of the number of postulates needed to uniquely specify special relativity by one, as well as a proof that inertial transformations automatically imbue spacetime with a vector space structure, albeit in one higher dimension than might be expected. Mathematically, this paper may be viewed as a derivation of the higher-dimensional analog of the Schwarzian differential equation and its most general solution.</description>

      <title>Radiation forces and torques in optics and acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical action of various kinds of waves has been recognized for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the turn of the 20th century, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second surge occurred in the past several decades, driven by technological breakthroughs: the invention of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wave fields. This resulted in major discoveries, including optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic manipulation of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Nowadays, radiation forces and torques underpin numerous applications: optical and acoustic tweezers, acoustofluidic sorting of biological cells, optomechanical systems operating in both classical and quantum regimes, solar sails, quantum simulators, volumetric displays, etc. In this review, we present a unifying perspective on optical and acoustic forces and torques acting on various particles, addressing both their theoretical foundations and key applications. Our approach relies on the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities of wave fields and the principal forces and torques exerted on small particles. Moreover, we describe important cases of nontrivial (e.g., lateral and pulling) forces and complex (e.g., chiral and anisotropic) particles. We also highlight significant experimental achievements involving optical and acoustic manipulation in structured wave fields. Our aim is to illuminate the common fundamental origins and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and advancing the development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.</description>
