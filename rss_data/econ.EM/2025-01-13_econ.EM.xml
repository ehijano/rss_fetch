      <title>Forecasting Symmetric Random Walks: A Fusion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14469v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting random walks is notoriously challenging, with na\"ive prediction serving as a difficult-to-surpass baseline. To investigate the potential of using movement predictions to improve point forecasts in this context, this study focuses on symmetric random walks, in which the target variable's future value is reformulated as a combination of its future movement and current value. The proposed forecasting method, termed the fusion of movement and na\"ive predictions (FMNP), is grounded in this reformulation. The simulation results show that FMNP achieves statistically significant improvements over na\"ive prediction, even when the movement prediction accuracy is only slightly above 0.50. In practice, movement predictions can be derived from the comovement between an exogenous variable and the target variable and then linearly combined with the na\"ive prediction to generate the final forecast. FMNP effectiveness was evaluated on four U.S. financial time series -- the close prices of Boeing (BA), Brent crude oil (OIL), Halliburton (HAL), and Schlumberger (SLB) -- using the open price of the Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) index as the exogenous variable. In all the cases, FMNP outperformed the na\"ive prediction, demonstrating its efficacy in forecasting symmetric random walks and its potential applicability to other forecasting tasks.</description>

      <title>Treatment effects without multicollinearity? Temporal order and the Gram-Schmidt process in causal inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper incorporates information about the temporal order of regressors to estimate orthogonal and economically interpretable regression coefficients. We establish new finite sample properties for the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process. Coefficients are unbiased and stable with lower standard errors than those from Ordinary Least Squares. We provide conditions under which coefficients represent average total treatment effects on the treated and extend the model to groups of ordered and simultaneous regressors. Finally, we reanalyze two studies that controlled for temporally ordered and collinear characteristics, including race, education, and income. The new approach expands Bohren et al.'s decomposition of systemic discrimination into channel-specific effects and improves significance levels.</description>

      <title>Testing the Fairness-Accuracy Improvability of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04816v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many organizations use algorithms that have a disparate impact, i.e., the benefits or harms of the algorithm fall disproportionately on certain social groups. Addressing an algorithm's disparate impact can be challenging, however, because it is often unclear whether it is possible to reduce this impact without sacrificing other objectives of the organization, such as accuracy or profit. Establishing the improvability of algorithms with respect to multiple criteria is of both conceptual and practical interest: in many settings, disparate impact that would otherwise be prohibited under US federal law is permissible if it is necessary to achieve a legitimate business interest. The question is how a policy-maker can formally substantiate, or refute, this "necessity" defense. In this paper, we provide an econometric framework for testing the hypothesis that it is possible to improve on the fairness of an algorithm without compromising on other pre-specified objectives. Our proposed test is simple to implement and can be applied under any exogenous constraint on the algorithm space. We establish the large-sample validity and consistency of our test, and microfound the test's robustness to manipulation based on a game between a policymaker and the analyst. Finally, we apply our approach to evaluate a healthcare algorithm originally considered by Obermeyer et al. (2019), and quantify the extent to which the algorithm's disparate impact can be reduced without compromising the accuracy of its predictions.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Heteroskedasticity in Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear regressions with endogeneity are widely used to estimate causal effects. This paper studies a framework that has two common issues, endogeneity of the regressors, and heteroskedasticity that is allowed to depend on endogenous regressors, i.e., endogenous heteroskedasticity. We show that the presence of such conditional heteroskedasticity in the structural regression renders the two-stages least squares estimator inconsistent. To solve this issue, we propose sufficient conditions together with a control function approach to identify and estimate the causal parameters of interest. We establish the limiting properties of the estimator, say consistency and asymptotic normality, and propose inference procedures. Monte Carlo simulations provide evidence of the finite sample performance of the proposed methods, and evaluate different implementation procedures. We revisit an empirical application about job training to illustrate the methods.</description>
