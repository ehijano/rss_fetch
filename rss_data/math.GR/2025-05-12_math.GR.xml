      <title>Quasi-redirecting boundaries of groups with linear divergence and 3-manifold groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-redirecting (QR) boundary, introduced by Qing and Rafi, generalizes the Gromov boundary for studying the large-scale geometry of finitely generated groups. Although it is not known to exist for all such groups, its existence has been established for several important classes. We prove that if a finitely generated group G has linear divergence, its QR-boundary is well-defined and consists of a single point. In addition, we show that all finitely generated 3-manifold groups admit well-defined QR-boundaries.</description>

      <title>On left nilpotent skew braces of class 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this article is to initiate a detailed structure theory of left nilpotent skew braces $B$ of class $2$, i.e. skew braces with $B^3 = 0$. We prove that if $B$ is of nilpotent type, then $B$ is centrally nilpotent. In fact, we show that $B$ is right nilpotent of class at most $2+mr$, i.e. $B^{(2+mr+1)} = 0$, where $m$ and $r$ are the nilpotency classes of the additive group of $B$ and $B^2$, respectively. If $B$ is of abelian type, then $B$ is actually right nilpotent of class $3$, i.e. $B^{(4)} = 0$, and this bound is best possible.</description>

      <title>Property FA for random $\ell$-gonal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the binomial $\ell$-gonal model for random groups, where the random relations all have fixed length $\ell\geq 3$ and the number of generators goes to infinity, we establish a double threshold near density $d=\frac{1}{\ell}$ where the group goes from being free to having Serre's property FA.
  As a consequence, random $\ell$-gonal groups at densities $\frac{1}{\ell} &lt; d&lt; \frac{1}{2}$ have boundaries homeomorphic to the Menger sponge, and $\frac{1}{\ell}$ is also the threshold for finiteness of $\mathrm{Out}(G)$. We also see that the thresholds for property FA and Kazhdan's property (T) differ when $\ell \geq 4$.
  Our methods are inspired by work of Antoniuk-Luczak-\'Swi\k{a}tkowski and Dahmani-Guirardel-Przytycki.</description>

      <title>Subgroup mixing in Baumslag-Solitar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we contribute to the study of the dynamics induced by the conjugation action on the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups BS(m,n), via the mixing properties of elements asymptotically produced by suitable random walks on the group. In an acylindrically hyperbolic context, the authors of [HMO] demonstrated strong mixing situations, namely topological mu-mixing, a strengthening of high topological transitivity. Regarding non-metabelian and non-unimodular BS(m,n), we exhibit here a radically different situation on each of the pieces except one of the partition introduced in [CGLMS22] (although it is highly topologically transitive on each piece). On the other hand, when BS(m,n) is unimodular, we demonstrate the topological mu-mixing character on each of the pieces.</description>

      <title>Nonamenable Poisson zoo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Poisson zoo on an infinite Cayley graph $G$, we take a probability measure $\nu$ on rooted finite connected subsets, called lattice animals, and place i.i.d. Poisson($\lambda$) copies of them at each vertex. If the expected volume of the animals w.r.t. $\nu$ is infinite, then the whole $G$ is covered for any $\lambda&gt;0$. If the second moment of the volume is finite, then it is easy to see that for small enough $\lambda$ the union of the animals has only finite clusters, while for $\lambda$ large enough there are also infinite clusters. Here we show that:
  1. If $G$ is a nonamenable free product, then for ANY $\nu$ with infinite second but finite first moment and any $\lambda&gt;0$, there will be infinite clusters, despite having arbitrarily low density.
  2. The same result holds for ANY nonamenable $G$, when the lattice animals are worms: random walk pieces of random finite length.
  It remains open if the result holds for ANY nonamenable Cayley graph with ANY lattice animal measure $\nu$ with infinite second moment.
  3. We also give a Poisson zoo example $\nu$ on $\mathbb{T}_d \times \mathbb{Z}^5$ with finite first moment and a UNIQUE infinite cluster for any $\lambda&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Metrics for quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quandle is an algebraic system originating in knot theory, which can be regarded as a generalization of the conjugation of groups. This structure naturally defines two subgroups of its automorphism group, which are called the inner automorphism group and the displacement group, and they act on the quandle from the right. For a quandle with such groups being finitely generated, we investigate the graph structures induced from the actions, and induced metric spaces. The graph structures are defined by the notion of the Schreier graph, which is a natural generalization of the Cayley graph for a group. In particular, the metric associated with the displacement group for an important class of quandles, namely, generalized Alexander quandles, is studied in detail. We show that such a metric space is quasi-isometric to the displacement group with a word metric. Finally, we provide some examples quasi-isometric to typical metric spaces.</description>

      <title>A completeness criterion for the common divisor graph on $p$-regular class sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite $p$-separable group, for some fixed prime $p$. Let $\Gamma_p(G)$ be the common divisor graph built on the set of sizes of $p$-regular conjugacy classes of $G$: this is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are the class sizes of those non-central elements of $G$ such that $p$ does not divide their order, and two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if they are not coprime. In this note we prove that if $\Gamma_p(G)$ is a $k$-regular graph with $k\geq 1$, then it is a complete graph with $k+1$ vertices. We also pose a conjecture regarding the order of products of $p$-regular elements with coprime conjugacy class sizes, whose validity would enable to drop the $p$-separability hypothesis.</description>

      <title>On boundaries of bicombable spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate systematic study of EZ-structures (and associated boundaries) of groups acting on spaces that admit consistent and conical (equivalently, consistent and convex) geodesic bicombings. Such spaces recently drew a lot of attention due to the fact that many classical groups act `nicely' on them. We rigorously construct EZ-structures, discuss their uniqueness (up to homeomorphism), provide examples, and prove some boundary-related features analogous to the ones exhibited by CAT(0) spaces and groups, which form a subclass of the discussed class of spaces and groups.</description>

      <title>A generalized character related to the local structure and representation theory of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the generalized character $\Psi_{1,p,G}$ of a finite group $G$ which vanishes on all $p$-singular elements of $G$ and whose value at each $p$-regular $y \in G$ is the number of $p$-elements of $C_{G}(y)$. We conjecture that this is always a character, and may be afforded by a projective $RG$-module, where $R$ is an appropriate complete discrete valuation ring whose residue field has characteristic $p$. We examine a number of case where this is the case, and consider consequences for the representation theory and character theory of $G$ when this conjecture is known to hold. In particular, we prove, among other things, that the conjecture is valid for all primes $p$ in the case that $G \cong {\rm PSL}(2,q)$ or ${\rm SL}(2,q)$ for every prime power $q$.</description>
