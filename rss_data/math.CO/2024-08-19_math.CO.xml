      <title>Graphs of maximum average degree less than $\frac {11}{3}$ are flexibly $4$-choosable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the flexible list coloring problem, in which we have a graph $G$, a color list assignment $L:V(G) \rightarrow 2^{\mathbb N}$, and a set $U \subseteq V(G)$ of vertices such that each $u \in U$ has a preferred color $p(u) \in L(u)$. Given a constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the problem asks for an $L$-coloring of $G$ in which at least $\varepsilon |U|$ vertices in $U$ receive their preferred color. We use a method of reducible subgraphs to approach this problem. We develop a vertex-partitioning tool that, when used with a new reducible subgraph framework, allows us to define large reducible subgraphs. Using this new tool, we show that if $G$ has maximum average degree less than $\frac{11}{3}$, a list $L(v)$ of size $4$ at each $v \in V(G)$, and a set $U \subseteq V(G)$ of vertices with preferred colors, then there exists an $L$-coloring of $G$ for which at least $2^{-145} |U|$ vertices of $U$ receive their preferred color.</description>

      <title>Homology of Segre products of Boolean and subspace lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segre products of posets were defined by Bj\"orner and Welker [J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 198(1-3), 43--55 (2005)]. We investigate the $t$-fold Segre product of the Boolean lattice $B_n$ and the subspace lattice $B_n(q)$. The case $t=2$ was considered by Yifei Li in [Alg. Comb. 6 (2), 457--469, 2023]. We describe how to construct an EL-labeling for the $t$-fold Segre product $P^{(t)}=P\circ \cdots \circ P$ ($t$ factors) from an EL-labeling of a pure poset $P$. We develop an extension of the product Frobenius characteristic defined by Li to examine the action of the $t$-fold direct product of the symmetric group on the homology of rank-selected subposets of $B_n^{(t)}$, giving an explicit formula for the decomposition into irreducibles for the homology of the full poset. We show that the stable principal specialisation of the associated Frobenius characteristics coincides with the corresponding rank-selected invariants for the subspace lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first general constructions of even length quaternary Legendre pairs: there is a quaternary Legendre pair of length $(q-1)/2$ for every prime power $q$ congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, and there is a quaternary Legendre pair of length $2p$ for every odd prime $p$ for which $2p-1$ is a prime power.</description>

      <title>Short proof of the hypergraph container theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a short and simple proof of the celebrated hypergraph container theorem of Balogh--Morris--Samotij and Saxton--Thomason. On a high level, our argument utilises the idea of iteratively taking vertices of largest degree from an independent set and constructing a hypergraph of lower uniformity which preserves independent sets and inherits edge distribution. The original algorithms for constructing containers also remove in each step vertices of high degree which are not in the independent set. Our modified algorithm postpones this until the end, which surprisingly results in a significantly simplified analysis.</description>

      <title>Rainbow perfect matchings in 3-partite 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m,n,r,s$ be nonnegative integers such that $n\ge m=3r+s$ and $1\leq s\leq 3$. Let \[\delta(n,r,s)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} n^2-(n-r)^2 &amp;\text{if}\ s=1 , \\[5pt]
  n^2-(n-r+1)(n-r-1) &amp;\text{if}\ s=2,\\[5pt] n^2 - (n-r)(n-r-1) &amp;\text{if}\ s=3. \end{array}\right.\]
  We show that there exists a constant $n_0 &gt; 0$ such that if $F_1,\ldots, F_n$ are 3-partite 3-graphs with $n\ge n_0$ vertices in each partition class and minimum vertex degree of $F_i$ is at least $\delta(n,r,s)+1$ for $i \in [n]$ then $\{F_1,\ldots,F_n\}$ admits a rainbow perfect matching. This generalizes a result of Lo and Markstr\"om on the vertex degree threshold for the existence of perfect matchings in 3-partite 3-graphs. In this proof, we use a fractional rainbow matching theory obtained by Aharoni et al. to find edge-disjoint fractional perfect matching.</description>

      <title>On odd covers of cliques and disjoint unions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Babai and Frankl posed the ``odd cover problem" of finding the minimum cardinality of a collection of complete bipartite graphs such that every edge of the complete graph of order $n$ is covered an odd number of times. In a previous paper with O'Neill, some of the authors proved that this value is always $\lceil n / 2 \rceil$ or $\lceil n / 2 \rceil + 1$ and that it is the former whenever $n$ is a multiple of $8$. In this paper, we determine this value to be $\lceil n / 2 \rceil$ whenever $n$ is odd or equivalent to $18$ modulo $24$. We also further the study of odd covers of graphs which are not complete, wherein edges are covered an odd number of times and nonedges an even number of times by the complete bipartite graphs in the collection. Among various results on disjoint unions, we find the minimum cardinality of an odd cover of a union of odd cliques and of a union of cycles.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walks on quadratic unitary Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic unitary Cayley graph $\mathcal{G}_{\Zl_n}$ has vertex set $\mathbb{Z}_n: =\{0,1, \hdots ,n-1\}$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if and only if $u - v$ or $v-u$ is a square of some units in $\mathbb{Z}_n$. This paper explores the periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walks on quadratic unitary Cayley graphs. We determine all periodic quadratic unitary Cayley graphs. From our results, it follows that there are infinitely many integral as well as non-integral graphs that are periodic. Additionally, we also determine the values of $n$ for which the quadratic unitary Cayley graph $\mathcal{G}_{\Zl_n}$ exhibits perfect state transfer.</description>

      <title>Variants of Conway Checkers and k-nacci Jumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conway Checkers is a game played with a checker placed in each square of the lower half of an infinite checkerboard. Pieces move by jumping over an adjacent checker, removing the checker jumped over. Conway showed that it is not possible to reach row 5 in finitely many moves by weighting each cell in the board by powers of the golden ratio such that no move increases the total weight. Other authors have considered the game played on many different boards, including generalising the standard game to higher dimensions. We work on a board of arbitrary dimension, where we allow a cell to hold multiple checkers and begin with m checkers on each cell. We derive an upper bound and a constructive lower bound on the height that can be reached, such that the upper bound almost never fails to be equal to the lower bound. We also consider the more general case where instead of jumping over 1 checker, each checker moves by jumping over k checkers, and again show the maximum height reachable lies within bounds that are almost always equal.</description>

      <title>When invariance implies exchangeability (and applications to invariant Keisler measures)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of when, given a homogeneous structure $M$ and a space $S$ of expansions of $M$, every $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant probability measure on $S$ is exchangeable (i.e. $S_\infty$-invariant). We define a condition of $k$-overlap closedness on $M$ which implies exchangeability of random expansions by a class of structures whose finite substructures are all contained in a hereditary class with labelled growth-rate $O(e^{n^{k+\delta}})$ for all $\delta&gt;0$. For example, the generic tetrahedron-free $3$-hypergraph is $2$-overlap closed and so all of its random expansions by graphs are exchangeable. Our more general results on $k$-overlap closedness for homogeneous structures imply the same for every finitely bounded homogeneous $3$-hypergraph with free amalgamation. Our results extend and recover both the work of Angel, Kechris and Lyons on invariant random orderings of homogeneous structures and some of the work of Crane and Towsner, and Ackerman on relatively exchangeable structures. We also study conditions under which there are non-exchangeable invariant random expansions looking at the universal homogeneous kay-graphs.
  In the second part of the paper we apply our results to study invariant Keisler measures in homogeneous structures. We prove that invariant Keisler measures can be viewed as a particular kind of invariant random expansion. Thus, we describe the spaces of invariant Keisler measures of various homogeneous structures, obtaining the first results of this kind since the work of Albert and Ensley. We also show there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ supersimple homogeneous ternary structures for which there are non-forking formulas which are universally measure zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of decision trees for percolation inequalities started with the celebrated O'Donnell--Saks--Schramm--Servedio (OSSS) inequality. We prove decision tree generalizations of the Harris--Kleitman (HK), van den Berg--Kesten (vdBK), and other inequalities. These inequalities are then applied to estimate the connection probabilities in Bernoulli bond percolation on general graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Endowed with the binary operation of set addition, the family $\mathcal P_{{\rm fin},0}(\mathbb N)$ of all finite subsets of $\mathbb N$ containing $0$ forms a monoid, with the singleton $\{0\}$ as its neutral element.
  We show that the only non-trivial automorphism of $\mathcal P_{{\rm fin},0}(\mathbb N)$ is the involution $X \mapsto \max X - X$. The proof leverages ideas from additive number theory and proceeds through an unconventional induction on what we call the boxing dimension of a finite set of integers, that is, the smallest number of (discrete) intervals whose union is the set itself.</description>

      <title>Unrestricted Red Size and Sign-Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unrestricted red size of a quiver is the maximal number of red vertices in its framed quiver after any given mutation sequence. In a 2023 paper by E. Bucher and J. Machacek, it was shown that connected, mutation-finite quivers either have an unrestricted red size of $n-1$ or $n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the quiver. We prove here that the same holds for the connected, mutation-infinite case using forks. As such, the unrestricted red size for any quiver equals $n-c$, where $c$ is the number of connected components of the quiver that do not admit a reddening sequence. Additionally, we prove a result on the $c$-vectors of forks that allows us to show that the $c$-vectors of both abundant acyclic quivers on any number of vertices and mutation-cyclic quivers on three vertices are sign-coherent with only elementary methods.</description>

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stefan Mandel is the man who won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. Calculations indicate that he took residual risks that his method might fail. Residual risks explain why he changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5)- and (49, 6, 6, 5)-lottery schemes shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades, triggered by growing computing power, and eventually triggered by Stefan Mandel's publicity and successes in the field. But, as the comparison with actual covering designs reveals, Stefan Mandel most likely pioneered in constructing a (15, 6, 5)-covering design many years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery.</description>

      <title>Gamma vectors as inverted Chebyshev expansions, type A to B transformations, and connections to algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a reciprocal/palindromic polynomial of even degree, we show that the gamma vector is essentially given by an inverted Chebyshev polynomial basis expansion. As an immediate consequence, we characterize real-rootedness of a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials in terms of real-rootedness of that of the reciprocal polynomial built out of an inverted scaled tuple of the coefficients with one fixed and the rest divided by 2. It can be taken as a counterpart to a recent result of Bel-Afia--Meroni--Telen on hyperbolicity of Chebyshev curves with respect to the origin. Apart from this, the inverted Chebyshev expansion also yields connections between intrinsic properties of the gamma vector construction and the geometric combinatorics of simplicial complexes and posets.
  We find this by applying work of Hetyei on Tchebyshev subdivisions and Tchebyshev posets. In particular, we find that the gamma vector transformation is closely related to $f$-vectors of simplicial complexes resulting from successive edge subdivisions that transform the type A Coxeter complex to the type B Coxeter complex. Lifting to this to the level of $ce$-indices (a modification of $cd$-indices), we show that the gamma vector inverted Chebyshev polynomial expansion lifts to a sum of $ce$-indices of cross polytope triangulations which can be computed using descent statistics involving edge labelings of maximal chains. While there are many examples in the literature where gamma positivity involving descent statistics, it is interesting to note that we have this without initial structural assumptions on the input polynomial apart from being reciprocal/palindromic. Finally, we note that all of these can be repeated with Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind after taking derivatives and that this gives connections to Hopf algebras and quasisymmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14281v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation are used in communications and remote sensing for synchronization and ranging. The autocorrelation demerit factor of a sequence is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its autocorrelation values at every nonzero shift when we normalize the sequence to have unit Euclidean length. The merit factor, introduced by Golay, is the reciprocal of the demerit factor. We consider the uniform probability measure on the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of the demerit factors of these sequences. Sarwate and Jedwab have respectively calculated the mean and variance of this distribution. We develop new combinatorial techniques to calculate the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor for binary sequences of length $\ell$. These techniques prove that for $p\geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$, all the central moments are strictly positive. For any given $p$, one may use the technique to obtain an exact formula for the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor as a function of the length $\ell$. Jedwab's formula for variance is confirmed by our technique with a short calculation, and we go beyond previous results by also deriving an exact formula for the skewness. A computer-assisted application of our method also obtains exact formulas for the kurtosis, which we report here, as well as the fifth central moment.</description>

      <title>On Rank-Monotone Graph Operations and Minimal Obstruction Graphs for the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP Hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytopes of graphs with respect to the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$, with a particular focus on finding and characterizing the smallest graphs with a given $\text{LS}_+$-rank (the needed number of iterations of the $\text{LS}_+$ operator on the fractional stable set polytope to compute the stable set polytope). We introduce a generalized vertex-stretching operation that appears to be promising in generating $\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs and study its properties. We also provide several new $\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs, most notably the first known instances of $12$-vertex graphs with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $4$, which provides the first advance in this direction since Escalante, Montelar, and Nasini's discovery of a $9$-vertex graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $3$ in 2006.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal P(S)$ be the semigroup obtained by equipping the family of all non-empty subsets of a (multiplicatively written) semigroup $S$ with the operation of setwise multiplication induced by $S$ itself. We call a subsemigroup $P$ of $\mathcal P(S)$ downward complete if any element of $S$ lies in at least one set $X \in P$ and any non-empty subset of a set in $P$ is still in $P$.
  We obtain, for a commutative semigroup $S$, a characterization of the cancellative elements of a downward complete subsemigroup of $\mathcal P(S)$ in terms of the cancellative elements of $S$. Consequently, we show that, if $H$ and $K$ are cancellative semigroups and either of them is commutative, then every isomorphism from a downward complete subsemigroup of $\mathcal P(H)$ to a downward complete subsemigroup of $\mathcal P(K)$ restricts to an isomorphism from $H$ to $K$. This solves a special case of a problem of Tamura and Shafer from the late 1960s and generalizes a recent result by Bienvenu and Geroldinger, where it is assumed, among other conditions, that $H$ and $K$ are numerical monoids.</description>
