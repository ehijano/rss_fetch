      <title>Window observables for benchmarking parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global analysis of collider and fixed-target experimental data and calculations from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are used to gain complementary information on the structure of hadrons. We propose novel ``window observables'' that allow for higher precision cross-validation between the different approaches, a critical step for studies that wish to combine the datasets. Global analyses are limited by the kinematic regions accessible to experiment, particularly in a range of Bjorken-$x$, and lattice QCD calculations also have limitations requiring extrapolations to obtain the parton distributions. We provide two different ``window observables'' that can be defined within a region of $x$ where extrapolations and interpolations in global analyses remain reliable and where lattice QCD results retain sensitivity and precision.</description>

      <title>$\eta_c\eta_c$ and $J/\psi J/\psi$ scatterings from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $J^{PC}=(0,2)^{++}$ $\eta_c \eta_c$ and $J/\psi J/\psi$ scatterings in $N_f=2$ lattice QCD at two pion masses $m_\pi\approx 420$\,MeV and 250\,MeV. The quark field smearing scheme used in the distillation method strongly suppresses high-momentum states, thereby limiting the maximum accessible center-of-mass energy in this study to approximately 6.6\,GeV. Given the observed near-decoupling of the $\eta_c\eta_c$ and $J/\psi J/\psi$ channels, we analyze their scattering properties using the single-channel L\"{u}scher's method. In $0^{++}$ channels, $\eta_c\eta_c$ and $J/\psi J/\psi$ have repulsive and attractive interactions, respectively, which are dominated by the quark exchange effects with the Fierz rearrangement determining the interaction characteristic. A likely $0^{++}$ virtual state is observed below the threshold by 20-40\,MeV in the ${}^1S_0$ $J/\psi J/\psi$ scattering and may have connection with $X(6200)$. In $2^{++}$ channels, the near-threshold interaction for the ${}^5S_2$ $J/\psi J/\psi$ scattering is repulsive. The di-charmonium interactions are found to be insensitive to $m_\pi$ and can be consistently understood in terms of quark rearrangement effects combined with a one-gluon-exchange mechanism, both of which are supported by our lattice QCD results. Most importantly, we observe a $2^{++}$ resonance in the ${}^5S_2$ $J/\psi J/\psi$ scattering, whose properties are $(m_R,\Gamma_R)=\big(6544(10),552(34)\big)$\,MeV for $m_\pi\approx 420$\,MeV and $\big(6539(13),546(57)\big)$\,MeV for $m_\pi\approx 250$\,MeV, which are compatible with the parameters of the fully-charmed broad structure $X(6600)$ (or $X(6400)$) reported by ATLAS and CMS.</description>

      <title>The four-gluon and ghost-gluon vertices in the Landau gauge from lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of the four-gluon and ghost-gluon vertices in the Landau gauge using high statistical lattice ensembles for $32^4$ and $48^4$ volumes is addressed. For the four-gluon vertex, our previous results for the collinear kinematics are updated allowing to get a better coverage of the IR region. Furthermore, the one-particle irreducible ghost-gluon Green function in the soft gluon limit is computed covering, with precision, a large momentum region.</description>

      <title>Langer's nucleation rate reproduced on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Langer's rate of bubble nucleation is quantitatively correct up to small higher-loop corrections, in comparison to lattice simulations. These results are a significant advancement on decades of lattice studies showing only qualitative trends, and the first showing agreement for any conservative system. We confirm that the failure to fully thermalize the metastable phase explains discrepancies with recent lattice studies that found disagreement with Langer's rate. The key theoretical development is the translation of Langer's perturbative definition of a thermal metastable phase into a nonperturbative statement that can be implemented on the lattice. Our statistical and systematic errors are small enough to allow us to measure on the lattice the coefficient of the two-loop contribution, missing from the perturbative prediction. Our conclusions also exclude a possible systematic uncertainty in $^3$He experiments.</description>

      <title>Condensates, crystals, and renormalons in the Gross-Neveu model at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative QFT, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.</description>

      <title>Flow-based Nonperturbative Simulation of First-order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a flow-based method for simulating and calculating nucleation rates of first-order phase transitions in scalar field theory on a lattice. Motivated by recent advancements in machine learning tools, particularly normalizing flows for lattice field theory, we propose the ``partitioning flow-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (PFMCMC) sampling" method to address two challenges encountered in normalizing flow applications for lattice field theory: the ``mode-collapse" and ``rare-event sampling" problems. Using a (2+1)-dimensional real scalar model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our PFMCMC method in modeling highly hierarchical order parameter probability distributions and simulating critical bubble configurations. These simulations are then used to facilitate the calculation of nucleation rates. We anticipate the application of this method to (3+1)-dimensional theories for studying realistic cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Large $\theta$ angle in two-dimensional large $N$ $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In confining large $N$ theories with a $\theta$ angle such as four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory, there are multiple metastable vacua and it makes sense to consider the parameter region of ``large $\theta$ of order $N$'' despite the fact that $\theta$ is a $2\pi$-periodic parameter. We investigate this parameter region in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the partition function on $T^2$. When $\theta/N$ is of order $ \mathcal{O}(0.1) $ or less, we get perfectly sensible results for the vacuum energies and decay rates of metastable vacua. However, when $\theta/N$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(1) $, we encounter a problem about saddle points that would give larger contributions to the partition function than the true vacuum. We discuss why it might not be straightforward to resolve this problem.</description>

      <title>Flowing from the Ising Model on the Fuzzy Sphere to the 3D Lee-Yang CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.</description>
