      <title>X-ray measurements of gas distribution in a zero gap alkaline water electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray radioscopy was used to measure the 2D projected dynamic void fraction in a zero/narrow gap alkaline water electrolyzer at a spatial resolution of 15 $\mu$m, for narrow gap sizes up to 300 $\mu$m and current densities up to 0.54 A/cm$^2$. As expected, the void fraction in the bulk was found to increase along the cell height and with increasing current density. The void fraction measured in the gap region (the space between the diaphragm and the electrode and its holes) was always larger than in the bulk. It hardly depended on the gap size at current densities below 0.3 A/cm$^2$. The lowest cell potential was measured for zero gap. No evidence of isolating gas pockets/films in the gaps was found. Liquid crossover and oxygen void fraction exceeding the hydrogen void fraction occurred for porous plate electrodes, but these phenomena were suppressed for perforated foil electrodes.</description>

      <title>Performance Analyses of the Newly Developed Operational Amplifier aRD820</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational amplifiers are critical components in modern analog electronics, widely used across applications such as signal conditioning, instrumentation, voltage regulation, and analog-to-digital conversion. This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of the aRD820, a low-power, rail-to-rail operational amplifier, as a cost-effective alternative to the industry-standard AD820. The aRD820 is optimized for operation on a single supply voltage ranging from 5 to 30 V or a dual supply of +-2.5 V to +-15 V. Key design objectives included achieving low voltage noise (&lt; 4 uV peak-to-peak from 0.1 to 10 Hz), ultra-low input bias current (&lt; 15 pA), and a low offset voltage (&lt; 500 uV), making it suitable for high-sensitivity applications. In adapting the AD820 design, RD Alfa Microelectronics addressed specific production constraints by modifying key circuit elements to meet the specifics of available production facilities. The modified input stage reduced noise by incorporating source followers, enhancing the allowable input signal range. Adjustments to the second and output stages improved phase stability and gain characteristics. Extensive testing of the aRD820 in both wafer form and TO-5 packaged chips confirmed that the amplifier meets or exceeds planned specifications. Comparative results demonstrate that the aRD820 provides open-loop gain, offset voltage stability, and output saturation voltages comparable to those of the AD820. Noise measurements yielded values within the planned range, with an input noise density of approximately 13.5 - 18.1 nV/Sqrt(Hz), suitable for applications requiring precision signal processing. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the design modifications and test results, establishing the aRD820 as a viable alternative to existing op-amps in similar applications.</description>

      <title>Microlens-enhanced SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel concept to enhance the photo-detection efficiency (PDE) of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) has been applied and remarkable positive results can be reported. This concept uses arrays of microlenses to cover every second SiPM pixel in a checkerboard arrangement and aims to deflect the light from the dead region of the pixelised structure towards the active region in the center of the pixel. The PDE is improved up to 24%, external cross-talk is reduced by 40% compared to a flat epoxy layer, and single photon time resolution is improved. This detector development is conducted in the context of the next generation LHCb scintillating fibre tracker located in a high radiation environment with a total of 700'000 detector channels. The simulation and measurement results are in good agreement and will be discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Electrospray Propulsion Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry Diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and capability of a novel time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry electrospray propulsion diagnostic is presented to investigate secondary species emission from surface impingement of high-velocity, energetic molecular ion plumes. Designed on the basis of traditional Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) principles, this diagnostic provides information on the relative intensity and chemical composition of secondary species given electrospray operational parameters like incident angle, primary ion energy, and target surface composition. The system consists of an externally-wetted tungsten ion source operating with room temperature ionic liquid propellant, a target with a secondary species extraction mesh, and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer featuring an electrostatic deflection gate and a multichannel plate detector. Results show that energetic primary plume impacts with metallic surfaces induce molecular secondary ion emission in both positive and negative polarities. Likely sources of these secondary ions are considered - including hydrocarbon contamination of the target surface and charged fragments of the molecular primary ionic liquid ions. For electrospray propulsion, these secondary species contribute not only to lifetime limiting processes intrinsic to thruster operation like impingement and thus degradation of electrodes and emitters, but also contribute to facility effects corrupting ground-based testing and thruster flight qualification.</description>

      <title>FANSIC: a Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit for the readout of large silicon photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM) have been replacing traditional photomultiplier tubes in most light sensing applications. However, when large detection surface coverage is needed, photomultipliers (PMTs) are still the preferred choice. The main reasons are the sensor thermal noise and the duration of the fast component of its signal, both increasing with the sensor surface. In this work we propose an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), called Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit (FANSIC), for the readout of large SiPMs addressing these limitations. The ASIC has an active summation stage, which allows to divide a large detection surface into smaller ones offering faster response both in single ended and differential outputs. The high input bandwidth allows to reach full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) signals or the order of 3--5 ns which limits the impact of internal and external uncorrelated noise. The results of the first implementation of FANSIC, designed in CMOS 65 nm technology, is described in this paper.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Relaxation Oscillations in Superconducting Nanobridge Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate novel laser-induced relaxation oscillations in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). These oscillations appear when a voltage biased NbTiN nanobridge detector is illuminated with intense pulsed laser light at a repetition rate of ~19 MHz. They differ from the well-known relaxation oscillations by a step-wise increase in frequency and phase locking of the oscillations to the laser pulses. An electrical model that does not include thermal effects can be used to simulate the observed laser-induced relaxation oscillations. Good agreement to the experiment is achieved using realistic values for the parameters in the model.</description>

      <title>Likelihood and Deep Learning Analysis of the electron neutrino event sample at Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) is a next-generation long baseline neutrino experiment. One of its primary physics goals is to measure neutrino oscillation parameters precisely, including the Dirac CP violating phase. As conventional $\nu_{\mu}$ beam generates from the J-PARC neutrino baseline contains only 1.5$\%$ of $\nu_{e}$ interaction of total, it is challenging to measure $\nu_{e}/\bar{\nu}_{e}$ scattering cross-section on nuclei. To reduce these systematic uncertainties, IWCD will be built to study neutrino interaction rates with higher precision. Simulated data comprise $\nu_{e}CC0\pi$ as the main signal with NC$\pi^{0}$ and $\nu_{\mu}CC$ are major background events. To reduce the backgrounds initially, a log-likelihood-based reconstruction algorithm to select candidate events was used. However, this method sometimes struggles to distinguish $\pi^{0}$ events properly from electron-like events. Thus, a Machine Learning-based framework has been developed and implemented to enhance the purity and efficiency of $\nu_{e}$ events.</description>

      <title>An Improved Bound on Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics using a Cryogenic Radio Frequency Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are strong arguments that quantum mechanics may be nonlinear in its dynamics. A discovery of nonlinearity would hint at a novel understanding of the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory, for example. As such, experiments searching for potential nonlinear effects in the electromagnetic sector are important. Here we outline such an experiment, consisting of a stream of random bits (which were generated using Rigetti's Aspen-M-3 chip) as input to an RF signal generator coupled to a cryogenic detector. Projective measurements of the qubit state, which is originally prepared in an equal superposition, serve as the random binary output of a signal generator. Thereafter, spectral analysis of the RF detector would yield a detectable excess signal predicted to arise from such a nonlinear effect. A comparison between the projective measurements of the quantum bits vs the classical baseline showed no power excess. This sets a new limit on the electromagnetic nonlinearity parameter $|\epsilon| \lessapprox 1.15 \times 10^{-12}$, at a 90.0% confidence level. This is the most stringent limit on nonlinear quantum mechanics thus far and an improvement by nearly a factor of 50 over the previous experimental limit.</description>

      <title>The Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmon: A Qubit-Based Sensor for meV Scale Phonons and Single THz Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01345v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With great interest from the quantum computing community, an immense amount of R&amp;D effort has been invested into improving superconducting qubits. The technologies developed for the design and fabrication of these qubits can be directly applied to applications for ultra-low threshold particle detectors, e.g. low-mass dark matter and far-IR photon sensing. We propose a novel sensor based on the transmon qubit architecture combined with a signal-enhancing superconducting quasiparticle amplification stage. We refer to these sensors as SQUATs: Superconducting Quasiparticle-Amplifying Transmons. We detail the operating principle and design of this new sensor and predict that with minimal R&amp;D effort, solid-state based detectors patterned with these sensors can achieve sensitivity to single THz photons, and sensitivity to $1\,\mathrm{meV}$ phonons in the detector absorber substrate on the $\mu\mathrm{s}$ timescale.</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Topological Josephson parametric amplifier array: A proposal for directional, broadband, and low-noise amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13728v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-noise microwave amplifiers are crucial for detecting weak signals in fields such as quantum technology and radio astronomy. However, designing an ideal amplifier is challenging, as it must cover a wide frequency range, add minimal noise, and operate directionally - amplifying signals only in the observer's direction while protecting the source from environmental interference. In this work, we demonstrate that an array of non-linearly coupled Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) can collectively function as a directional, broadband quantum amplifier by harnessing topological effects. By applying a collective four-wave-mixing pump with inhomogeneous amplitudes and linearly increasing phase, we break time-reversal symmetry in the JPA array and stabilize a topological amplification regime where signals are exponentially amplified in one direction and exponentially suppressed in the opposite. We show that compact devices with few sites $N\sim 11-17$ can achieve exceptional performance, with gains exceeding 20 dB over a bandwidth ranging from hundreds of MHz to GHz, and reverse isolation suppressing backward noise by more than 30 dB across all frequencies. The device also operates near the quantum noise limit and provides topological protection against up to 15% fabrication disorder, effectively suppressing gain ripples. The amplifier's intrinsic directionality eliminates the need for external isolators, paving the way for fully on-chip, near-ideal superconducting pre-amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Skipper-in-CMOS: Non-Destructive Readout with Sub-Electron Noise Performance for Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Skipper-in-CMOS image sensor integrates the non-destructive readout capability of Skipper Charge Coupled Devices (Skipper-CCDs) with the high conversion gain of a pinned photodiode in a CMOS imaging process, while taking advantage of in-pixel signal processing. This allows both single photon counting as well as high frame rate readout through highly parallel processing. The first results obtained from a 15 x 15 um^2 pixel cell of a Skipper-in-CMOS sensor fabricated in Tower Semiconductor's commercial 180 nm CMOS Image Sensor process are presented. Measurements confirm the expected reduction of the readout noise with the number of samples down to deep sub-electron noise of 0.15rms e-, demonstrating the charge transfer operation from the pinned photodiode and the single photon counting operation when the sensor is exposed to light. The article also discusses new testing strategies employed for its operation and characterization.</description>

      <title>Integrating high-precision and fringe-scale displacement sensing using heterodyne cavity-tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a heterodyne stabilized cavity-based interferometer scheme that can serve as a compact and high-sensitivity displacement sensor with a fringe-scale operating range. The technique, in principle, can reach a sub-femtometer noise floor and an operating range on the order of one laser wavelength at $\lambda \approx 1\,\mu m$. With our current experimental setup, we achieve a sensitivity of about $130 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $1\,Hz$ and $23 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at around $130\,Hz$. By probing a length actuated cavity, we demonstrate six orders of magnitude of dynamic range for displacement measurement, reaching a maximum motion of $0.15\,\mu m$. The tracking bandwidth and displacement range are limited by analog effects in the signal digitization and are extendable in the future.</description>
