      <title>The Semiclasscical limit of $SU(3)$ Gauge Field Coherent States: Peakedness and Overlap Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the heat kernel method, we construct diffeomorphism-covariant coherent states for the $SU(3)$ gauge group. We numerically demonstrate that these states exhibit the required semiclassical properties in the semiclassical limit: the peakedness property of the probability distribution and the peakedness property of the overlap function. We also provide the leading order term of the overlap amplitude in the combined limit where $t \rightarrow 0$ and $g\rightarrow g'$. This work provides the essential tool for deriving effective dynamics for $SU(3)$ gauge fields coupled to gravity via a coherent state path integral.</description>

      <title>$CPT$-Symmetric K\"ahler-Dirac Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K\"ahler-Dirac (KD) spinors have generated excitement in the lattice gauge theory community, as a way to (i) deal with the ``fermion doubling" problems that plague ordinary (Dirac, Majorana, or Weyl) spinors when discretized on a lattice, and (ii) help explain the structure of the standard model. But if one naively quantizes this theory in Lorentzian signature, problems arise: half the KD fields have the ``wrong sign" Lagrangian, and give rise to negative norm states. Here we propose a new resolution/interpretation: the KD field actually lives on a two-sheeted spacetime, with the sheets related by $PT$ symmetry or, alternatively, by $i\leftrightarrow-i$. And, to avoid any unphysical interactions between the two sheets, the KD field obeys a reality condition (which we call the ``KD-Majorana condition"), which forces every particle on one sheet to be accompanied by a mirror (anti-)particle on the other sheet. We discuss how the standard model fits in this framework, how the fermion (kinetic and Yukawa) terms simplify, and how it may relate to the CPT-symmetric universe model.</description>

      <title>Window observables for benchmarking parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global analysis of collider and fixed-target experimental data and calculations from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are used to gain complementary information on the structure of hadrons. We propose novel ``window observables'' that allow for higher precision cross-validation between the different approaches, a critical step for studies that wish to combine the datasets. Global analyses are limited by the kinematic regions accessible to experiment, particularly in a range of Bjorken-$x$, and lattice QCD calculations also have limitations requiring extrapolations to obtain the parton distributions. We provide two different ``window observables'' that can be defined within a region of $x$ where extrapolations and interpolations in global analyses remain reliable and where lattice QCD results retain sensitivity and precision.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Higgs and deconfinement-Higgs transitions in four-dimensional SU(2) LGT at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-examine by numerical simulation the phase structure of the (3+1)-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with gauge fields coupled to Higgs fields at finite temperature. Concretely, we explore two different order parameters which are able to distinguish the three phases of the theory: (i) the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator used to discriminate between deconfinement and confinement/Higgs phases and (ii) the Greensite-Matsuyama overlap operator proposed recently to distinguish confinement and Higgs phases.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the $Nc^1$ scaling in the confined but chirally symmetric phase at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is lattice evidence that the QCD matter above the chiral restoration temperature Tch and below the deconfinement temperature Td, called stringy fluid, is characterized by an approximate chiral spin symmetry, which is a symmetry of confinement in QCD with light quarks. The energy density, pressure and entropy density in the stringy fluid scale as Nc^1, which is in contrast to the Nc^0 scaling in the hadron gas and to the Nc^2 scaling in the quark-gluon plasma. Here we clarify the origin of the Nc^1 scaling. We employ a solvable field-theoretical large $N_c$ chirally symmetric and confining model. In vacuum the confining potential induces a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The mesons are spatially localized states of quarks and antiquarks. Still in the confining regime the system undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition at $T_{ch}$ because of Paili blocking of the quark levels required for the existence of the quark condensate, by the thermal excitation of quarks and antiquarks. The same Paili blocking leads to a delocalization of the color singlet low-spin meson-like states that become infinitely large in the chiral limit. Consequently the stringy fluid represents a very dense medium of the overlapping huge color-singlet low-spin quark-antiquark systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation that determines the rest-frame excitation energies of the color-singlet quark-antiquark system is Nc-independent both in vacuum and in the medium in the confining regime. The excitation energy of the quark-antiquark color-singlet systems scales as Nc^0, i.e. as meson mass in vacuum. The Nc^1 scaling of the energy density in the stringy fluid is provided by the fluctuations of the color-singlet quark-antiquark systems.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Kramers-Wannier dualities in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged) fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW (self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hadronic tensor molecule $B_c^{\ast +}B_c^{\ast -}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass and full decay width of the hadronic tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{T}}=B_c^{\ast +}B_c^{\ast -}$ are examined in the framework of QCD sum rule method. To find the mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this state, we use the two-point sum rules. The result $(12.87 \pm 0.08)~\mathrm{ GeV}$ for $m$ indicates that $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ can easily decay to pairs of $J/\psi \Upsilon $, $\eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$, and $ B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ mesons. Kinematically permitted ways for $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ to transform to conventional mesons include also processes $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}} \to D^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )-}$, $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\ast)+}D_{s}^{(\ast)-}$ triggered by annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ quarks in the molecule. The decays to meson pairs $B^{(\ast)+}B^{(\ast )-}$, $B^{(\ast )0}\overline{B}^{(\ast )0}$ , and $B_{s}^{(\ast)0}\overline{B}_{s}^{(\ast )0}$ generated by $c\overline{c } \to $ light quarks are also among possible channels of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$. Technical tools of the three-point sum rule approach are applied to compute partial widths of these decays. Our results for the mass and width $\Gamma_{\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}}=(154 \pm 19)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ are important for experimental studies of fully heavy exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Masses of Purely Top-Quark Bound States: Toponium and the Triply-Top Baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudoscalar ($\eta_t$) and vector ($\psi_t$) toponium states, as well as the triply-top baryon ($\Omega_{ttt}$), using the QCD sum-rule method. This study was motivated by the recent observation of a pseudoscalar enhancement near the $t\bar{t}$ threshold, reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$. In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium align with the CMS prediction within the corresponding uncertainty range. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\bar{t}$ bound states. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.</description>
