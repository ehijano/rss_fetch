      <title>Spreading dynamics in the Hatano-Nelson model with disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is the accumulation of eigenstates at the boundaries, reflecting the system's nonreciprocity. Introducing disorder leads to a competition between the skin effect and Anderson localization, giving rise to the skin-Anderson transition. Here, we investigate wave packet spreading in the disordered Hatano-Nelson model and uncover distinct dynamical behaviors across different regimes. In the clean limit, transport is unidirectionally ballistic ({\Delta}x ~ t) due to nonreciprocity. For weak disorder, where skin and Anderson-localized modes coexist, transport transitions from ballistic at early times to superdiffusive ({\Delta}x ~ t^{2/3}) at long times. In the deeply Anderson-localized regime, initial diffusion ({\Delta}x ~ t^{1/2}) eventually gives way to superdiffusive spreading. We examine how these scaling behaviors emerge from the system's spectral properties and eigenstate localization behaviors. Our work unveils the rich dynamics driven by nonreciprocity and disorder in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond catastrophic forgetting in associative networks with self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-glass models of associative memories are a cornerstone between statistical physics and theoretical neuroscience. In these networks, stochastic spin-like units interact through a synaptic matrix shaped by local Hebbian learning. In absence of self-interactions (i.e., autapses), the free energy reveals catastrophic forgetting of all stored patterns when their number exceeds a critical memory load. Here, we bridge the gap with biology by considering networks of deterministic, graded units coupled via the same Amari-Hopfield synaptic matrix, while retaining autapses. Contrary to the assumption that self-couplings play a negligible role, we demonstrate that they qualitatively reshape the energy landscape, confining the recurrent dynamics to the subspace hosting the stored patterns. This allows for the derivation of an exact overlap-dependent Lyapunov function, valid even for networks with finite size. Moreover, self-interactions generate an auxiliary internal field aligned with the target memory pattern, widening the repertoire of accessible attractor states. Consequently, pure recall states act as robust associative memories for any memory load, beyond the critical threshold for catastrophic forgetting observed in spin-glass models -- all without requiring nonlocal learning prescriptions or significant reshaping of the Hebbian synaptic matrix.</description>

      <title>Nernst Sign-Reversal in the Hexatic Vortex Phase of Weakly Disordered a-MoGe Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hexatic phase is an intermediate stage in the melting process of a 2D crystal due to topological defects. Recently, this exotic phase was experimentally identified in the vortex lattice of 2D weakly disordered superconducting MoGe by scanning tunneling microscopic measurements. Here we study this vortex state by the Nernst effect, which is an effective and sensitive tool to detect vortex motion, especially in the superconducting fluctuation regime. We find a surprising Nernst sign reversal at the melting transition of the hexatic phase. We propose that they are a consequence of vortex dislocations in the hexatic state which diffuse preferably from the cold to hot.</description>

      <title>Ordering transition of the three-dimensional four-state random-field Potts model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin systems exposed to the influence of random magnetic fields are paradigmatic examples for studying the effect of quenched disorder on condensed-matter systems. In this context, previous studies have almost exclusively focused on systems with Ising or continuous symmetries, while the Potts symmetry, albeit being of fundamental importance also for the description of realistic physical systems, has received very little attention. In the present study, we use a recently developed quasi-exact method for determining ground states in the random-field Potts model to study the problem with four states. Extending the protocol applied for the three-state model, we use extensive finite-size scaling analyses of the magnetization, Binder parameter, energy cumulant, specific heat, and the connected as well as disconnected susceptibilities to study the magnetic ordering transition of the model. In contrast to the system in the absence of disorder, we find compelling evidence for a continuous transition, and we precisely determine the critical point as well as the critical exponents, which are found to differ from the exponents of the three-state system as well as from those of the random-field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Hard Spheres in the Fluid, Crystalline, and Glassy Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response of a system of hard spheres to two classes of perturbations over a range of densities spanning the fluid, crystalline, and glassy regimes within a molecular dynamics framework. Firstly, we consider the relaxation of a "thermal inhomogeneity," in which a central region of particles is given a higher temperature than its surroundings and is then allowed to evolve under Newtonian dynamics. In this case, the hot central "core" of particles expands and collides with the cold surrounding material, creating a transient radially-expanding "compression wave," which is rapidly dissipated by particle-particle collisions and interaction with periodic images at the boundary, leading to a rapid relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we consider a rapid compression of the spheres into a disordered glassy state at high densities. Such rapidly compressed systems exhibit very slow structural relaxation times, many orders of magnitude longer than thermalization times for simple temperature inhomogeneities. We find that thermal relaxation of the velocity distribution is determined simply by the total collision rate, whereas structural relaxation requires coordinated collective motion, which is strongly suppressed at high density, although some particle rearrangement nevertheless occurs. We further find that collisions propagate significantly faster through glassy systems than through crystalline systems at the same density, which leads to very rapid relaxation of velocity perturbations, although structural relaxation remains very slow. These results extend the validity of previous observations that glassy systems exhibit a hybrid character, sharing features with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we introduce the hard sphere causal graph, a network-based characterization of the dynamical history of a hard sphere system, which encapsulates several useful...</description>

Abstract: We prove constant degree polynomial algorithms cannot optimize pure spherical $p$-spin Hamiltonians beyond the algorithmic threshold $\mathsf{ALG}(p)=2\sqrt{\frac{p-1}{p}}$. The proof goes by transforming any hypothetical such algorithm into a Lipschitz one, for which hardness was shown previously by the author and B. Huang.</description>

      <title>Fine tuning generative adversarial networks with universal force fields: application to two-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid growth in use cases for generative artificial intelligence, its ability to design purpose built crystalline materials remains in a nascent phase. At the moment inverse design is generally accomplished by either constraining the training data set or producing a vast number of samples from a generator network and constraining the output via post-processing. We show that a general adversarial network trained to produce crystal structures from a latent space can be fine tuned through the introduction of advanced graph neural networks as discriminators, including a universal force field, to intrinsically bias the network towards generation of target materials. This is exemplified utilizing two-dimensional topological insulators as a sample target space. While a number of two-dimensional topological insulators have been predicted, the size of the band-gap, a measure of topological protection, remains a concern in most candidate compounds. The resulting generative network is shown to yield novel topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Energy Gap Modulation in Proximitized Superconducting Puddles of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated proximity-induced superconductivity in a graphene-insulating InO bilayer system through gate-controlled transport measurements. Distinct oscillations in the differential conductance are observed across both the electron and hole doping regimes, with oscillation amplitudes increasing as the chemical potential moves away from the Dirac point. These findings are explained using a theoretical model of a normal-superconductor-normal (NSN) junction, which addresses reflection and transmission probabilities at normal incidence. From this model, we extract key parameters for the proximitized graphene, including the superconducting energy gap Delta and the effective length scale Ls of the superconducting regions. Near the Dirac point, we observe a minimal Ls and a maximal Delta, aligning with the theory that the gap in strongly disordered superconductors increases as the coherence length of localized pairs decreases. This suggests that spatial confinement in a low-density superconductor leads to an effective increase in the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Inertia-induced scaling and criticality in martensites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales. However, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self organization towards criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of the fluctuations spectrum can be interpreted as an effect of inertia. The general insight is that inertial dynamics can become a crucial player when the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced criticality using an elementary example of mass points connected by bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in the fully realistic two and three dimensional continuum models of specific elastic phase transitions in crystals.</description>

      <title>The simplest spin glass revisited: finite-size effects of the energy landscape can modify aging dynamics in the thermodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random energy model is one of the few glass models whose asymptotic activated aging dynamics are solvable. However, the existing aging theory, i.e., Bouchaud's trap model, does not agree with dynamical simulation results obtained in finite-sized systems. Here we show that this discrepancy originates from non-negligible finite-size corrections in the energy barrier distributions. The finite-size effects add a logarithmic decay term in the time-correlation aging function, which destroys the asymptotic large-time plateau predicted by Bouchaud's trap model in the spin glass phase. Surprisingly, the finite-size effects also give corrections, preserved even in the thermodynamic limit, to the value of the asymptotic plateau. It results in an unexpected dynamical transition where weak ergodicity breaking occurs, at a temperature $T_{\rm d}$ above the thermodynamic spin-glass transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$. Based on the barrier distributions obtained by a numerical barrier-tree method and an expansion theory, we propose a generalized trap model to incorporate such finite-size effects. The theoretically derived aging behavior of the generalized trap model explains the Monte-Carlo dynamical simulation data of random energy models with Gaussian and exponential random energies. Our results suggest that the double limits of large system size and long time are not interchangeable for the activated aging dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anderson localization (AL) and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are, respectively, driven by disorder and non-reciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian (NH) version of the celebrated Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate localization-delocalization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between AL and NHSE can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate quantum jumps between the NH-induced skin states and the AL states to occur in the system. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The localization properties of our model can be studied by analyzing the voltage profile (VP) of the circuit. The VP exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the NHSE, while the phenomenon of AL can be perceived via the localization of the VP in the vicinity of the excitation node where the power supply is connected. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the VP. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the NH AA model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits that should open avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic devices, such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient information transfer systems.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</description>

      <title>Correlated decoding of logical algorithms with transversal gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is believed to be essential for scalable quantum computation, but its implementation is challenging due to its considerable space-time overhead. Motivated by recent experiments demonstrating efficient manipulation of logical qubits using transversal gates (Bluvstein et al., Nature 626, 58-65 (2024)), we show that the performance of logical algorithms can be substantially improved by decoding the qubits jointly to account for error propagation during transversal entangling gates. We find that such correlated decoding improves the performance of both Clifford and non-Clifford transversal entangling gates, and explore two decoders offering different computational runtimes and accuracies. In particular, by leveraging the deterministic propagation of stabilizer measurement errors through transversal Clifford gates, we find that correlated decoding enables the number of noisy syndrome extraction rounds between these gates to be reduced from $O(d)$ to $O(1)$ in Clifford circuits, where $d$ is the code distance. We verify numerically that this approach substantially reduces the space-time cost of deep logical Clifford circuits. These results demonstrate that correlated decoding provides a major advantage in early fault-tolerant computation, as realized in recent experiments, and further indicate it has considerable potential to reduce the space-time cost in large-scale logical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</description>

      <title>A Model for Topological p-wave Superconducting Wires with Disorder and Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>Exploring entanglement in finite-size quantum systems with degenerate ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach for characterizing non-local quantum correlations in spin systems with exactly or nearly degenerate ground states. Starting with linearly independent degenerate eigenfunctions calculated with exact diagonalization we generate a finite set of their random linear combinations with Haar measure, which guarantees that these combinations are uniformly distributed in the space spanned by the initial eigenstates. Estimating the von Neumann entropy of the random wave functions helps to reveal previously unknown features of the quantum correlations in the phases with degeneracy of the ground state. For instance, spin spiral phase of the quantum magnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is characterized by the enhancement of the entanglement entropy, which can be qualitatively explained by the changes in behaviour of two- and three-spin correlation functions. To establish the connection between our theoretical findings and real experiments we elaborate on the problem of estimating observables on the basis of the single-shot measurements of numerous degenerate eigenstates. By the example of solving a simple Ising model it is shown that digital quantum simulations performed with quantum computers can provide accurate description of the entanglement of the degenerate systems even in the presence of noise. We also discuss the ground state properties of degenerate fermionic and bosonic models, which can be useful for theoretical analysis of the experiments with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Robustness and Fragility of Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers) when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms can surpass state-of-the-art quantum annealers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05867-2" target="_blank"&gt;[King et al., Nature (2023)]&lt;/a&gt; in solving certain hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT), both applied to 3D spin glasses. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, while parallelizing fewer replicas across independent runs also achieves comparable scaling. Both strategies align with the theoretical expectations from extreme value theory. In addition, APT outperforms DT-SQA when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves. Finite-size scaling analysis suggests a universal behavior that explains the superior performance of APT over both DT-SQA and quantum annealing. We show that these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware thanks to the mature semiconductor technology. Unlike software simulations, replicas can be monolithically housed on a single chip and a large number of spins can be updated in parallel and asynchronously, similar to a quantum annealer. We project that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips leveraging massive parallelism can further accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude, while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results raise the bar for a practical quantum advantage in optimization and present p-computers as scalable, energy-efficient hardware for real-world optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>
