      <title>$L^p$-estimates for FIO-cone multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical cone multipliers are Fourier multiplier operators which localize to narrow $1/R$-neighborhoods of the truncated light cone in frequency space. By composing such convolution operators with suitable translation invariant Fourier integral operators (FIOs), we obtain what we call FIO-cone multipliers. We introduce and study classes of such FIO-cone multipliers on $\Bbb R^3$, in which the phase functions of the corresponding FIOs are adapted in a natural way to the geometry of the cone and may even admit singularities at the light cone.
  By building on methods developed by Guth, Wang and Zhang in their proof of the cone multiplier conjecture in $\Bbb R^3,$ we obtain $L^p$-estimates for FIO-cone multipliers in the range $4/3\le p\le 4$ which are stronger by the factor $R^{-|1/p-1/2|}$ than what a direct application of the method of Seeger, Sogge and Stein for estimating FIOs would give.
  An important application of our theory is to maximal averages along smooth analytic surfaces in $\Bbb R^3.$ It allows to confirm a conjecture on the the critical Lebesgue exponent for a prototypical surface from a small class of ``exceptional'' surfaces, for which this conjecture had remained open.</description>

      <title>An application of Brouwer's fixed-point theorem: continuously differentiable convex functions with gradient of constant norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an application of Brouwer's fixed-point theorem we prove that a continuously differentiable convex function with gradient of constant norm is an affine mapping. It is a first-order characterization of affine mappings among continuously differentiable convex functions, because neither the second-order condition of convexity nor related operators are used. The condition of differentiability is essential as the case of the norm function shows. In addition to Brouwer's theorem, the proof is based on the Cauchy--Bunyakovsky--Schwarz inequality and becomes complete by minimizing the distance between lines of gradient directions.
  Following the steps of the proof, we sketch a possible generalization of the result to functions defined on Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>H\"older- and Minkowski-type inequalities for generalized quasi-arithmetic means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish several necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure the validity of a general functional inequality in terms of generalized quasi-arithmetic means. In particular cases, we consider H\"older-, Minkowski-, and Jensen-type inequalities. Generalized quasi-arithmetic means are defined by taking strictly monotone generating functions instead of strictly monotone and continuous ones.</description>

      <title>From Brunn-Minkowski to Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb: discrete inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general way to obtain Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequalities from Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities and provide numerous examples. We use the same heuristic to prove a discrete version of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities for functions over $\mathbb{Z}^d$. These are the functional extensions of the discrete Brunn-Minkowski inequality conjectured by Ruzsa and recently established by Keevash, Tiba, and the author.</description>

      <title>$ABC$ sum-product theorems for Katz-Tao sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I prove two variants of the $ABC$ sum-product theorem for $\delta$-separated sets $A,B,C \subset [0,1]$ satisfying Katz-Tao spacing conditions. The main novelty is that the cardinality of the sets $B,C$ need not match their non-concentration exponent. The new $ABC$ theorems are sharp under their respective hypotheses, and imply the previous one.</description>

      <title>A $3\times 3$ singular solution to the Matrix Bochner Problem with $\mathcal{D}(W)$ not of the form $\mathbb{C}[D]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Matrix Bochner Problem aims to classify weight matrices whose sequences of orthogonal polynomials are eigenfunctions of a second-order differential operator. A major breakthrough in this direction was achieved in [7], where it was shown that, under certain natural conditions on the algebra $\mathcal{D}(W)$, all solutions arise from Darboux transformations of direct sums of classical scalar weights. In this paper, we study a new $3 \times 3$ Hermite-type weight matrix and determine its algebra $\mathcal{D}(W)$ as a $\mathbb{C}[D_1]$-module generated by $\{I, D_2\}$, where $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are second-order differential operators. This complete description of the algebra allows us to prove that the weight does not arise from a Darboux transformation of classical scalar weights, showing that it falls outside the classification theorem of [7]. Unlike previous examples in [3,4], which also do not fit within this classification, the algebra $\mathcal{D}(W)$ of this weight matrix is not generated by a single differential operator $D$, making it a fundamentally different case. These results complement the classification theorem of the Matrix Bochner Problem by providing a new type of singular example.</description>
