      <title>Phase space path integral representation of the dynamic structure factor. Monte Carlo simulation of strongly correlated soft-sphere fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic structure factor (DSF) is a mathematical function that contains information about inter-particle correlations and their time evolution. Mostly the classical molecular dynamics is used to calculate the DSF of the classical systems. On the contrary this article deals with quantum systems and the quantum dynamic structure factor. The Wigner formulation of quantum mechanics was used to derive the path integral representation of the DSF, which is based on the Wiener-Khinchin theorem showing relation of the the power spectrum of a random paths to their correlation function. The $3 {\rm D} $ quantum system of strongly correlated soft-sphere fermions was considered as an interesting physical example.
  The developed Wigner path integral Monte Carlo (WPIMC) approach has been developed to calculate the spin--resolved DSFs, the radial distribution functions (RDFs) and other thermodynamic functions in a wide range of density and temperatures. The physical meaning of the peaks arising on the RDFs and DSF have been analyzed and explained by the manifestation of the interference effects of the exchange and interparticle interactions and, as well as, the wave interference between multiple-scattering. This phenomenon in the system of the soft-sphere scatterers may to be the precursor effect of the Anderson localization, which finds its origin in the wave interference between multiple-scattering paths.</description>

      <title>Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E&gt;E_0, while for E&lt;E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.</description>

      <title>The integer quantum Hall transition: an $S$-matrix approach to random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new $S$-matrix approach to numerical simulations of network models and apply it to random networks that we proposed in a previous work 10.1103/PhysRevB.95.125414. Random networks are modifications of the Chalker-Coddington (CC) model for the integer quantum Hall transition that more faithfully capture the physics of electrons moving in a strong magnetic field and a smooth disorder potential. The new method has considerable advantages compared to the transfer matrix approach, and gives the value $\nu \approx 2.4$ for the critical exponent of the localization length in a random network. This finding confirms our previous result and is surprisingly close to the experimental value $\nu_{\text{exp}} \approx 2.38$ observed at the integer quantum Hall transition but substantially different from the CC value $\nu_\text{CC} \approx 2.6$.</description>

      <title>Prototype Analysis in Hopfield Networks with Hebbian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss prototype formation in the Hopfield network. Typically, Hebbian learning with highly correlated states leads to degraded memory performance. We show this type of learning can lead to prototype formation, where unlearned states emerge as representatives of large correlated subsets of states, alleviating capacity woes. This process has similarities to prototype learning in human cognition. We provide a substantial literature review of prototype learning in associative memories, covering contributions from psychology, statistical physics, and computer science. We analyze prototype formation from a theoretical perspective and derive a stability condition for these states based on the number of examples of the prototype presented for learning, the noise in those examples, and the number of non-example states presented. The stability condition is used to construct a probability of stability for a prototype state as the factors of stability change. We also note similarities to traditional network analysis, allowing us to find a prototype capacity. We corroborate these expectations of prototype formation with experiments using a simple Hopfield network with standard Hebbian learning. We extend our experiments to a Hopfield network trained on data with multiple prototypes and find the network is capable of stabilizing multiple prototypes concurrently. We measure the basins of attraction of the multiple prototype states, finding attractor strength grows with the number of examples and the agreement of examples. We link the stability and dominance of prototype states to the energy profile of these states, particularly when comparing the profile shape to target states or other spurious states.</description>

      <title>Optimal thresholds and algorithms for a model of multi-modal learning in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores multi-modal inference in a high-dimensional simplified model, analytically quantifying the performance gain of multi-modal inference over that of analyzing modalities in isolation. We present the Bayes-optimal performance and weak recovery thresholds in a model where the objective is to recover the latent structures from two noisy data matrices with correlated spikes. The paper derives the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for this model and characterizes its performance in the high-dimensional limit via the associated state evolution. The analysis holds for a broad range of priors and noise channels, which can differ across modalities. The linearization of AMP is compared numerically to the widely used partial least squares (PLS) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods, which are both observed to suffer from a sub-optimal recovery threshold.</description>

      <title>Frustrations on Decorated Square Lattice in Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we performed the comprehensive studies of frustration properties in the Ising model on a decorated square lattice in the framework of an exact analytical approach based on the Kramers--Wannier transfer matrix method. The assigned challenge consisted in finding rigorous formulas for residual entropies of all possible frustrations without exception and elucidating the influence of frustrations on the behavior of the thermodynamic functions of the system under discussion. The accomplished results turned out to be very rich and intricate, especially in comparison with the original undecorated square lattice, in which frustration properties are completely absent. Such an abundance of properties is due to the multiparametric problem of decorated lattice with four exchange interactions $J_{x}$, $J_{y}$, $J_{dx}$ and $J_{dy}$ taking on arbitrary continuous values and different signs: positive (ferromagnetic) and negative (antiferromagnetic), as well as with two discrete variables $d_{x}$ and $d_{y}$ (multiplicities of decorating spins in both lattice directions), corresponding to infinite natural series of numbers.</description>

      <title>Predictive Coding Networks and Inference Learning: Tutorial and Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing call for renewed emphasis on neuroscience-inspired approaches in artificial intelligence research, under the banner of $\textit{NeuroAI}$. This is exemplified by recent attention gained by predictive coding networks (PCNs) within machine learning (ML). PCNs are based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding (PC), which views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors from feedback connections. PCNs trained with inference learning (IL) have potential advantages to traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs) trained with backpropagation. While historically more computationally intensive, recent improvements in IL have shown that it can be more efficient than backpropagation with sufficient parallelization, making PCNs promising alternatives for large-scale applications and neuromorphic hardware. Moreover, PCNs can be mathematically considered as a superset of traditional FNNs, which substantially extends the range of possible architectures for both supervised and unsupervised learning. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review as well as a formal specification of PCNs, in particular placing them in the context of modern ML methods, and positioning PC as a versatile and promising framework worthy of further study by the ML community.</description>

      <title>General theory for extended-range percolation on simple and multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended-range percolation is a robust percolation process that has relevance for quantum communication problems. In extended-range percolation nodes can be trusted or untrusted. Untrusted facilitator nodes are untrusted nodes that can still allow communication between trusted nodes if they lie on a path of distance at most R between two trusted nodes. In extended-range percolation the extended-range giant component (ERGC) includes trusted nodes connected by paths of trusted and untrusted facilitator nodes. Here, based on a message passing algorithm, we develop a general theory of extended-range percolation, valid for arbitrary values of R as long as the networks are locally tree-like. This general framework allows us to investigate the properties of extended-range percolation on interdependent multiplex networks. While the extended-range nature makes multiplex networks more robust, interdependency makes them more fragile. From the interplay between these two effects a rich phase diagram merges including discontinuous phase transitions and reentrant phases. The theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed exactly solvable model constitutes a fundamental reference for the study of models defined through properties of extended-range paths.</description>

      <title>Gapped Low Energy Excitations Across an Entanglement Percolation Transition in the Quantum Spin Liquid Candidate NaYbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum magnetism in frustrated triangular lattices has promised the discovery of exotic excitations emerging from many-body entanglement, like the quantum spin liquid. This field is vexed by the interplay of disorder, correlations and long-range order, whose properties are challenging to control and disentangle. We study the entropy-carrying excitations of a leading candidate in this search, the material NaYbSe$_2$, as a function of site dilution to directly address this challenge. We map the evolution of the entangled spins across the percolation transition, showing unequivocal evidence for the presence of an energy gap in the excitations of the system. However, we also show that this gap onsets at the percolation transition where disorder is the greatest, strongly suggesting that it is unlikely be associated with a quantum spin liquid. Instead we suggest the more universal scenario of a short-range ordered state with entropy-carrying boundaries.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization and slow dynamics in quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of a quasiperiodically driven electric field in a one-dimensional disordered fermionic chain. In the clean non-interacting case, we show the emergence of dynamical localization - a phenomenon previously known to exist only for a perfect periodic drive. In contrast, in the presence of disorder, where a periodic drive preserves Anderson localization, we show that the quasiperiodic drive destroys it and leads to slow relaxation. Considering the role of interactions, we uncover the phenomenon of quasiperiodic driving-induced logarithmic relaxation, where a suitably tuned drive (corresponding to dynamical localization in the clean, non-interacting limit) slows down the dynamics even when the disorder is small enough for the system to be in the ergodic phase. This is in sharp contrast to the fast relaxation seen in the undriven model, as well as the absence of thermalization (drive-induced MBL) exhibited by a periodically driven model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of Parisi's broken replica symmetry theory of spin glasses is the existence of a phase transition in an applied field to a state with broken replica symmetry. This transition takes place at the de Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in the $h-T$ plane. We have studied this line in the power-law diluted Heisenberg spin glass in which the probability that two spins separated by a distance $r$ interact with each other falls as $1/r^{2\sigma}$. In the presence of a random vector-field of variance $h_r^2$ the phase transition is in the universality class of the Ising spin glass in a field. Tuning $\sigma$ is equivalent to changing the dimension $d$ of the short-range system, with the relation being $d =2/(2\sigma -1)$ for $\sigma &lt; 2/3$. We have found by numerical simulations that $h_{\text{AT}}^2 \sim (2/3 -\sigma)$ implying that the AT line does not exist below $6$ dimensions and that the Parisi scheme is not appropriate for spin glasses in three dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we introduce simple structures for the analysis of complex hypergraphs, hypergraph animals. These structures are designed to describe the local node neighbourhoods of nodes in hypergraphs. We establish their relationships to lattice animals and network motifs, and we develop their combinatorial properties for sparse and uncorrelated hypergraphs. We make use of the tight link of hypergraph animals to partition numbers, which opens up a vast mathematical framework for the analysis of hypergraph animals. We then study their abundances in random hypergraphs. Two transferable insights result from this analysis: (i) it establishes the importance of high-cardinality edges in ensembles of random hypergraphs that are inspired by the classical Erd\"os-Reny\'i random graphs; and (ii) there is a close connection between degree and hyperedge cardinality in random hypergraphs that shapes animal abundances and spectra profoundly. Both findings imply that hypergraph animals can have the potential to affect information flow and processing in complex systems. Our analysis of also suggests that we need to spend more effort on investigating and developing suitable conditional ensembles of random hypergraphs that can capture real-world structures and their complex dependency structures.</description>

      <title>Symmetry's Edge in Cortical Dynamics: Multiscale Dynamics of Ensemble Excitation and Inhibition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating a quantitative theory for the cortex poses several challenges and raises numerous questions. For instance, what are the significant scales of the system? Are they micro, meso or macroscopic? What are the relevant interactions? Are they pairwise, higher order or mean-field? And what are the control parameters? Are they noisy, dissipative or emergent?
  To tackle these issues, we suggest using an approach akin to what has transformed our understanding of the state of matter. This includes identifying invariances in the ensemble dynamics of various neuron functional classes, searching for order parameters that connect important degrees of freedom and distinguish macroscopic system states, and identifying broken symmetries in the order parameter space to comprehend the emerging laws when many neurons interact and coordinate their activation.
  By utilizing multielectrode and multiscale neural recordings, we measure the scale-invariant balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons at a population level, referred to as ensemble E/I balance. This differs from the input E/I balance typically studied at the single-neuron level, focusing instead on the collective behavior of large neural populations. We investigate a set of parameters that can assist us in differentiating between various functional system states (such as the wake/sleep cycle) and pinpointing broken symmetries that serve different information processing and memory functions. Furthermore, we identify broken symmetries that result in pathological states like seizures.
  This study provides new insights into the multiscale dynamics of excitation and inhibition in cortical networks, advancing our understanding of the underlying principles governing neural computation and dysfunction.</description>

      <title>What can we learn from quantum convolutional neural networks?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We can learn from analyzing quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) that: 1) working with quantum data can be perceived as embedding physical system parameters through a hidden feature map; 2) their high performance for quantum phase recognition can be attributed to generation of a very suitable basis set during the ground state embedding, where quantum criticality of spin models leads to basis functions with rapidly changing features; 3) pooling layers of QCNNs are responsible for picking those basis functions that can contribute to forming a high-performing decision boundary, and the learning process corresponds to adapting the measurement such that few-qubit operators are mapped to full-register observables; 4) generalization of QCNN models strongly depends on the embedding type, and that rotation-based feature maps with the Fourier basis require careful feature engineering; 5) accuracy and generalization of QCNNs with readout based on a limited number of shots favor the ground state embeddings and associated physics-informed models. We demonstrate these points in simulation, where our results shed light on classification for physical processes, relevant for applications in sensing. Finally, we show that QCNNs with properly chosen ground state embeddings can be used for fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good generalization and proven trainability.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>

Abstract: The glassy dynamics of dense active matter have recently become a topic of interest due to their importance in biological processes such as wound healing and tissue development. However, while the liquid-state properties of dense active matter have been studied in relation to the glass transition of active matter, the solid-state properties of active glasses have yet to be understood. In this work, we study the structural fluctuations in the active glasses composed of self-propelled particles. We develop a formalism to describe the solid-state properties of active glasses in the harmonic approximation limit and use it to analyze the displacement fields in the active glasses. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of high-frequency normal modes become quasi-static with respect to the active forces, and consequently, excitations of these modes are significantly suppressed. This leads to a violation of the equipartition law, suppression of particle displacements, and the apparent collective motion of active glasses. Overall, our results provide a fundamental understanding of the solid-state properties of active glasses.</description>

      <title>Super-diffusive transport in two-dimensional Fermionic wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a two-dimensional model of a Fermionic wire which shows a power-law conductance behavior despite the presence of uncorrelated disorder along the direction of the transport. The power-law behavior is attributed to the presence of energy eigenstates of diverging localization length below some energy cutoff, $E_c$. To study transport, we place the wire in contact with electron reservoirs biased around a Fermi level, $E$. We show that the conductance scales super-diffusively for $|E|&lt;E_c$ and decays exponentially for $|E|&gt;E_c$. At $|E|=E_c$, we show that the conductance scales diffusively or with different sub-diffusive power-laws depending on the sign of the expectation value of the disorder and the parameters of the wire.</description>
