      <title>Versatile Reservoir Computing for Heterogeneous Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new machine learning scheme, termed versatile reservoir computing, is proposed for sustaining the dynamics of heterogeneous complex networks. We show that a single, small-scale reservoir computer trained on time series from a subset of elements is able to replicate the dynamics of any element in a large-scale complex network, though the elements are of different intrinsic parameters and connectivities. Furthermore, by substituting failed elements with the trained machine, we demonstrate that the collective dynamics of the network can be preserved accurately over a finite time horizon. The capability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are validated on three representative network models: a homogeneous complex network of non-identical phase oscillators, a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical phase oscillators, and a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical chaotic oscillators.</description>

      <title>A Note on Spinning Billiards and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of internal degrees of freedom - specifically spin - on the classical dynamics of billiard systems. While traditional studies model billiards as point particles undergoing specular reflection, we extend the paradigm by incorporating finite-size effects and angular momentum, introducing a dimensionless spin parameter $\alpha$ that characterizes the moment of inertia. Using numerical simulations across circular, rectangular, stadium, and Sinai geometries, we analyze the resulting trajectories and quantify chaos via the leading Lyapunov exponent. Strikingly, we find that spin regularizes the dynamics even in geometries that are classically chaotic: for a wide range of $\alpha$, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes at late times in the stadium and Sinai tables, signaling suppression of chaos. This effect is corroborated by phase space analysis showing non-exponential divergence of nearby trajectories. Our results suggest that internal structure can qualitatively alter the dynamical landscape of a system, potentially serving as a mechanism for chaos suppression in broader contexts.</description>

      <title>Composing $\alpha$-Gauss and logistic maps: Gradual and sudden transitions to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters, $r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system exhibits a gradual period-doubling route to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased, interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast, for $1 \leq \alpha &lt; 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio $\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal amplification toward chaos in a chain of Duffing oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A chain of harmonic oscillators with nonreciprocal coupling exhibits characteristic amplification behavior that serves as a classical analog of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). We extend this concept of nonreciprocal amplification to nonlinear dynamics by employing double-well Duffing oscillators arranged in ring-structured units. The addition of units induces bifurcations of attractors, driving transitions from limit cycles to tori, chaos, and hyper-chaos. Unidirectional couplings between units enable the decomposition of attractors in phase space into projected subspaces corresponding to each unit. In the chaotic regime, amplitude saturation emerges, characterized by monotonically decreasing amplitudes within a unit -- in sharp contrast to} the increasing profiles seen in the linear NHSE. This work uncovers novel bifurcation behavior resulting from the intricate interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Why is distortion inevitable in opinion propagation on social media? Noise induced layer-wised synchronization in Noise-Frustrated Hegselmann-Krause model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of social media as a dominant information propagation platform has intensified scholarly concerns about systemic information distortion,a phenomenon where content undergoes progressive alteration during multi layered transmission. However, existing literature extensively documents distortion patterns, the fundamental mechanisms coupling network architecture with cognitive noise remain poorly quantified. Here, we introduce a novel fractal network with coupled Noise Frustrated Hegselmann Krause (NFHK) framework that systematically disentangles these intertwined factors. By integrating fractal topology analysis with modified bounded confidence dynamics, our model reveals how hierarchical network structures (characterized by scale invariant connectivity patterns) amplify stochastic noise through successive retransmission layers. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, multi agent simulations, and empirical validation of typical retweet cascades, we demonstrate two key phenomena: (i) distortion escalates super linearly with network depth and (ii) peer nodes exhibit emergent layer wise synchronization despite lacking direct connections among themselves and form a number of synchronous groups based on the number of network layers. These findings establish a unified mechanism explaining distortion accumulation in digital ecosystems while challenging conventional "echo chamber" narratives. Our noise frustration protocol can offer actionable insights for policymakers to design topology aware regulatory frameworks. This work bridges complex systems theory with computational social science, providing both a mathematical foundation for distortion analysis and a toolkit for platform governance.</description>
