      <title>Empirical Modeling of Zodiacal Backgrounds to Improve JWST NIRISS/SOSS Data Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zodiacal light -- arising from both the thermal emission and scattered sunlight by interplanetary dust -- is the dominant component of the sky background in NIRISS Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) observations. The GR700XD grism disperses the zodiacal background across multiple diffraction orders, producing a characteristic two-dimensional, spectral order-dependent background pattern on the detector that reflects the combined contribution of overlapping orders. Observations reveal significant variability in background intensity driven by JWST's sky pointing and seasonal changes, underscoring the need for precise background subtraction during SOSS data reduction. Current methods rely on a generic background template derived during commissioning, scaled to match individual exposures. However, mis-scaled templates can leave behind structured residuals that may compromise the precision of exoplanet transit depth measurements. To improve background modeling, we conducted two calibration programs (PID 4479 and 6658) using the FULL frame readout mode and a 5-row by 2-column mosaic pattern to sample a range of sky positions. These observations enable empirical reconstruction of the sky background and provide detailed insights into its spatial and spectral characteristics. We present a library of empirically derived background templates and evaluate their performance, alongside the current template, by benchmarking against the PID 2113 dataset, which includes contemporaneous background exposures. This work supports aims to enhance background subtraction for SOSS time-series to achieve higher-precision exoplanet spectroscopy with JWST.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Improved Contrast on the Roman Coronagraph with Spatial Linear Dark Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baseline contrast floor from the Roman Coronagraph's High-Order Wavefront Sensing and Control strategy likely degrades over the course of time, requiring periodic recalibration of the dark hole. Here, we propose to consider spatial linear dark field control (sLDFC) on a one-sided deep-contrast region of the focal plane as a potential test. Implementing sLDFC on CGI will likely require some unique data acquisition strategies given the EMCCD's high flux sensitivity in long exposures/high gain: we outline three possible approaches. However, if successful, sLDFC's advances are substantial: (1) enabling us to maintain a fainter, more temporally correlated dark hole which will improve CGI's contrast after post-processing and (2) efficiently providing a reliable signal (bright field) for accurate reconstruction of residual starlight in the dark field, further boosting CGI's detection limit for bright targets.</description>

      <title>MESAlab: a Pipeline for Mapping the Blue Loop with MESA runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA; (Paxton2011, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019, Jermyn 2023) is a widely used open-source software for modelling stellar evolution. In many studies, the computational grids covers thousands of models (e.g., Joyce et al 2024), which requires a tremendous amount of time and computational effort to process.
  To streamline data analysis, the mesalab package was developed. This Python-based pipeline is designed to simplify the post-processing of MESA outputs by automatically identifying various stellar evolutionary phases, with a specific focus on the ``blue loop'' -- a blue-ward excursion in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) for intermediate-mass stars often associated with peculiar pulsational phenomena like ``strange modes.''</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the depth of the shower maximum of air showers with the SD-750 surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics. In order to identify their sources, we need precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs interacting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with different spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest sub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that, after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Controlled Beam Pattern Measurement Method Using a Power-Variable Calibration Source for Cosmic Microwave Background Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel beam pattern measurement method for the side lobe characterization of cosmic microwave background telescopes. The method employs a power-variable artificial microwave source under feedback control from the detector under test on the telescope. It enables us to extend the dynamic range of the beam pattern measurement without introducing nonlinearity effects from the detector. We conducted a laboratory-based proof-of-concept experiment, measuring the H-plane beam pattern of a horn antenna coupled to a diode detector at 81 GHz. We achieved a dynamic range of 77.7 dB in the beam pattern measurement, with 60.3 dB attributed to the feedback control. In addition, we verified the measurement by comparing it with other reference measurements obtained using conventional methods. The method is also applicable to general optical measurements requiring a high dynamic range to detect subtle nonidealities in the characteristics of optical devices.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based prediction of Precipitable Water Vapor in the Chajnantor area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths heavily depend on the amount of Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere, directly affecting the sky transparency and degrading the quality of the signals received by radio telescopes. Predictions of PWV at different forecasting horizons is crucial to support telescope operations, engineering planning, and observational scheduling and efficiency of radio observatories installed in the Chajnantor area in northern Chile. We developed and validated a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning-based model to predict PWV at forecasting horizons of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours using historical data from two 183 GHz radiometers and a weather station in the Chajnantor area. We find the LSTM method is able to predict PWV in the 12 and 24 hours forecasting horizons with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 22% compared to 36% of the traditional Global Forecast System (GFS) method used by Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in mm are reduced by 50%. We present a first application of deep learning techniques for preliminary predictions of PWV in the Chajnantor area. The prediction performance shows significant improvements to traditional methods in 12 and 24 hours time windows. We also propose upgrades to improve our method in short (&lt; 1 hour) and long (&gt; 36 hours) forecasting timescales for future work.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Independent Component Analysis Scheme and its application to gravitational wave data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise subtraction is a crucial process in gravitational wave (GW) data analysis to improve the sensitivity of interferometric detectors. While linear noise coupling has been extensively studied and successfully mitigated using methods such as Wiener filtering, subtraction of non-linearly coupled and non-stationary noise remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel independent component analysis (ICA)-based framework designed to address non-linear coupling in noise subtraction. Building upon previous developments, we derive a method to estimate general quadratic noise coupling while maintaining computational transparency compared to machine learning approaches. The proposed method is tested with simulated data and real GW strain data from KAGRA. Our results demonstrate the potential of this framework to effectively mitigate complex noise structures, providing a promising avenue for improving the sensitivity of GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Dual-Backend Multibeam Position Switching Targeted SETI Observations toward Nearby Active Planet-Hosting Systems with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, lists the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) as one of its key scientific objectives. In this work, we present a targeted SETI observation for 7 nearby active stars utilizing the FAST L-band multibeam receiver, employing a observational strategy that combines position switching with multibeam tracking to balance on-source integration time with the accuracy of the beam response. Using both pulsar and SETI backends, we perform a comprehensive search for narrowband drifting signals with Doppler drift rates within $\pm 4 \ \mathrm{Hz\ s^{-1}}$ and channel-width periodic signal with periods between 0.12 and 100 s and duty cycles between 10\% and 50\%. No credible radio technosignatures were detected from any of the target systems. Based on this null result, we place constraints on the presence of transmitters at a 95\% confidence level, ruling out narrowband transmitters with with EIRP above $3.98\times10^8 \,\mathrm{W}$ and periodic transmitter with EIRP above $1.80\times10^{10} \,\mathrm{W}$,respectively, within the observation band.</description>

      <title>Uplink Pre-Compensation for Ground-to-Space Optical Communications Using Downlink Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uplink pre-compensation in ground-to-satellite optical links remains a problem, with an appropriate measurement of the wavefront error in the uplink path often not being available. We present a method that uses successive measurements of the readily accessible downlink beam to perform a tomographic reconstruction of the volume of atmosphere common to the downlink beam and the ground-station field-of-view. These measurements are done through the existing downlink wavefront sensor. From here, an estimate of the wavefront error along the uplink path can be obtained. We evaluate this method in simulation over representative atmospheric conditions and find good performance, especially for situations where the satellite point-ahead angle is many times greater than the atmosphere's isoplanatic angle. Compared to pre-compensation directly using the downlink phase, we find that this method estimates the uplink path with a residual mean-square wavefront error that is up to 8.6 times less. The hardware simplicity of this method makes it a promising solution for uplink pre-compensation implementations targeted at optical communications.</description>

      <title>The Variable Sky Through the OGLE Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) is one of the most productive and influential photometric sky surveys in the history of observational astronomy. Originally designed to detect dark matter through gravitational microlensing events, OGLE has evolved into a cornerstone of time-domain astrophysics, delivering three decades of two-band, high-cadence observations of approximately two billion stars across the Galactic bulge, disk, and Magellanic System. This review summarizes OGLE's key contributions to variable star research, including the discovery, classification and characterization of pulsating stars, eclipsing, ellipsoidal, and rotating variables, or irregular and eruptive stars. Particular emphasis is placed on the OGLE Collection of Variable Stars (OCVS), a publicly available and systematically expanded dataset that has become a fundamental resource for studies of stellar variability and evolution, Milky Way and other galaxies structure, microlensing, compact objects, exoplanets and more. The synergy between OGLE and other major sky surveys, including ASAS, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, Gaia, KMTNet, MACHO, MOA, TESS, PLATO, or ZTF further amplifies its scientific reach.</description>

Abstract: Comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a tool to account for the full range of environmental impacts of resource use in commodities or services is a first step in reducing these impacts. There is an increasing necessity to account for these aspects in the planning, running and end-of-life of scientific experiments and research infrastructure. In the following, the concept for an Open Research Life Cycle Assessment (ORLCA) repository is presented to support this endeavour. It is designed to comply fully with the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR).</description>

      <title>HARD: A Performance Portable Radiation Hydrodynamics Code based on FleCSI Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics And Radiation Diffusion} (HARD) is an open-source application for high-performance simulations of compressible hydrodynamics with radiation-diffusion coupling. Built on the FleCSI (Flexible Computational Science Infrastructure) framework, HARD expresses its computational units as tasks whose execution can be orchestrated by multiple back-end runtimes, including Legion, MPI, and HPX. Node-level parallelism is delegated to Kokkos, providing a single, portable code base that runs efficiently on laptops, small homogeneous clusters, and the largest heterogeneous supercomputers currently available. To ensure scientific reliability, HARD includes a regression-test suite that automatically reproduces canonical verification problems such as the Sod and LeBlanc shock tubes and the Sedov blast wave, comparing numerical solutions against known analytical results. The project is distributed under an OSI-approved license, hosted on GitHub, and accompanied by reproducible build scripts and continuous integration workflows. This combination of performance portability, verification infrastructure, and community-focused development makes HARD a sustainable platform for advancing radiation hydrodynamics research across multiple domains.</description>

      <title>HWO Target Stars and Systems: A Survey of Archival UV and X-ray Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess archival high-energy data for key stars on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Target Stars and Systems 2025 list, as stellar radiation is critical to shaping and interpreting planetary atmospheres. Using a sample of 98 nearby stars (HWO Tier 1 targets), we compile and evaluate X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data from archival eROSITA, Chandra, XMM-Newton, ROSAT, EUVE, Swift, FUSE, IUE, GALEX, and HST. We examine spectral and temporal coverage, assess data quality, and identify major gaps. UV data are moderately available, with most coverage coming from near-UV spectra from IUE. Far fewer stars have far-UV spectra, especially from HST. In the X-ray regime, some stars have high-quality spectra, while others are limited to shallow detections or broad-band photometry. A small fraction of the sample has both X-ray and UV spectra of sufficient quality to support full spectral energy distribution modeling. Truly comprehensive coverage across X-ray, extreme-UV, and both UV bands remains extremely rare. Most datasets are single-epoch, limiting assessments of variability and flares - key factors in atmospheric photochemistry and escape. Moreover, the lack of simultaneous or contemporaneous observations across bands adds further uncertainty. Our findings underscore the need for new space-based missions and coordinated multiwavelength campaigns, ideally with overlapping coverage, to improve stellar characterization for HWO. As several key observatories age and face potential decommissioning, there is a narrow window of opportunity to secure these critical data. Investing in this effort now will directly support the science goals of HWO and enhance future studies of planetary habitability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An international team of researchers has come together to undertake an ultra-broadband exploration of the deep radio sky. The superMIGHTEE project combines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre Array (SKA) MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep images at several $\mu$Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz--2.5 GHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the initial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum images covering a total of 9.9 deg$^2$ at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg$^2$ at 400 MHz in the XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source catalogs include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The redshift distribution of the sources extends to $z\sim4$ with a median value of $z=1$. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with the MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral properties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated population to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities of a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population exhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy injection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten significantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with peaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release. Subsequent releases will include spectropolarimetric and spectral line image cubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE ultra-wideband dataset is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, (abridged).</description>

      <title>A Radially Resolved Magnetic Field Threading the Disk of TW Hya</title>

Abstract: We present a new approach to detecting and characterizing a magnetic field in protoplanetary disks through the differential broadening of unpolarized molecular emission from CN. To demonstrate this technique, we apply it to new ALMA observations of the full complement of hyperfine components from the $N=1-0$ transition, achieving a spatial and spectral resolution of ${\approx}\,0.5^{\prime\prime}$ and $80~{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$, respectively. By fitting a model that incorporates the velocity structure of the disk, the potential non-LTE excitation of the molecule, and the Zeeman effect, we recover a radially resolved magnetic field with a strength of ${\sim}10~{\rm mG}$ between 60 and 120~au. The morphology of the field is also inferred through azimuthal variations in the line broadening, revealing a predominantly poloidal field at 60~au, sharply transitioning to one within the disk plane outside of the gap at 82~au. The signal-to-noise ratio of the data meant that the planar component was unable to be decomposed into toroidal and radial components. Lower limits on the local gas density ($n({\rm H_2}) \gtrsim 10^8~{\rm cm^{-3}}$) from the excitation analysis of the CN emission correspond to a lower limit between 0.1 and 0.01 for the plasma $\beta$.</description>

      <title>On Soft Clustering For Correlation Estimators</title>

Abstract: Properly estimating correlations between objects at different spatial scales necessitates $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ distance calculations. For this reason, most widely adopted packages for estimating correlations use clustering algorithms to approximate local trends. However, methods for quantifying the error introduced by this clustering have been understudied. In response, we present an algorithm for estimating correlations that is probabilistic in the way that it clusters objects, enabling us to quantify the uncertainty caused by clustering simply through model inference. These soft clustering assignments enable correlation estimators that are theoretically differentiable with respect to their input catalogs. Thus, we also build a theoretical framework for differentiable correlation functions and describe their utility in comparison to existing surrogate models. Notably, we find that repeated normalization and distance function calls slow gradient calculations and that sparse Jacobians destabilize precision, pointing towards either approximate or surrogate methods as a necessary solution to exact gradients from correlation functions. To that end, we close with a discussion of surrogate models as proxies for correlation functions. We provide an example that demonstrates the efficacy of surrogate models to enable gradient-based optimization of astrophysical model parameters, successfully minimizing a correlation function output. Our numerical experiments cover science cases across cosmology, from point spread function (PSF) modeling efforts to gravitational simulations to galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA).</description>

      <title>ABC-SN: Attention Based Classifier for Supernova Spectra</title>

Abstract: While significant advances have been made in photometric classification ahead of the millions of transient events and hundreds of supernovae (SNe) each night that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover, classifying SNe spectroscopically remains the best way to determine most subtypes of SNe. Traditional spectrum classification tools use template matching techniques (Blondin &amp; Tonry 2007) and require significant human supervision. Two deep learning spectral classifiers, DASH (Muthukrishna et al. 2019) and SNIascore (Fremling et al. 2021) define the state of the art, but SNIascore is a binary classifier devoted to maximizing the purity of the SN Ia-norm sample, while DASH is no longer maintained and the original work suffers from contamination of multi-epoch spectra in the training and test sets. We have explored several neural network architectures in order to create a new automated method for classifying SN subtypes, settling on an attention-based model we call ABC-SN. We benchmark our results against an updated version of DASH, thus providing the community with an up-to-date general purpose SN classifier. Our dataset includes ten different SN subtypes including subtypes of SN Ia, core collapse and interacting SNe. We find that ABC-SN outperforms DASH, and we discuss the possibility that modern SN spectra datasets contain label noise which limit the performance of all classifiers.</description>

      <title>MasconCube: Fast and Accurate Gravity Modeling with an Explicit Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geodesy of irregularly shaped small bodies presents fundamental challenges for gravitational field modeling, particularly as deep space exploration missions increasingly target asteroids and comets. Traditional approaches suffer from critical limitations: spherical harmonics diverge within the Brillouin sphere where spacecraft typically operate, polyhedral models assume unrealistic homogeneous density distributions, and existing machine learning methods like GeodesyNets and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN-GM) require extensive computational resources and training time. This work introduces MasconCubes, a novel self-supervised learning approach that formulates gravity inversion as a direct optimization problem over a regular 3D grid of point masses (mascons). Unlike implicit neural representations, MasconCubes explicitly model mass distributions while leveraging known asteroid shape information to constrain the solution space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse asteroid models including Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, and synthetic planetesimals demonstrates that MasconCubes achieve superior performance across multiple metrics. Most notably, MasconCubes demonstrate computational efficiency advantages with training times approximately 40 times faster than GeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass distributions. These results establish MasconCubes as a promising approach for mission-critical gravitational modeling applications requiring high accuracy, computational efficiency, and physical insight into internal mass distributions of irregular celestial bodies.</description>
