      <title>Tourism diversification paths in ski mid-mountain territories: any transformations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of adapting to global changes, the diversification of the tourist offer seems to be a solution for the mid-mountain areas, which are structured around and dependent on ski tourism. However, it remains unclear how tourism diversification occurs, what forms it can take and what it produces at a territorial scale. In this study, we apply a theory of regional diversification to the case of tourism in order to examine tourism diversification paths. We base our analysis on qualitative data collected on two French study areas: the intercommunities of the massif du Sancy and of the Haut-Chablais. Our results show a pattern in tourism diversification paths, following three steps that can lead to the abandonment of the perimeter of the ski resort. However, among the different types of tourism diversification trajectories, only a saltation form of tourism diversification can lead to the establishment of a larger and more diversified tourism system. Our findings also show that several types of tourism diversification paths can coexist at a territorial scale.</description>

      <title>Bridging Econometrics and AI: VaR Estimation via Reinforcement Learning and GARCH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an environment of increasingly volatile financial markets, the accurate estimation of risk remains a major challenge. Traditional econometric models, such as GARCH and its variants, are based on assumptions that are often too rigid to adapt to the complexity of the current market dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation, combining GARCH volatility models with deep reinforcement learning. Our approach incorporates directional market forecasting using the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) model, treating the task as an imbalanced classification problem. This architecture enables the dynamic adjustment of risk-level forecasts according to market conditions. Empirical validation on daily Eurostoxx 50 data covering periods of crisis and high volatility shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of VaR estimates, as well as a reduction in the number of breaches and also in capital requirements, while respecting regulatory risk thresholds. The ability of the model to adjust risk levels in real time reinforces its relevance to modern and proactive risk management.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data for Portfolios: A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03993v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation methods have always been instrumental in finance, and data-driven methods with minimal model specification, commonly referred to as generative models, have attracted increasing attention, especially after the success of deep learning in a broad range of fields. However, the adoption of these models in financial applications has not matched the growing interest, probably due to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative models, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by presenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and point out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally available. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and the desired uses by touching on a paradox: usual generative models inherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in particular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline for the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation standards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with stylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we previously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more accurate evaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversion strategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given application based on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data it has itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics as identifiability.</description>
