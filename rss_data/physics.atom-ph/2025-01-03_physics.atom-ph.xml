      <title>Coordinate Space Modification of Fock's Theory-Harmonic Tensors in the Quantum Coulomb Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Fock's fundamental theory of the hydrogen atom in momentum space which allows a realization of the previously predicted rotation group of a three-dimensional (3D) sphere in four-dimensional (4D) space. We then modify Fock's theory and abandon the momentum space description. To transform and simplify the theory, we use invariant tensor methods of electrostatics in 3D and 4D spaces. We find a coordinate 4D space where the Schrodinger equation becomes the 4D Laplace equation. The transition from harmonic 4D polynomials to original 3D physical space is algebraic and involves derivatives with respect to a coordinate that is interpreted as time. We obtain a differential equation for eigenfunctions in the momentum space and find its solutions. A concise calculation of the quadratic Stark effect is given. The Schwinger resolvent is derived by the method of harmonic polynomials. Vector ladder operators are also considered.</description>

      <title>An Updated Line List for Spectroscopic Investigation of G Stars II: Refined Solar Abundances via Extended Wavelength Coverage to 10 000 \AA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a line list for the abundance analysis of F and G type stars across the 4080-9675 A wavelength range. A systematic search employing lower excitation potentials, accurate log gf values, and an updated multiplet table led to the identification of 592 lines across 33 species (25 elements), including C, O, Mg (ionized), Al, P, S, Cu, Zr (neutral), and La. To determine the uncertainties in log gf values, we assessed solar abundance using a very high-resolution (R=1000000) disk-integrated solar spectrum. These lines were confirmed to be blend-free in the solar spectrum. The line list was further validated by analyzing the metal-poor star HD 218209 (G6V), which is notable for its well-documented and reliable abundance in literature. The abundances were obtained using the equivalent width (EW) method and further refined by applying the spectrum synthesis method. A comparative analysis with the Gaia ESO line list v.6, provided by the Gaia ESO collaboration, revealed additional neutral and ionized Fe lines. This extensively refined line list will facilitate precise stellar parameter determinations and accurate abundance analyses of spectra within the PolarBASE spectral library.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Subharmonics of the Electron Emission from Ultracold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most interesting phenomena in the ultracold plasmas are multiple subharmonics of the electron emission observed after its irradiation by radiowaves. Unfortunately, the early interpretation of this phenomenon as the so-called Tonks-Dattner resonances (i.e., actually the standing Langmuir waves) encounters a number of serious obstacles, such as a lack of the adequate boundary conditions, an incorrect dependence on the electron temperature, and an insensitivity to the shape of the cloud. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation based on the quasi-classical multiphoton ionization of the secondary Rydberg atoms formed in the expanding and cooling plasma clouds. As follows from our numerical simulations, the efficiency of such ionization really exhibits a series of well-expressed peaks. Moreover, this process is evidently irrelevant to the boundary conditions and global shape of the cloud. Therefore, this should be a viable alternative to the earlier idea of Tonks-Dattner resonances.</description>

      <title>Depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the solar photosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a series of studies investigating collisional depolarization of solar molecular lines like those of MgH, CN and C$_2$. It is focused on the case of the solar molecule C$_2$ which exhibits striking scattering polarization profiles although its intensity profiles are inconspicuous and barely visible. In fact, interpretation of the C$_2$ polarization in terms of magnetic fields is incomplete due to the almost complete lack of collisional data. This work aims at accurately computing the collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ by isotropic collisions with hydrogen atoms H~$(^2S_{1/2})$. We also investigate the solar implications of our findings. We utilize the MOLPRO package to obtain potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the electronic states $X ^1\Sigma^+_g$ and $a^3\Pi_u$ of C$_2$, and the MOLSCAT code to study the quantum dynamics of the C$_2$~$(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ systems. We use the tensorial irreducible basis to express the resulting collisional cross-sections and rates. Furthermore, sophisticated genetic programming techniques are employed to determine analytical expressions for the temperature and total molecular angular momentum dependence of these collisional rates. We obtain quantum depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions in the temperature range T=2,000--15,000~K. We also determine analytical expressions giving these rates as functions of the temperature and total molecular angular momentum. In addition, we show that isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen can only partially depolarize the lower state of C$_2$ lines, rather than completely. This highlights the limitations of the approximation of neglecting lower-level polarization while modeling the polarization of C$_2$ lines.</description>

      <title>Trilepton and tetralepton bound and resonant states: the QED counterpart of multiquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first prediction of tetralepton resonant states containing muons, extending beyond the simplest tetralepton system, dipositronium ($\mathrm{Ps}_2$). With the rapid advancements in experimental facilities, the production and study of these intriguing states may be within reach. We perform a comprehensive analysis of S-wave trilepton and tetralepton systems within the framework of a QED Coulomb potential. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the three- or four-body Schr\"odinger equation and utilize the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. We uncover a series of bound and resonant states in the trilepton systems $e^+e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-$, $e^+e^+\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-$, as well as the tetralepton systems $e^+e^+e^-e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-e^-$. The energies of these states range from $-30$ eV to $-1$ eV below the total mass of three or four leptons, with their widths varying from less than $0.01$ eV to approximately $0.07$ eV. Additionally, we calculate the spin configurations and root mean square radii of these states, providing insight into their spatial structures. No bound or resonant states are found in the trilepton $e^+\mu^+e^-$, $\mu^+e^+\mu^-$ systems, nor in the tetralepton $\mu^+e^+\mu^-e^-$ system. A comparison with fully heavy tetraquark systems reveals that the additional color degree of freedom in QCD results in the absence of low-energy bound and resonant states. However, this extra degree of freedom allows for a broader range of $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers to produce resonant states, highlighting the rich complexity of QCD systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nitrogen-Vacancy Color Centers on the Optical Kerr Effect in Diamond: A Femtosecond Z-Scan Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores nonlinear optical effects in diamond crystals doped with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, focusing on the optical Kerr effect in the infrared spectral region. By employing the Z-scan technique with 230 fs laser pulses at a wavelength of 1032~nm, we investigate the nonlinear refractive index of high-purity and NV-containing diamond crystals at NV concentrations of 0.3 ppm and 4.5 ppm. The results demonstrate a pronounced anisotropy in the nonlinear refractive index, which exhibits a four-fold rotational symmetry, with its amplitude reduced by the NV concentration. The reduction in non-linear susceptibility is linked to the negative contribution of NV centers, modeled as two-level systems upon a strong, laser field, red-detuned relative to their resonance frequency. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between NV centers and nonlinear optical properties of diamond, offering potential pathways for tunable nonlinear optics applications.</description>

      <title>Parallel assembly of neutral atom arrays with an SLM using linear phase interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present fast parallel rearrangement of single atoms in optical tweezers into arbitrary geometries by updating holograms displayed by an ultra fast spatial light modulator. Using linear interpolation of the tweezer position and the optical phase between the start and end arrays, we can calculate and display holograms every 2.76(2) ms. To show the versatility of our method, we sort the same atomic sample into multiple geometries with success probabilities exceeding 99 % per imaging and rearrangement cycle. This makes the method a useful tool for rearranging large atom arrays for quantum computation and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic VQE calculations of molecular electric dipole moments on trapped ion quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is among the most actively studied topics in atomic and molecular calculations on quantum computers, yet few studies address properties other than energies or account for relativistic effects. This work presents high-precision 18-qubit relativistic VQE simulations for calculating the permanent electric dipole moments (PDMs) of BeH to RaH molecules on traditional computers, and 6- and 12-qubit PDM computations for SrH on IonQ quantum devices. To achieve high precision on current noisy intermediate scale era quantum hardware, we apply various resource reduction methods, including Reinforcement Learning and causal flow preserving ZX-Calculus routines, along with error mitigation and post-selection techniques. Our approach reduces the two-qubit gate count in our 12-qubit circuit by 99.71%, with only a 2.35% trade-off in precision for PDM when evaluated classically within a suitably chosen active space. On the current generation IonQ Forte-I hardware, the error in PDM is -1.17% relative to classical calculations and only 1.21% compared to the unoptimized circuit.</description>

      <title>Field-free, Quasi-continuous Operation of Optical Nanofiber Interface with Two-dimensional Ferromagnetic Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft ferromagnetic foil uniformizes Tesla-level magnetic fields generated by attached permanent magnets, producing a uniform and electronically tunable surface field on the opposite side. By arranging $n$ precisely fabricated rectangular foils, a nearly ideal magnetic quadrupole field with a substantial gradient can be created at center. This robust and tunable field configuration is useful for 2-dimensional magneto-optical trapping (2D-MOT) and magnetic guiding of cold atoms. In this work, by aligning an optical nanofiber (ONF) to the zero-field line of a 2-foil-based planar 2D-MOT, we demonstrate field-free operation of the quantum optical interface in a quasi-continuous manner, without switching off the magnetic field. Transient transmission spectroscopy is performed with a measurement repetition rate as high as 250~kHz. An anomalous line broadening is observed, which is not fully understood, but is partly explained by a small residual field along the zero-field line. Through additional field measurements and simulations, we clarify that this residual field can be eliminated in an $n$=4 assembly, resulting in an ultra-straight 2D trap to support efficient sub-Doppler cooling and uniform light-atom interaction over exceptionally long field-free distances $l$. With the strong field gradient to support atom guiding, the ferromagnetic device may also enable new quantum optical scenarios featuring interactions between co-guided atoms and photons.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of molecular orientations: topological classification, complete entanglement, and fault-tolerant encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, we reproduce a molecule's admissible angular momentum states known from spectroscopy, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how the state space of a molecular species is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify molecular species whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.</description>
