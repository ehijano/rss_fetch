      <title>Comparison of Forteo and Teriparatide on Improvements in Bone Mineral Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PF708 teriparatide, manufactured by Alvogen, was approved through the 505(B)(2) application after the expiration of Forteo market exclusivity in October 2019. The 505(B)(2) application allows safety and efficacy information to come from studies not conducted by the applicant if it is demonstrated that the proposed product shares characteristics (active ingredient, dose, route of administration, strength) with the reference product and comparable pharmacokinetic data is established. Real-world data is thus needed to demonstrate equivalent safety and efficacy between Forteo and PF708 teriparatide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients treated with either Forteo or PF708 teriparatide for 18-24 months. This retrospective chart review included osteoporotic patients &gt; 18 years of age who received PF708 teriparatide or Forteo prescriptions from the practice location and initiated therapy between October 1, 2019 and October 31, 2022. The primary endpoint was percent change from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. A total of 108 patients were included: 27 (median age 67 years, 88.9% female) in the PF708 teriparatide group and 81 (median age 68 years, 85.2% female) in the Forteo group. There was no significant difference in median change from baseline BMD of lumbar spine (+9.6% vs +7.7%, P= 0.56), left femoral neck (1.5% vs 2.8%, P= 0.39), right femoral neck (+1.6% vs +4.4%, P= 0.14), left total hip (+2.4% vs +3.2%, P= 0.24), or right total hip (0.0% vs +1.4% , P= 0.71) with PF708 teriparatide vs Forteo, respectively. In this small retrospective study, effect on BMD and reported adverse events were similar between PF708 teriparatide and Forteo when used for the recommended duration of therapy.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model of Wound Healing: Effects of Local and Systemic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model formulated as a system of first-order non-linear ordinary differential equations, aimed at examining the effects of different factors, classified as local and systemic factors on a wound healing process. Specifically, the model incorporates pathogens, inflammatory cells, fibroblast cells, collagen, and the initial wound size. The variables utilized in the model lack specific units since they represent combined responses of different cell types. As such, these variables serve as indicators of the relative behaviors of these cellular populations. The feasibility of the model solution is examined through the demonstration of its positivity. A threshold, denoted $R_w$, is established to determine the conditions necessary for the existence of a wound-free equilibrium. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the contribution of parameters to the behavior of fibroblast cells and $R_w$, which are crucial to the wound healing process. Through numerical simulations, it is demonstrated that factors such as oxygen levels, pathogen activity, inflammatory cell activity, age, smoking, alcoholism, and stress exert considerable influence on the behaviors of these cells, thereby contributing to delayed wound healing and the occurrence of chronic wounds.</description>

      <title>Neural cellular automata: applications to biology and beyond classical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with trainable, differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive self-regulatory dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between localized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular, tissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture perspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and robotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target patterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given their immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on cutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same principles of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their governing self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized interactions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning and control.</description>

      <title>NIRS: An Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in Acute Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) strategies as alternatives to traditional ventilation methods. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there is a significant challenge to its best use under all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. Our goal is to develop NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity, interoperability, and clinical decision-making.
  Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical clinical scenarios. We used SPARQL queries to retrieve and test targeted inferences.
  Results: The ontology has 129 classes, 11 object properties, and 17 data properties across 886 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 361 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes: for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.
  Conclusion: We developed an ontology that captures NIRS modalities in a unified framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies, which may need to be expanded to encompass a broader scope.</description>

      <title>Effective resource allocation to combat invasions of the spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) and similar pests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spotted lanternfly is rapidly establishing itself as a major insect pest with global implications. Despite significant management efforts, its spread continues in invaded regions, and refined management strategies are required. A recent study introduced a model that generalized the results of empirical control efficacy studies by incorporating population dynamics and incomplete delivery. In particular, a generalized population growth formula was derived, providing the minimum proportion of a population that must be treated with a given control to induce population decline. However, this model could not address the more relevant question of how best to deploy a control to minimize population growth. Here, we extend this model and formula to address this question in various settings. When the effect of control is proportional to effort, we show that exhaustive sequential deployment of stage-specific controls, ordered by efficacy, is optimal. When control effects exhibit diminishing returns with effort, we derive a formula for when to switch controls, providing an effective strategy in situations where management resources may vary or be cut at any time. We also use numerical global optimization methods to obtain strategies when resources are fixed a priori. Both strategies outperform random deployment, which can result in disastrous outcomes. Our results demonstrate that adopting an effective strategy for deploying stage-specific controls is essential for managing the spotted lanternfly. However, we found no papers addressing this topic in the lanternfly literature, nor information on whether such strategies are used. Given the limited resources available to combat the lanternfly, it is critical that they are used effectively. The approach introduced here, along with other optimization methods used in related fields, can contribute to this goal.</description>
