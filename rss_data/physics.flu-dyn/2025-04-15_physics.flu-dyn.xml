      <title>Virgin and Under-Investigated Areas of Research in Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is mainly about the areas of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics which are not investigated or not appropriately and sufficiently investigated. In fact, this should also include emerging areas of research in the field of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics due to new scientific and technological developments and advancements. The purpose of the paper is to highlight and draw the attention to these areas so that researchers (especially the young researchers and new-comers to research such as PhD students) invest their resources and efforts in these areas instead of investing in other areas which are previously investigated and hence they are of less priority from this aspect. Apart from the obvious benefit of "leveling up" in research, the attention to these rather neglected and non-explored areas of research can be beneficial at the scientific and individual levels since it can lead to breakthroughs and new discoveries in these areas of research by inspecting and assessing their potentials and impacts at the theoretical and practical levels and probing their beneficial applications. We will also provide a brief discussion about the possibility of introducing novel tools and methods in these areas of research (and in non-Newtonian fluid mechanics research in general) as well as highlighting some of the existing limitations of the past and current research in the field of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics (noting that this discussion should help in achieving the ultimate objective of this investigation).</description>

      <title>Yield Stages of Viscoplastic Fluids in Tubes of Elliptical, Rectangular, Triangular and Annular Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue our previous investigation about the use of stress function in the flow of generalized Newtonian fluids through conduits of circular and non-circular (or/and multiply connected) cross sections where we visualize the stages of yield in the process of flow of viscoplastic fluids through tubes of elliptical, rectangular, triangular and annular cross sections. The purpose of this qualitative investigation is to provide an initial idea about the expected yield development in the process of flow of yield-stress fluids through tubes of some of the most common non-circular (and non-simply-connected) cross sectional geometries.</description>

      <title>Bridging advection and diffusion in the encounter dynamics of sedimenting marine snow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sinking marine snow particles, composed primarily of organic matter, control the global export of photosynthetically fixed carbon from the ocean surface to depth. The fate of sedimenting marine snow particles is in part regulated by their encounters with suspended, micron-sized objects, which leads to mass accretion by the particles and potentially alters their buoyancy, and with bacteria that can colonize the particles and degrade them. Their collision rates are typically calculated using two types of models focusing either on direct (ballistic) interception with a finite interaction range, or advective-diffusive capture with a zero interaction range. Since the range of applicability of the two models is unknown, and many relevant marine encounter scenarios span across both regimes, quantifying such encounters remains challenging, because the two models yield asymptotically different predictions at high P\'{e}clet numbers. Here, we reconcile the two limiting approaches by quantifying the encounters in the general case using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Solving the advection-diffusion equation in Stokes flow around a sphere to model mass transfer to a large sinking particle by small yet finite-sized objects, we determine a new formula for the Sherwood number as a function of two dimensionless parameters: the P\'{e}clet number and the ratio of small to large particle sizes. We find that diffusion can play a significant role in generating encounters even at high Pe. At Pe as high as $10^6$, the direct interception model underestimates the encounter rate by up to two orders of magnitude. This overlooked contribution of diffusion to encounters suggests that important processes affecting the fate of marine snow, such as colonization by bacteria and plankton or accretion of neutrally buoyant gels, may proceed at a rate much faster than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Real-scale Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Tsunami Runup Modelling, with application to 3-D tsunami urban flows in Cilacap, South Java, Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The risk posed by tsunami waves is currently modelled over bare-earth representations by tsunami models. The complex flows around buildings and structures are crucial to represent the true state of the tsunami wave elevation, speed and forces exerted on buildings. Such 3D simulations have been unachievable for real scale modelling at a reasonable computational cost. We present here for the first time the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) for tsunami simulation in a real setting of large scale (around 1 km). Our illustration is for Cilacap, Indonesia as constitutes a blueprint for future scenarios in South Java. SPH allows for the efficient modelling of shocks and complex interations of the flows with the structures. We also offer a range of test cases of increasing complexity and realism to tune and validate such realistic simulations, including the well known simplified beach of Seaside, Oregon at scale 1:50. We are able to reproduce realistic wave heights, velocities and even observed eddies. We provide guidance and discuss the various choices in terms of flow parametrisations, boundary conditions, and the trade-off of fidelity. computational cost. As a result, Probabilistic Tsunami Risk Assessments (PTRA) will become possible by making use a of combination of regional modelling of tsunamis with depth-average models (generation and propagation) as well as coastal modelling using SPH.</description>

      <title>Timescales and Statistics of Shock-induced Droplet Breakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detonation-based propulsion devices, such as rotating detonation engines (RDEs), must be able to leverage the higher energy densities of liquid fuels in order for them to be utilized in practical contexts. This necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the physical processes and timescales that dictate the shock-induced breakup of liquid droplets. These processes are difficult to probe and quantify experimentally, often limiting measurements to macroscopic properties. Here, fundamental mechanisms in such interactions are elucidated through detailed numerical simulation of Mach 2 and 3 shock waves interacting with 100 $\mu$m water droplets. Using a thermodynamically consistent two-phase formulation with adaptive mesh refinement, the simulations capture droplet surface instabilities and atomization into secondary droplets in great detail. The results show that droplet breakup occurs through a coupled multi-stage process, including droplet flattening, formation of surface instabilities and piercing, and the shedding of secondary droplets from the ligaments of the deformed primary droplet. When considering the dimensionless timescale of Ranger and Nicholls ($\tau$), these processes occur at similar rates for the different shock strengths. The PDFs for the Sauter mean diameters of secondary droplets are bimodal log-normal distributions at $\tau=2$. Modest differences in the degree and rate of liquid mass transfer into droplets less than 5 $\mu$m in diameter are hypothesized to partially derive from differences in droplet surface piercing modes. These results are illustrative of the complex multi-scale processes driving droplet breakup and have implications for the ability of shocks to effectively process liquid fuels.</description>

      <title>A Robust Lattice Boltzmann Method for Interface-Bound Transport of a Passive Scalar: Application to Surfactant-Laden Multiphase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of a passive scalar restricted on interfaces, which is advected by the fluid motions have numerous applications in multiphase transport phenomena. A prototypical example is the advection-diffusion of the concentration field of an insoluble surfactant along interfaces. A sharp-interface model of the surfactant transport on the interface (Stone, Phys. Fluids A, 1990) has been extended to a diffuse-interface formulation based on a delta-function regularization by Teigen et al. (in Comm. Math. Sci., 2009). However, the latter approach involves singular terms which can compromise its numerical implementation. Recently, Jain and Mani (in Annual Research Briefs, CTR, Stanford University, 2022) circumvented this issue by applying a variable transformation, which effectively leads to a generalized interface-bound scalar transport equation with an additional interfacial confining flux term. The resulting formulation has similarities with the conservative Allen-Cahn equation (CACE) used for tracking of interfaces. In this paper, we will discuss a novel robust central moment lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to simulate the interface-bound advection-diffusion transport equation of a scalar field proposed in Teigen et al. by applying Jain and Mani's transformation. It is coupled with another LB scheme for the CACE to compute the evolving interfaces, and the resulting algorithm is validated against some benchmark problems available in the literature. As further extension, we have coupled it with our central moment LB flow solver for the two-fluid motions, which is modulated by the Marangoni stresses resulting from the variation of the surface tension with the local surfactant concentration modeled via the Langmuir isotherm. This is then validated by simulating insoluble surfactant-laden drop deformation and break-up in a shear flow at various capillary numbers.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck Model Based Central Moment Lattice Boltzmann Method for Effective Simulations of Thermal Convective Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck (FP) equation represents the drift-diffusive processes in kinetic models. It can also be regarded as a model for the collision integral of the Boltzmann-type equation to represent thermo-hydrodynamic processes in fluids. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a drastically simplified discretization of the Boltzmann equation. We construct two new FP-based LBMs, one for recovering the Navier-Stokes equations and the other for simulating the energy equation, where, in each case, the effect of collisions is represented as relaxations of different central moments to their respective attractors. Such attractors are obtained by matching the changes in various discrete central moments under collision with the continuous central moments prescribed by the FP model. As such, the resulting central moment attractors depend on the lower order moments and the diffusion tensor parameters and significantly differ from those based on the Maxwell distribution. The diffusion tensor parameters for evolving higher moments in simulating fluid motions at relatively low viscosities are chosen based on a renormalization principle. The use of such central moment formulations in modeling the collision step offers significant improvements in numerical stability, especially for simulations of thermal convective flows with a wide range of variations in the transport coefficients. We develop new FP central moment LBMs for thermo-hydrodynamics in both two- and three-dimensions and demonstrate the ability of our approach to accurately simulate various cases involving thermal convective buoyancy-driven flows, especially at high Rayleigh numbers. Moreover, we show significant improvements in numerical stability of our FP central moment LBMs when compared to other existing central moment LBMs using the Maxwell distribution in achieving higher Peclet numbers for mixed convection flows.</description>

      <title>ELPINN: Eulerian Lagrangian Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained widespread popularity for solving inverse and forward problems across a range of scientific and engineering domains. However, most existing PINN frameworks are limited to the Eulerian domain, where physical quantities are described at fixed spatial locations. In this work, we propose a novel PINN-based framework that couples Eulerian and Lagrangian perspectives by using particle trajectory data to reconstruct Eulerian velocity and pressure fields.
  We evaluate the performance of our method across three distinct fluid flow scenarios: two-dimensional external flow past a cylinder, two-dimensional internal flow in a confined geometry, and three-dimensional internal flow inside an airplane cabin. In all three cases, we successfully reconstruct the velocity field from Lagrangian particle data. Moreover, for the 2D external and internal flows, we recover the pressure field solely through the physics-informed learning process, without using any direct pressure measurements.
  We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the effects of temporal resolution and particle count on the reconstruction accuracy. Our results show that smaller time-step sizes significantly improve the predictions, while the total number of particles has a comparatively smaller influence.
  These findings establish the potential of our coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN framework as a powerful tool for enhancing experimental methods such as Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV). Looking ahead, this approach may be extended to infer hidden quantities such as pressure in three-dimensional flows or material properties like viscosity, opening new avenues for data-driven fluid dynamics in complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Magnetorheological Characterization of Blood Analogues Seeded with Paramagnetic Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic particles can be useful in various medical applications, gaining access to the whole body if deployed in the blood stream. Localised drug delivery, haemorrhage control and cancer treatment are among the applications with potential to become revolutionary therapies. Despite this interest, a magnetorheological characterisation of particle-seeded blood has yet to be achieved. In this work, we evaluate the magnetorheological response of polymeric blood analogues seeded with paramagnetic particles in different concentrations, under the effects of a uniform, density-varying magnetic field. Through steady shear experiments, we encounter the usual magnetically-induced shear thinning response, and oscillatory shear results point toward some significant alterations in the fluids' microstructure. However, experimental limitations make it difficult to accurately evaluate the oscillatory shear response of such rheologically subtle fluids, limiting both the quality and quantity of achievable information. Despite experimental limitations, our results demonstrate that magnetic fields can induce marked and quantifiable rheological changes in seeded blood analogues. The framework established here provides a foundation for future studies on real blood samples and for the design of magnetically responsive biomedical systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotating helices in viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a pair of rigid rotating helices in a viscous fluid, as a model for bacterial flagellar bundle and a prototype of microfluidic pumps. Combining experiments with hydrodynamic modeling, we examine how spacing and phase difference between the two helices affect their torque, flow field and fluid transport capacity at low Reynolds numbers. Hydrodynamic coupling reduces the torque when the helices rotate in phase at constant angular speed, but increases the torque when they rotate out of phase. We identify a critical phase difference, at which the hydrodynamic coupling vanishes despite the close spacing between the helices. A simple model, based on the flow characteristics and positioning of a single helix, is constructed, which quantitatively predicts the torque of the helical pair in both unbounded and confined systems. Lastly, we show the influence of spacing and phase difference on the axial flux and the pump efficiency of the helices. Our findings shed light on the function of bacterial flagella and provide design principles for efficient low-Reynolds-number pumps.</description>

      <title>Controlling Droplets at the Tips of Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex wetting behaviors of fibrous materials are rooted in the behaviors of individual droplets attached to pairs of fibers. Here, we study the splitting of a droplet held between the tips of two cylindrical fibers. We discover a sharp transition between two post-rupture states, navigated by changing the angle between the rods, in agreement with our bifurcation analysis. Depinning of the bridge contact line can lead to a much larger asymmetry between the volume of liquid left on each rod. This second scenario enables the near-complete transfer of an aqueous glycerol droplet between two identical vinylpolysiloxane fibers. We leverage this response in a device that uses a ruck to pass a droplet along a train of fibers, a proof-of-concept for the geometric control of droplets on deformable, architected surfaces.</description>

      <title>A generic framework for extending Miles' approach to wind-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the energy transfer from wind to waves is an important but complex topic, typically based on phenomenology or on technically challenging analysis, performed case by case. Here we show that the approach by Miles, initially proposed for a still and infinitely deep ocean of inviscid water, is in fact generic: it can easily be adapted, as we derive directly from the mathematical structure of the arguments put forward by Miles. We establish simple transformations, which deduce growth rates in complex hydrodynamic situations directly from those in Miles' conditions. The corresponding conversion factors are determined from the hydrodynamic water pressure under the effect of a propagating surface wave, and can be determined without needing to further analyse wind and air flow. We reproduce a variety of results for different hydrodynamic situations to show how such generalisations can be achieved with surprisingly little calculations and without any additional numerical effort, which should make the approach interesting for real-life applications.</description>

      <title>Bending-compression coupling in extensible slender microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undulatory slender objects have been a central theme in the hydrodynamics of swimming at low Reynolds number, where the slender body is usually assumed to be inextensible, although some microorganisms and artificial microrobots largely deform with compression and extension. Here, we theoretically study the coupling between the bending and compression/extension shape modes, using a geometrical formulation of microswimmer hydrodynamics to deal with the non-commutative effects between translation and rotation. By means of a coarse-grained minimal model and systematic perturbation expansions for small bending and compression/extension, we analytically derive the swimming velocities and report three main findings. First, we revisit the role of anisotropy in the drag ratio of the resistive force theory and generally demonstrate that no motion is possible for uniform compression with isotropic drag. We then find that the bending-compression/extension coupling generates lateral and rotational motion, which enhances the swimmer's manoeuvrability, as well as changes in progressive velocity at a higher order of expansion, while the coupling effects depend on the phase difference between the two modes. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of often-overlooked Lie bracket contributions in computing net locomotion from a deformation gait. Our study sheds light on compression as a forgotten degree of freedom in swimmer locomotion, with important implications for microswimmer hydrodynamics, including understanding of biological locomotion mechanisms and design of microrobots.</description>

      <title>Fundamental evaluation of the pressure gradient for lubrication flows in varying channels: Application to inertial Newtonian flow in a linear channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive general analytical expressions for the pressure gradient of a viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid in a symmetric channel with slowly varying geometry. Using classic lubrication theory and assuming isothermal, incompressible, and steady inertial flow, we present four fundamental methods for deriving these expressions: the first is based on the momentum balance, the second on the total force balance in the channel, the third on a higher moment of the momentum balance combined with the continuity equation, and the fourth on the mechanical energy of the flow. Additionally, we formally prove that the first and second methods yield identical expressions and highlight the significance of the exact analytical solution for the Oldroyd-B model along the channel walls. For a Newtonian fluid at the creeping flow limit the first and second methods give the well-known result that the pressure gradient along the channel equals the shear stress at the walls. The differences between the methods and the outcomes are also presented and discussed. Additionally, we derive a new set of lubrication equations based on the streamfunction, transformed coordinates that map the variable channel wall shape onto fixed ones, and new components of the viscoelastic extra-stress tensor. This formulation facilitates a much easier implementation of the continuity equation, the total mass balance, and the total force balance in the system, ensuring that non-physical or spurious solutions do not arise. Finally, we present in detail a limiting nonlinear case by considering the Newtonian inertial flow in a linearly varying channel. Through the implementation of our formulation, we provide strong evidence for the theoretical and numerical equivalence of the general expressions for the pressure gradient and the average pressure drop in the channel.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning an Large Language Model for Automating Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations typically demands extensive domain expertise, limiting broader access. Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced scientific computing, their use in automating CFD workflows is underdeveloped. We introduce a novel approach centered on domain-specific LLM adaptation. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on NL2FOAM, our custom dataset of 28716 natural language-to-OpenFOAM configuration pairs with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, we enable direct translation from natural language descriptions to executable CFD setups. A multi-agent framework orchestrates the process, autonomously verifying inputs, generating configurations, running simulations, and correcting errors. Evaluation on a benchmark of 21 diverse flow cases demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 88.7% solution accuracy and 82.6% first-attempt success rate. This significantly outperforms larger general-purpose models like Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct, while also requiring fewer correction iterations and maintaining high computational efficiency. The results highlight the critical role of domain-specific adaptation in deploying LLM assistants for complex engineering workflows.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical eddy-viscosity and backscattering closures for 2D geophysical turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based closures such as eddy-viscosity and backscattering models are widely used for large-eddy simulation (LES) of geophysical turbulence for applications including weather and climate prediction. However, these closures have parameters that are often chosen empirically. Here, for the first time, we semi-analytically derive the parameters of the Leith and Smagorinsky eddy-viscosity closures and the Jansen-Held backscattering closure for 2D geophysical turbulence. The semi-analytical derivation provides these parameters up to a constant that can be estimated from the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum of a few snapshots of direct numerical simulation (DNS) or other high-fidelity (eddy resolving) simulations, or even obtained from earlier analytical work based on renormalization group. The semi-analytically estimated closure parameters agree with those obtained from online (a-posteriori) learning in several setups of 2D geophysical turbulence in our earlier work. LES with closures that use these parameters can correctly reproduce the key statistics of DNS, including those of the extreme events and interscale energy and enstrophy transfers, and outperform the baselines (dynamic Leith and Smagorinsky and the latter with standard parameter).</description>

      <title>Virtual domain extension for imposing boundary conditions in flow simulation using pre-trained local neural operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds up a virtual domain extension (VDE) framework for imposing boundary conditions (BCs) in flow simulation using pre-trained local neural operator (LNO). It creates extended virtual domains to the input function to compensate for the corrosion nature of computational domains during LNO inference, thus turns the implementation of BC into the determination of field values on the extended domain. Several strategies to calculate the field values are proposed and validated in solving numerical examples, including padding operation, direct imposition, pressure symmetry, and optimization by backpropagation, and compared with boundary imposition in traditional solvers. It is found that the large time interval of LNO induces a relatively wide near-boundary domain to be processed, thus imposing BC on only a few nodes near the boundary following the immersed boundary conception in traditional solvers can hardly achieve high accuracy. With appropriate values assigned on the extended virtual domains, VDE can accurately impose BCs and lead to reasonable flow field predictions. This work provides a guidance for imposing BCs reliably in LNO prediction, which could facilitate the reuse of pre-trained LNO in more applications.</description>

      <title>Incipient motion of a single particle on a regular substrate in an oscillatory flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate and model the initiation of motion of a single particle on a structured substrate within an oscillatory boundary layer, following a mechanistic approach. By deterministically relating forces and torques acting on the particle to the instantaneous ambient flow, the effects of flow unsteadiness are captured, revealing rich particle dynamics. Our laboratory experiments in an oscillatory flow tunnel characterise the initiation and early stages of motion with particle imaging velocimetry measurements yielding the flow conditions at the motion threshold. The experiments validate and complement results from particle-resolved direct numerical simulations. These simulations provide detailed insights by combining an immersed boundary method with a discrete element method that incorporates a static friction contact model. Within the explored region of the parameter space, the movable particle rolls without sliding on the underlying substrate, indicating that motion initiation is governed by an unbalanced torque rather than a force. Both experimental and numerical results show excellent agreement with an analytical torque balance that includes the hydrodynamic torque modelled on the basis of the theoretical Stokes velocity profile, and contributions of lift, added mass, and externally imposed pressure gradient. Additional regimes of motion that are absent in steady conditions are identified, in particular those related to particle inertia and flow reversal time. Our deterministic approach allows the prediction of the phase of incipient particle motion without relying on empirical estimates of threshold values, and can even be extended to a wide range of flow and substrate conditions, as long as turbulence is absent and interactions with other movable particles are negligible.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of discrete Boltzmann simulation for supersonic flows: Influencing factors, coupling mechanisms and optimization strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersonic flow simulations face challenges in trans-scale modeling, numerical stability, and complex field analysis due to inherent nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and multiscale characteristics. The discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) provides a multiscale kinetic modeling framework and analysis tool to capture complex discrete/nonequilibrium effects. While the numerical scheme plays a fundamental role in DBM simulations, a comprehensive stability analysis remains lacking. Similar to LBM, the complexity mainly arises from the intrinsic coupling between velocity and spatiotemporal discretizations, compared with CFD. This study applies von Neumann stability analysis to investigate key factors influencing DBM simulation stability, including phase-space discretization, thermodynamic nonequilibrium (TNE) levels, spatiotemporal schemes, initial conditions, and model parameters. Key findings include: (i) the moment-matching approach outperforms expansion- and weighting-based methods in the test simulations; (ii) increased TNE enhances system nonlinearity and the intrinsic nonlinearity embedded in the model equations, amplifying instabilities; (iii) additional viscous dissipation based on distribution functions improves stability but distorts flow fields and alters constitutive relations; (iv) larger CFL numbers and relative time steps degrade stability, necessitating appropriate time-stepping strategies. To assess the stability regulation capability of DBMs across TNE levels, stability-phase diagrams and probability curves are constructed via morphological analysis within the moment-matching framework. These diagrams identify common stable parameter regions across model orders. This study reveals key factors and coupling mechanisms affecting DBM stability and proposes strategies for optimizing equilibrium distribution discretization, velocity design, and parameter selection in supersonic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for incompressible turbulent mixing described by 3D NS equations, with a passive scalar (concentration, temperature, or other scalar field) driven by the turbulent velocity field. Using our recent solution of decaying turbulence in terms of the Euler ensemble, we represent the correlation functions of a passive scalar as statistical averages over this ensemble. The statistical limit, corresponding to decaying turbulence, can be computed in quadrature. We find the decay spectrum and the scaling functions of the pair correlation and match them with physical and real experiments.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-B\'enard-Marangoni convection in binary fluids - Effect of miscibility on oscillatory mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pair of fluids, FC72- 1cSt silicone oil, exhibiting temperature-sensitive miscibility gap is considered in this study to investigate the classical Rayleigh-B\'enard-Marangoni (RBM) instability. The system of fluids is considered at distinct temperatures to elucidate the effect of the degree of miscibility between the two fluids. We employ a modified phase- field model to track the evolution of the RBM instability as the temperature of the system is varied. The proposed model correctly initializes the concentration profile and also properly leads to a miscibility-dependent surface tension. A spectral-collocation-based method is employed to solve the linearized governing equations that help investigate the onset characteristics of the convection, i.e., both the critical values and the mode of convection onset, which could be either oscillatory or stationary. The results reveal the dependence of the window of oscillatory convection on the degree of miscibility between the two fluids. The coupling between the Korteweg stresses and the degree of miscibility governs the thermal energy required to provoke the system into the convective state. The onset of RBM flow is analyzed parametrically, with the successive rise in the strength of the Marangoni component.</description>

      <title>Proteinoid spikes: from protocognitive to universal approximating agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteinoids, as soft matter fluidic systems, are computational substrates that have been recently proposed for their analog computing capabilities. Such systems exhibit oscillatory electrical activity because of cationic and anionic exchange inside and outside such gels. It has also been recently shown that this (analog) electrical activity, when sampled at fixed time intervals, can be used to reveal their underlying information-theoretic, computational code. This code, for instance, can be expressed in the (digital) language of Boolean gates and QR codes. Though, this might seem as a good evidence that proteinoid substrates have computing abilities when subjected to analog-to-digital transition, the leap from their underlying computational code to computing abilities is not well explained yet. How can the electrical activity inside proteinoids, whilst of chemical origin, be able them to perform computational tasks at the first place? In addition, proteinoids are also hypothesised to be the chemical manifestation of the primordial soup, i.e., as potential entities with proto-cognitive abilities. In this work, we show that the proteinoid substrate, owing to its chemical makeup and proto-cognitive abilities, can be interpreted as an universal approximator, thanks to a novel equivalence between the electrical activity exhibited by the substrate and a deep Rectified Linear Unit (deep ReLU) network. We exemplify this equivalence by constructing a prediction algorithm which acts as a binary classification model and extract 16-dimensional vector data from the proteinoid spike, in order to perform predictions with 70.41\% accuracy. We conclude by drawing an equivalence between the the deep ReLU network and the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, whose origin can be traced back to Hilbert's thirteenth problem.</description>

      <title>Designing optimal elastic filaments for viscous propulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propulsion of many eukaryotic cells is generated by flagella, flexible slender filaments that are actively oscillating in space and time. The dynamics of these biological appendages have inspired the design of many types of artificial microswimmers. The magnitude of the filament's viscous propulsion depends on the time-varying shape of the filament, and that shape depends in turn on the spatial distribution of the bending rigidity of the filament. In this work, we rigorously determine the relationship between the mechanical (bending) properties of the filament and the viscous thrust it produces using mathematical optimisation. Specifically, by considering a model system (a slender elastic filament with an oscillating slope at its base), we derive the optimal bending rigidity function along the filament that maximises the time-averaged thrust produced by the actuated filament. Instead of prescribing a specific functional form, we use functional optimisation and adjoint-based variational calculus to formally establish the link between the distribution of bending rigidity and propulsion. The optimal rigidities are found to be stiff near the base, and soft near the distal end, with a spatial distribution that depends critically on the constraints used in the optimisation procedure. These findings may guide the optimal design of future artificial swimmers.</description>

      <title>Anomalous interference drives oscillatory dynamics in wave-dressed active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent surge of discoveries has sparked significant interest in active systems where a particle moves autonomously due to a resonant interaction with its self-generated wave field, leading to notable wave-mediated effects including new propulsion mechanisms, spontaneous oscillatory dynamics, and quantum-like phenomena. Drawing from an archetypical model of wave-dressed active particles, we unveil a wave-mediated non-local force driving their dynamics, arising from the particle's path memory and an unconventional form of wave interference near jerking points, locations where the particle's velocity changes rapidly. In contrast to the typical case of constructive interference at points of stationary phase, waves excited by the particle near jerking points avoid cancellation through rapid changes in frequency. Through an asymptotic analysis, we derive the wave force from jerking points, revealing it as an elusive but crucial remnant of the particle's past motion that allows us to rationalize mechanistically in-line speed oscillations, wave-like statistics in potential wells, and non-specular reflections. The results we derive follow from generic wave superposition principles, suggesting their applicability to a broad class of wave-dressed active particles.</description>

      <title>Imbibition of Oil in Dry and Prewetted Calcite Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid imbibition into porous media featuring nanopores is ubiquitous in applications such as oil recovery from unconventional reservoirs and material processing. While the imbibition of pure fluids has been extensively studied, the imbibition of fluid mixture is little explored. Here we report the molecular dynamics study of the imbibition of model crude oil into nanometer-wide mineral pores, both when pore walls are dry and prewetted by a residual water film. Results show the fastest imbibition and quickest propagation of molecularly thin precursor films ahead of the oil meniscus in the dry pore system. The presence of a thin water film on pore walls corresponding to an environmental relative humidity of 30% slows down but still allows the spontaneous imbibition of single-component oil. Introducing polar components into the oil slows down the imbibition into dry nanopores, due partly to the clogging of the pore entrance. Strong selectivity toward nonpolar oil is evident. The slowdown of imbibition by polar oil is less significant in the prewetted pores than in dry pores, but the selectivity toward nonpolar oil remains strong.</description>

      <title>Universality of $SU(\infty)$ relaxation dynamics for $SU(n_f)$-symmetric spin-models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-models, where the $N$ spins interact pairwise with a $SU(n_f)$ symmetry preserving hamiltonian, famously simplify in the large $n_f$, $N$ limits, as derived by Sachdev and Ye when exploring mean-field behavior of spin-glasses. We present numerical evidence that for a large class of models, the large $n_f$ limit is not necessary: the same dynamical equations can describe the relaxation processes at high temperatures for a set of classical models inspired from mean-field treatments of interacting dense neutrino gases, up to times set by the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the correlation function. After a simple rescaling of time, the dynamics display a surprising universality, being identical for any value of $n_f$ as long as the rank of the coupling matrix is small. As a corollary of our results, we find that the direct interaction approximation originating from the study of stochastic flows in fluid turbulence should be thought of as only a short-time approximation for generic random coupling systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic laboratory X-ray phase-contrast microtomography with structure-based prior regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray microtomography is a versatile tool allowing the measurement of the 3D structure of optically thick samples. As a non-destructive technique, it is readily adapted to 4D imaging, where a sample can be monitored over time, and especially in conjunction with the application of external stimuli. To apply this technique with the limited X-ray flux available at a conventional laboratory source, we leverage the contrast enhancement of free-space propagation phase-contrast imaging, achieving an increase in contrast-to-noise ratio of 5.8x. Furthermore, we combine this with iterative reconstruction, using regularisation by a structure-based prior from a high-quality reference scan of the object. This combination of phase-contrast imaging and iterative reconstruction leads to a 29.2x improvement in contrast-to-noise ratio compared to the conventional reconstruction. This enables fully dynamic X-ray microtomography, with a temporal resolution of 9 s at a voxel size of 10.5 $\mu$m. We use this to measure the movement of a waterfront in the fine vessels of a wooden skewer, as a representative example of dynamic system evolving on the scale of tens of seconds.</description>

      <title>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the liquid-vapor interface. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on a quasi-continuum approach. Experimental evidence for this effect has been scarce so far. Here, we examine evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates, including the liquid films on both sides, by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Our solution shows that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, i.e., the evaporative refrigeration effect. Our work not only re-affirms the refrigeration effect, but clarifies that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. At the interface, the asymmetry in the distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules creates a cooling effect, which is the dominant mechanism. Additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. Our work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning and refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Enhancement and Suppression of Active Particle Movement Due to Membrane Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microswimmers and active colloids often move in confined systems, including those involving interfaces. Such interfaces, especially at the microscale, may deform in response to the stresses of the flow created by the active particle. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of a nearby membrane due to the motion of an active particle whose flow fields are generated by force-free singularities. We demonstrate our result on a particle represented by a combination of a force dipole and a source dipole, while the membrane resists deformation due to tension and bending rigidity. We find that the deformation either enhances or suppresses the motion of the active particle, depending on its orientation and the relative strengths between the fundamental singularities that describe its flow. Furthermore, the deformation can generate motion in new directions.</description>

      <title>Preliminary experimental investigation on the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow experimentally using optical diagnostics in the Reynolds and Froude parameter space ($7.7{\times}10^3&lt;Re&lt;3.8{\times}10^4$, $0.1&lt;Fr&lt;0.4$). Interactions between the turbulent flow and the granular structure give rise to transient erosion-deposition dynamics leading to various types of particle transport. The subaqueous structures in the channel bed evolves due to shear-stress-induced erosion, gravity-driven deposition, and subsequent particle transport. We study the centroid motion and the granular structure shape evolution. At lower end of our $Re-Fr$ parameter space, we observe no erosion and the structure remains at rest. At intermediate values of $Re$ and $Fr$, we observe very slow erosion and the granular structure moves vere slowly as a rigid body without significant shape deformation. Higher values of $Re$ and $Fr$ causes vortex formation at the upstream of the dune resulting in stronger erosion, rapid shape deformation and relatively higher translation velocity of the centroid.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian averaging of singular stochastic actions for fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct sub-grid scale models of incompressible fluids by considering expectations of semi-martingale Lagrangian particle trajectories. Our construction is based on the Lagrangian decomposition of flow maps into mean and fluctuation parts, and it is separated into the following steps. First, through Magnus expansion, the fluid velocity field is expressed in terms of fluctuation vector fields whose dynamics are assumed to be stochastic. Second, we use Malliavin calculus to give a regularised interpretation of the product of white noise when inserting the stochastic velocity field into the Lagrangian for Euler's fluid. Lastly, we consider closures of the mean velocity by making stochastic analogues of Talyor's frozen-in turbulence hypothesis to derive a version of the anisotropic Lagrangian averaged Euler equation.</description>

      <title>Elastic displacements in wedge-shaped geometries with a straight edge: Green's functions for perpendicular forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edges are abundant when fluids are contained in vessels or elastic solids glide in guiding rails. We here address induced small-scale flows in viscous fluids or displacements in elastic solids in the vicinity of one such edge. For this purpose, we solve the underlying low-Reynolds-number flow equations for incompressible fluids and the elasticity equations for linearly elastic, possibly compressible solids. Technically speaking, we derive the associated Green's functions under confinement by two planar boundaries that meet at a straight edge. The two boundaries both feature no-slip or free-slip conditions, or one of these two conditions per boundary. Previously, we solved the simpler case of the force being oriented parallel to the straight edge. Here, we complement this solution by the more challenging case of the force pointing into a direction perpendicular to the edge. Together, these two cases provide the general solution. Specific situations in which our analysis may find application in terms of quantitative theoretical descriptions are particle motion in confined colloidal suspensions, dynamics of active microswimmers near edges, or actuated distortions of elastic materials due to activated contained functionalized particles.</description>

      <title>Discovery of propagating trains of oscillons over Faraday waves in a 1D experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of highly localized structures traveling over a one-dimensional pattern of Faraday waves in a vertically-vibrated fluid layer confined in a thin annular cell. These propagating structures emerge spontaneously beyond a threshold and coexist with the underlying pattern. They move at constant speed, in trains of sharp peaks that co- and counter-propagate along the cell, with velocities largely exceeding the Faraday waves drift. Our results raise the question whether propagating localized structures are also observable in other parametrically driven systems in physics.</description>

      <title>Coherent Organization of Passive Scalar from a Point-Source in a Turbulent Boundary Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial organization of a passive scalar plume originating from a point source in a turbulent boundary layer is studied to understand its meandering characteristics. We focus shortly downstream of the isokinetic injection ($1.5\le x/\delta \le 3$, $\delta$ being boundary layer thickness) where the scalar concentration is highly intermittent, the plume rapidly \textit{meanders}, and \textit{breaks-up} into concentrated scalar pockets due to the action of turbulent structures. Two injection locations were considered: the center of logarithmic-region and the wake-region of the boundary layer. Simultaneous quantitative acetone planar laser-induced fluorescence (Ac-PLIF) and particle-image velocimetry (PIV) were performed in a wind-tunnel, to measure scalar mixture fraction and velocity fields. Single- and multi-point statistics were compared to established works to validate the diagnostic novelties. Additionally, the spatial characteristics of plume intermittency were quantified using `blob' size, shape, orientation and mean concentration. It was observed that straining, break up and spatial reorganization were the primary plume-evolution modes in this region, with little small-scale homogenization. Further, the dominant role of coherent vortex motions in plume meandering and break-up was evident. Their action is found to be the primary mechanism by which the injected scalar is transported away from the wall in high concentrations (`large meander events (LMEs)'). Strong spatial correlation was observed in both instantaneous and conditional fields between the high concentration regions and individual vortex heads. This coherent transport was weaker for wake-injection, where the plume only interacts with outer vortex motions. A coherent-structure based mechanism is suggested to explain these transport mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: A Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) is a collection of thunderstorms operating as a unified system, showcasing nature's untamed power. They represent a phenomenon widely referenced in both the natural sciences and the visual effects (VFX) industries.However, in computer graphics, visually accurate simulation of MCS dynamics remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity of atmospheric microphysical processes.To achieve a high level of visual quality while ensuring practical performance, we introduce Thunderscapes, the first physically based simulation framework for visually realistic MCS tailored to graphical applications.Our model integrates mesoscale cloud microphysics with hydrometeor electrification processes to simulate thunderstorm development and lightning flashes. By capturing various thunderstorm types and their associated lightning activities, Thunderscapes demonstrates the versatility and physical accuracy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven RANS Closures Using a Relative Importance Term Analysis Based Classifier for 2D and 3D Separated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for enhancing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling through the application of a Relative Importance Term Analysis (RITA) methodology to develop a new zonally-augmented $k-\omega$ SST model. Traditional Linear Eddy Viscosity Models often struggle with separated flows. Our approach introduces a physics-based binary classifier that systematically identifies separated shear layers requiring correction by analyzing the relative magnitudes of terms in the turbulence kinetic energy equation. Using symbolic regression, we develop compact correction terms for Reynolds stress anisotropy and turbulent kinetic energy production. Trained on two-dimensional configurations, our model demonstrates significant improvements in predicting separation dynamics while maintaining baseline performance and fully attached flows. Generalization tests on Ahmed body and Faith Hill three-dimensional configurations confirm robust transferability, establishing an effective methodology for targeted enhancement of RANS predictions in separated flows.</description>

      <title>Efficient cell-centered nodal integral method for multi-dimensional Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient coarse-mesh nodal integral method (NIM), based on cell-centered variables and termed the cell-centered NIM (CCNIM), is developed and applied to solve multi-dimensional, time-dependent, nonlinear Burgers equations, extending the applicability of CCNIM to nonlinear problems. To overcome the existing limitation of CCNIM to linear problems, the convective velocity in the nonlinear convection term is approximated using two different approaches, both demonstrating accuracy comparable to or better than traditional NIM for nonlinear Burgers problems. Unlike traditional NIM, which utilizes surface-averaged variables as discrete unknowns, this innovative approach formulates the final expression of the numerical scheme using discrete unknowns represented by cell-centered (or node-averaged) variables. Using these cell centroids, the proposed CCNIM approach presents several advantages compared to traditional NIM. These include a simplified implementation process in terms of local coordinate systems, enhanced flexibility regarding the higher order of accuracy in time, straightforward formulation for higher-degree temporal derivatives, and offering a viable option for coupling with other physics. The multi-dimensional time-dependent Burgers problems (propagating shock, propagation, and diffusion of an initial sinusoidal wave, shock-like formation) with known analytical solutions are solved in order to validate the developed scheme. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the proposed CCNIM approach and other traditional NIM schemes is conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed approach has shown quadratic convergence in both space and time, i.e., O[$(\Delta x)^2, (\Delta t)^2$], for the considered test problems. The simplicity and robustness of the approach provide a strong foundation for its seamless extension to more complex fluid flow problems.</description>

      <title>Geodesic vortex detection on curved surfaces: Analyzing the 2002 austral stratospheric polar vortex warming event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geodesic vortex detection is a tool in nonlinear dynamical systems to objectively identify transient vortices with flow-invariant boundaries that defy the typical deformation found in 2-d turbulence. Initially formulated for flows on the Euclidean plane with Cartesian coordinates, we have extended this technique to flows on 2-d Riemannian manifolds with arbitrary coordinates. This extension required the further formulation of the concept of objectivity on manifolds. Moreover, a recently proposed birth-and-death vortex framing algorithm, based on geodesic detection, has been adapted to address the limited temporal validity of 2-d motion in otherwise 3-d flows, like those found in the Earth's stratosphere. With these adaptations, we focused on the Lagrangian, i.e., kinematic, aspects of the austral stratospheric polar vortex during the exceptional sudden warming event of 2002, which resulted in the vortex splitting. This study involved applying geodesic vortex detection to isentropic winds from reanalysis data. We provide a detailed analysis of the vortex's life cycle, covering its birth, the splitting process, and its eventual death. In addition, we offer new kinematic insights into ozone depletion within the vortex.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Optimization for the Evolve-Filter-Relax regularization of convection-dominated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical stabilization techniques are often employed in under-resolved simulations of convection-dominated flows to improve accuracy and mitigate spurious oscillations. Specifically, the evolve--filter--relax (EFR) algorithm is a framework which consists in evolving the solution, applying a filtering step to remove high-frequency noise, and relaxing through a convex combination of filtered and original solutions. The stability and accuracy of the EFR solution strongly depend on two parameters, the filter radius $\delta$ and the relaxation parameter $\chi$. Standard choices for these parameters are usually fixed in time, and related to the full order model setting, i.e., the grid size for $\delta$ and the time step for $\chi$. The key novelties with respect to the standard EFR approach are: (i) time-dependent parameters $\delta(t)$ and $\chi(t)$, and (ii) data-driven adaptive optimization of the parameters in time, considering a fully-resolved simulation as reference. In particular, we propose three different classes of optimized-EFR (Opt-EFR) strategies, aiming to optimize one or both parameters. The new Opt-EFR strategies are tested in the under-resolved simulation of a turbulent flow past a cylinder at $Re=1000$. The Opt-EFR proved to be more accurate than standard approaches by up to 99$\%$, while maintaining a similar computational time. In particular, the key new finding of our analysis is that such accuracy can be obtained only if the optimized objective function includes: (i) a global metric (as the kinetic energy), and (ii) spatial gradients' information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft valves serve to modulate and rectify flows in complex vasculatures across the tree of life, e.g. in the heart of every human reading this. Here we consider a minimal physical model of the heart mitral valve modeled as a flexible conical shell capable of flow rectification via collapse and coaptation in an impinging (reverse) flow. Our experiments show that the complex elastohydrodynamics of closure features a noise-activated rectification mechanism. A minimal theoretical model allows us to rationalize our observations while illuminating a dynamical bifurcation driven by stochastic hydrodynamic forces. Our theory also suggests a way to trigger the coaptation of soft valves on demand, which we corroborate using experiments, suggesting a design principle for their efficient operation.</description>
