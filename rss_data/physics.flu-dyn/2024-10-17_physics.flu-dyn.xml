      <title>Modal analysis of blood flows in saccular aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, it is challenging to investigate aneurismal hemodynamics based on current in-vivo data such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography due to the limitations in both spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work, we investigate the use of modal analysis at various resolutions to examine its usefulness for analyzing blood flows in brain aneurysms. Two variants of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD): (i) Hankel-DMD; and (ii) Optimized-DMD, are used to extract the time-dependent dynamics of blood flows during one cardiac cycle. First, high-resolution hemodynamic data in patient-specific aneurysms are obtained using Computational Fluid Dynamics. Second, the dynamics modes, along with their spatial amplitudes and temporal magnitudes are calculated using the DMD analysis. Third, an examination of DMD analyses using a range of spatial and temporal resolutions of hemodynamic data to validate the applicability of DMD for low-resolution data, similar to ones in clinical practices. Our results show that DMD is able to characterize the inflow jet dynamics by separating large-scale structures and flow instabilities even at low spatial and temporal resolutions. Its robustness in quantifying the flow dynamics using the energy spectrum is demonstrated across different resolutions in all aneurysms in our study population. Our work indicates that DMD can be used for analyzing blood flow patterns of brain aneurysms and is a promising tool to be explored in in-vivo.</description>

      <title>Early turbulence in viscoelastic flow past a periodic cylinder array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early turbulence in periodic cylinder arrays is of particular interest in many practical applications to enhance mixing and material/heat exchange. In this study, we reveal a new early transition pathway to a chaotic wavy state and drag enhancement with the addition of polymers. Using 2D direct numerical simulations with sufficiently small polymer diffusion ($\epsilon=10^{-5}$), we show that viscoelastic flow past periodic cylinder arrays become unstable at a Reynolds number $Re\approx 10$, significantly lower than the Newtonian counterpart of $Re\approx 150-200$. The chaotic wavy state which ensues exhibits sheets and `arrowhead' polymer conformation structures, consistent with the saturated centre-mode instability observed in wall-bounded parallel flows (Page et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 125, 154501, 2020). Analysis of the kinetic energy budget reveals the purely elastic origin of the chaos. However, inertial forces, in conjunction with elastic forces, can reshape the base state, affecting the formation of an invariant polymer sheet. This sheet facilitates the stretching and recoiling of polymers, which in turn induces flow fluctuations and maintains the chaos. Exploring various maximum polymer extensions $b$, and polymer concentrations $\beta$ highlights the role of elastic forces in stretching the upstream separation zone while suppressing the downstream separation zone, resulting in drag enhancement at finite $Re$. Surprisingly, these modifications to the base state can suppress the invariant polymer sheet under large elastic forces (large $b$ or small $\beta$), thereby achieving a stable polymer-modified laminar state.</description>

      <title>Fluid Dynamics and Passive Scalar Transport Driven by Non-Uniform Tumbling of a Prolate Spheroid in Simple Shear Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-fidelity numerical simulations based on a lattice Boltzmann framework, the advection-enhanced transport of a passive scalar from a prolate spheroid in simple shear flow has been thoroughly investigated across various parameters, including the spheroid's aspect ratio, particle-to-fluid density ratio, Reynolds number, and Schmidt number. The Reynolds number is constrained to the range from 0 to 1, where the prolate spheroid tumbles around its minor axis, aligned with the vorticity axis, in an equilibrium state. Several key findings have emerged: 1) Particle inertia significantly influences the uniformity of the spheroid's tumbling, affecting flow patterns around the spheroid and, consequently, the modes of scalar transport; 2) Both uniform and non-uniform tumbling generate a scalar line in the fluid with elevated scalar concentration, which sweeps through the wake region and merges with clusters of previously formed scalar lines; 3) Fluid passing over the spheroid carries the passive scalar downstream along these scalar lines; 4) Variations in the uniformity of spheroid tumbling result in distinct flow patterns and scalar transport modes, leading to different transport rates; 5) Within the studied parameter ranges, increased particle inertia enhances the scalar transport rate; 6) When both fluid and particle inertia are minimal, the dimensionless scalar transport rate for different aspect ratios converges to a common dependence on the Peclet number. These phenomena are analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>Enhancing machine learning turbulence models via prediction of tensor basis normalized coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12255v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, their application in developing turbulence models has become increasingly prevalent. Numerous machine learning turbulence models have recently been founded on Pope's general eddy-effective hypothesis. However, most of these models directly predict the non-dimensional Reynolds deviatoric tensor, treating tensor basis coefficients as intermediate variables. This approach presents three primary drawbacks. Firstly, it conflates the training error of the machine learning regression algorithm with the modeling error inherent in Pope's general eddy-effective hypothesis. Secondly, by treating tensor basis coefficients as intermediary values, researchers often overlook their significance and physical interpretation, particularly in black-box models such as neural networks. Thirdly, this method introduces numerical interdependence among tensor basis coefficients, violating the orthogonality of the tensor basis. Yin et al. (2022) proposed a neural network-based turbulence model that utilizes tensor basis coefficients as prediction labels. However, their framework employs a regularization method with numerous hyperparameters to achieve convergence and smooth results by leveraging information from the linear-eddy viscosity hypothesis. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and realizability of machine learning turbulence models by predicting tensor basis normalized coefficients. This method's fundamental principle is the normalization and bounding of prediction labels for machine learning algorithms. Utilizing periodic hills direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for training and testing, we demonstrate that our innovative method improves accuracy and realizability in neural network-based and symbolic regression-based turbulence models.</description>

      <title>On the parameters of common settling velocity models for porous sediment aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The settling behavior of sediment aggregates is a critical factor influencing the transport of fine-grained sediments in riverine and marine environments. Due to the small size and fragile structure of cohesive sediment aggregates, direct measurement of their porosity and permeability is challenging. While porosity is often estimated using settling velocity relations, permeability is frequently overlooked. This study examines the impact of considering non-negligible permeability on the properties of flocs. We compare aggregate properties by calibrating experimental data to two settling models in a dilute regime: one assumes a fractal structure of aggregates and neglects permeability, while the other assumes constant porosity and permeability. Our results demonstrate that both models describe the experimental data of highly porous aggregates with similar accuracy. We further investigate aggregate dynamics in more complex flow conditions using numerical simulations employing a volume penalization method to geometrically resolve flocs. We compare the behavior of permeable and impermeable flocs in dense suspension regimes and during dilute settling in density-stratified environments. Our findings reveal that permeability significantly influences settling dynamics in complex scenarios and should be considered when determining aggregate properties.</description>

      <title>Multi-Particle Dispersion in Rotating-Stratified Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of matter by turbulent flows plays an important role, in particular in a geophysical context. Here, we study the relative movement of groups of two (pairs) and four (tetrahedra) Lagrangian particles using direct numerical simulations of the stably-stratified Boussinsesq equations, with Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency $N$ and Coriolis parameter $f$. We cover regimes close to homogeneous isotropic turbulence, to flows dominated by stratification and rotation, keeping fixed the ratio $N/f = 5$. The flows studied are anisotropic, so the relative motion between two particles depends not only on the initial separation between the particles, but also on their orientation with respect to the vertical axis. In all cases considered, we demonstrate that the relative particle motion differs depending on whether dispersion is considered forward or backwards in time, although the asymmetry becomes less pronounced when stratification and rotation increase. On the other hand, the strong fluctuations in the dispersion between two particles become more extreme when $N$ and $f$ increase. We also find evidence for the formation of shear layers, which become more pronounced as $N$ and $f$ become larger. Finally, we show that the irreversibility on the dispersion of a set of particles forming initially a regular tetrahedron becomes weaker when the influence of stratification and rotation increase, a property that we relate to that of the perceived rate-of-strain tensor.</description>

      <title>Measuring time-resolved heat transfer fluctuations on a heated-thin foil in a turbulent channel airflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental setup to perform time-resolved convective heat transfer measurements in a turbulent channel flow with air as the working fluid. We employ a heated thin foil coupled with high-speed infrared thermography. The measurement technique is challenged by the thermal inertia of the foil, the high frequency of turbulent fluctuations, and the measurement noise of the infrared camera. We discuss in detail the advantages and drawbacks of all the design choices that were made, thereby providing a successful implementation strategy to obtain high-quality data. This experimental approach could be useful for experimental studies employing wall-based measurements of turbulence, such as flow control applications in wall-bounded turbulence.</description>

      <title>Dynamical signature of vortex mass in Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum vortices are commonly described as funnel-like objects around which the superfluid swirls, and their motion is typically modeled in terms of massless particles. Here, we show that, in Fermi superfluids, the normal component confined in the vortex core provides the vortex with a finite inertial mass. This inertia imparts an unambiguous signature to the dynamic behavior of vortices, specifically manifesting as small-amplitude transverse oscillations which remarkably follow the prediction of a simple point-like model supplemented by an effective mass. We demonstrate this phenomenon through large-scale time-dependent simulations of Fermi superfluids across a wide range of interaction parameters, at both zero and finite temperatures, and for various initial conditions. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of inertial effects in superfluid vortex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Convection Speeds Up the Charging of Porous Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the charging of a single electrolyte-filled pore using the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations. We find that electroconvection, previously ignored in this context, can substantially speed up the charging dynamics. We derive an analytical model that describes the induced fluid velocity and the electric current arising due to convection. Our findings suggest that convection becomes significant beyond a certain threshold voltage that is an inherent electrolyte property.</description>

      <title>On the self-similarity of unbounded viscous Marangoni flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marangoni flow induced by an insoluble surfactant on a fluid-fluid interface is a fundamental problem investigated extensively due to its implications in colloid science, biology, the environment, and industrial applications. Here, we study the limit of a deep liquid subphase with negligible inertia (low Reynolds number, $Re\ll{1}$), where the two-dimensional problem has been shown to be described by the complex Burgers equation. We analyze the problem through a self-similar formulation, providing further insights into its structure and revealing its universal features. Six different similarity solutions are found. One of the solutions includes surfactant diffusion, whereas the other five, which are identified through a phase-plane formalism, hold only in the limit of negligible diffusion (high surface P\'eclet number $Pe_s\gg{1}$). Surfactant 'pulses', with a locally higher concentration that spreads outward, lead to two similarity solutions of the first kind with a similarity exponent $\beta=1/2$. On the other hand, distributions that are locally depleted and flow inwards lead to similarity of the second kind, with two different exponents that we obtain exactly using stability arguments. We distinguish between 'dimple' solutions, where the surfactant has a quadratic minimum and $\beta=2$, from 'hole' solutions, where the concentration profile is flatter than quadratic and $\beta=3/2$. Each of these two cases exhibits two similarity solutions, one earlier than a critical time $t_*$ when the derivative of the concentration is singular, and another one valid after $t_*$. We obtain all six solutions in closed form, and discuss predictions that can be extracted from these results.</description>

      <title>Towards aerodynamic surrogate modeling based on $\beta$-variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models that combine dimensionality reduction and regression techniques are essential to reduce the need for costly high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics data. New approaches using $\beta$-Variational Autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) architectures have shown promise in obtaining high-quality low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional flow data while enabling physical interpretation of their latent spaces. We propose a surrogate model based on latent space regression to predict pressure distributions on a transonic wing given the flight conditions: Mach number and angle of attack. The $\beta$-VAE model, enhanced with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), maps high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional latent space, showing a direct correlation with flight conditions. Regularization through $\beta$ requires careful tuning to improve overall performance, while PCA preprocessing helps to construct an effective latent space, improving autoencoder training and performance. Gaussian Process Regression is used to predict latent space variables from flight conditions, showing robust behavior independent of $\beta$, and the decoder reconstructs the high-dimensional pressure field data. This pipeline provides insight into unexplored flight conditions. Furthermore, a fine-tuning process of the decoder further refines the model, reducing the dependence on $\beta$ and enhancing accuracy. Structured latent space, robust regression performance, and significant improvements in fine-tuning collectively create a highly accurate and efficient surrogate model. Our methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of $\beta$-VAEs for aerodynamic surrogate modeling, offering a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable alternative for aerodynamic data prediction.</description>
