      <title>Near-Driven Autonomous Rover Navigation in Complex Environments: Extensions to Urban Search-and-Rescue and Industrial Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of an extended neuroevolutionary approach, based on NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), for autonomous robots in dynamic environments associated with hazardous tasks like firefighting, urban search-and-rescue (USAR), and industrial inspections. Building on previous research, it expands the simulation environment to larger and more complex settings, demonstrating NEAT's adaptability across different applications. By integrating recent advancements in NEAT and reinforcement learning, the study uses modern simulation frameworks for realism and hybrid algorithms for optimization. Experimental results show that NEAT-evolved controllers achieve success rates comparable to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, with superior structural adaptability. The agents reached ~80% success in outdoor tests, surpassing baseline models. The paper also highlights the benefits of transfer learning among tasks and evaluates the effectiveness of NEAT in complex 3D navigation. Contributions include evaluating NEAT for diverse autonomous applications and discussing real-world deployment considerations, emphasizing the approach's potential as an alternative or complement to deep reinforcement learning in autonomous navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>Subfunction Structure Matters: A New Perspective on Local Optima Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local optima networks (LONs) capture fitness landscape information. They are typically constructed in a black-box manner; information about the problem structure is not utilised. This also applies to the analysis of LONs: knowledge about the problem, such as interaction between variables, is not considered. We challenge this status-quo with an alternative approach: we consider how LON analysis can be improved by incorporating subfunction-based information - this can either be known a-priori or learned during search. To this end, LONs are constructed for several benchmark pseudo-boolean problems using three approaches: firstly, the standard algorithm; a second algorithm which uses deterministic grey-box crossover; and a third algorithm which selects perturbations based on learned information about variable interactions. Metrics related to subfunction changes in a LON are proposed and compared with metrics from previous literature which capture other aspects of a LON. Incorporating problem structure in LON construction and analysing it can bring enriched insight into optimisation dynamics. Such information may be crucial to understanding the difficulty of solving a given problem with state-of-the-art linkage learning optimisers. In light of the results, we suggest incorporation of problem structure as an alternative paradigm in landscape analysis for problems with known or suspected subfunction structure.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Optimization Algorithms for Global Placement via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are widely employed to tackle complex problems, but designing them manually is often labor-intensive and requires significant expertise. Global placement is a fundamental step in electronic design automation (EDA). While analytical approaches represent the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in global placement, their core optimization algorithms remain heavily dependent on heuristics and customized components, such as initialization strategies, preconditioning methods, and line search techniques. This paper presents an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLM) to evolve optimization algorithms for global placement. We first generate diverse candidate algorithms using LLM through carefully crafted prompts. Then we introduce an LLM-based genetic flow to evolve selected candidate algorithms. The discovered optimization algorithms exhibit substantial performance improvements across many benchmarks. Specifically, Our design-case-specific discovered algorithms achieve average HPWL improvements of \textbf{5.05\%}, \text{5.29\%} and \textbf{8.30\%} on MMS, ISPD2005 and ISPD2019 benchmarks, and up to \textbf{17\%} improvements on individual cases. Additionally, the discovered algorithms demonstrate good generalization ability and are complementary to existing parameter-tuning methods.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Logic -- Based Scheduling System for Part-Time Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of genetic fuzzy systems to efficiently generate schedules for a team of part-time student workers at a university. Given the preferred number of working hours and availability of employees, our model generates feasible solutions considering various factors, such as maximum weekly hours, required number of workers on duty, and the preferred number of working hours. The algorithm is trained and tested with availability data collected from students at the University of Cincinnati. The results demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency in producing schedules that meet operational criteria and its robustness in understaffed conditions.</description>

      <title>Evolution Meets Diffusion: Efficient Neural Architecture Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17827v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Switch-Based Multi-Part Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces decentralized and modular neural network framework designed to enhance the scalability, interpretability, and performance of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. At the heart of this framework is a dynamic switch mechanism that governs the selective activation and training of individual neurons based on input characteristics, allowing neurons to specialize in distinct segments of the data domain. This approach enables neurons to learn from disjoint subsets of data, mimicking biological brain function by promoting task specialization and improving the interpretability of neural network behavior. Furthermore, the paper explores the application of federated learning and decentralized training for real-world AI deployments, particularly in edge computing and distributed environments. By simulating localized training on non-overlapping data subsets, we demonstrate how modular networks can be efficiently trained and evaluated. The proposed framework also addresses scalability, enabling AI systems to handle large datasets and distributed processing while preserving model transparency and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the potential of this approach in advancing the design of scalable, privacy-preserving, and efficient AI systems for diverse applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-factor learning rules in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a crucial extension to traditional Hebbian learning and Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), incorporating neuromodulatory signals to improve adaptation and learning efficiency. These mechanisms enhance biological plausibility and facilitate improved credit assignment in artificial neural systems. This paper takes a view on this topic from a machine learning perspective, providing an overview of recent advances in three-factor learning, discusses theoretical foundations, algorithmic implementations, and their relevance to reinforcement learning and neuromorphic computing. In addition, we explore interdisciplinary approaches, scalability challenges, and potential applications in robotics, cognitive modeling, and AI systems. Finally, we highlight key research gaps and propose future directions for bridging the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Activation degree thresholds and expressiveness of polynomial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.</description>

      <title>CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</description>
