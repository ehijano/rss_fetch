      <title>The Hydraulic Brain: Understanding as Constraint-Release Phase Transition in Whole-Body Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current models treat physiological signals as noise corrupting neural computation. Previously, we showed that removing these "artifacts" eliminates 70% of predictive correlation, suggesting body signals functionally drive cognition. Here, we investigate the mechanism using high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500+ trials) during P300 target recognition.
  Phase Slope Index revealed zero-lag synchrony (PSI=0.000044, p=0.061) with high coherence (0.316, p&lt;0.0001). Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs.
  Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics.
  Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration. This architecture may fundamentally distinguish biological from artificial intelligence.

      <title>Brain-MGF: Multimodal Graph Fusion Network for EEG-fMRI Brain Connectivity Analysis Under Psilocybin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychedelics, such as psilocybin, reorganise large-scale brain connectivity, yet how these changes are reflected across electrophysiological (electroencephalogram, EEG) and haemodynamic (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) networks remains unclear. We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.</description>

      <title>Decoding the science behind antioxidant -antiinflammatory nutraceuticals in stroke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with ischemic strokes accounting for nearly 80% of cases. Fewer than 5% of patients receive the sole validated pharmacotherapy, intravenous thrombolysis, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. Within this landscape, the exploration of natural molecules emerges as a promising avenue, particularly as a means to address limitations associated with conventional drugs. Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, offer a compelling prospect for health and wellness. The term nutraceutical reflects their dual potential in nutrition and pharmacotherapy, emphasizing their relevance to both disease prevention and treatment. Interestingly, many were initially recognized as ''natural preconditioners'', substances that prime the body for protection against stress or damage. In fact, numerous nutraceuticals have been shown to activate protective pathways similar to those triggered by preconditioning across various organs. Among nutraceuticals, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sourced from plants or fish, along with polyphenols, have emerged as particularly promising. Their consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on cellular components within the neurovascular unit. This review explores the shared protective mechanisms of various nutraceuticals against key drivers of ischemic injury, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. By delineating these actions, the review highlights the potential of nutraceuticals as brain preconditioners that enhance neuroprotection, thereby mitigating the impact of cerebral ischemia in both preventive and therapeutic contexts.</description>

      <title>MultiDiffNet: A Multi-Objective Diffusion Framework for Generalizable Brain Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) remains fundamentally limited by poor generalization to unseen subjects, driven by high inter-subject variability and the lack of large-scale datasets to model it effectively. Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings. Our work provides a reproducible and open-source foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding in real-world BCI systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Core-Periphery Constrained Transformer for Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn transferable representation across domains. Recently a few UDA works have successfully applied Transformer-based methods and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. However, it remains challenging when there exists a large domain gap between the source and target domain. Inspired by humans' exceptional transferability abilities to adapt knowledge from familiar to uncharted domains, we try to apply the universally existing organizational structure in the human functional brain networks, i.e., the core-periphery principle to design the Transformer and improve its UDA performance. In this paper, we propose a novel brain-inspired robust core-periphery constrained transformer (RCCT) for unsupervised domain adaptation, which brings a large margin of performance improvement on various datasets. Specifically, in RCCT, the self-attention operation across image patches is rescheduled by an adaptively learned weighted graph with the Core-Periphery structure (CP graph), where the information communication and exchange between images patches are manipulated and controlled by the connection strength, i.e., edge weight of the learned weighted CP graph. Besides, since the data in domain adaptation tasks can be noisy, to improve the model robustness, we intentionally add perturbations to the patches in the latent space to ensure generating robust learned weighted core-periphery graphs. Extensive evaluations are conducted on several widely tested UDA benchmarks. Our proposed RCCT consistently performs best compared to existing works, including 88.3\% on Office-Home, 95.0\% on Office-31, 90.7\% on VisDA-2017, and 46.0\% on DomainNet.</description>

      <title>Perceptogram: Reconstructing Visual Percepts and Presumptive Electrode Preference from EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual neural decoding from EEG has improved significantly due to diffusion models that can reconstruct high-quality images from decoded latents. While recent works have focused on relatively complex architectures to achieve good reconstruction performance from EEG, less attention has been paid to the source of this information. We present a unified framework that not only enables image reconstruction from EEG using a simple linear decoder, but also isolates interpretable EEG feature maps that support visual perception. Unlike prior approaches that rely on deep, opaque models, our method leverages the inherent structure of CLIP embeddings to keep the mapping linear. We show that training a simple linear decoder from EEG to CLIP latent space, followed by a frozen pre-trained diffusion model, is sufficient to decode images with state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Beyond reconstruction, Perceptogram enables the visualization of presumptive electrode preference and EEG patterns, revealing interpretable EEG feature maps that correspond to distinct visual attributes, such as semantic class, texture, and hue. We thus use our framework, Perceptogram, to probe EEG signals at various levels of the visual information hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Why Consciousness Should Explain Physical Phenomena: Toward a Testable Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.</description>

      <title>Inferring response times of perceptual decisions with Poisson variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Functional Classification of Spiking Signal Data Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays. Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.</description>
