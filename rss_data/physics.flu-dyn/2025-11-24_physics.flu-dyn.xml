      <title>Behind the logarithmic growth of inner-scaled wall-pressure variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-Reynolds-number zero-pressure-gradient turbulent channel flow, the inner-scaled wall-pressure variance follows a logarithmic increase with frictional Reynolds number of the form $\langle p_w^{+2}\rangle = B_{\mathcal{L}} + A_{\mathcal{Q}} \ln \delta^+$.
  We consider the two sources of the pressure Poisson equation: a linear (i.e., rapid) term linked to mean shear and a nonlinear (i.e., slow) term from quadratic velocity fluctuations. The goal of this paper is to provide a mechanistic link between the sources of the pressure Poisson equation and the coefficients in the inner-scaled variance form above. We tie the offset $B_{\mathcal{L}}$ to the linear source and connect the coefficient $A_{\mathcal{Q}}$ to the nonlinear source. The illustrative dataset is direct numerical simulation (DNS) at $\delta^+\approx 550$, although the principal contribution is the establishment of a mechanistic link that allows us to connect well-known high-$\delta^+$ scalings of wall-bounded turbulence.
  Through consideration of the spectral content of the sources and the integral solution method of the Poisson equation, we find that the linear source contribution sits predominantly in the buffer layer and maps to the near-wall cycle. This contribution becomes $\delta^+$ invariant under inner scaling, thus contributing the offset $B_{\mathcal{L}}$.
  The interfacial region between uniform momentum zones starting in the log layer (fissures) concentrates strain and vorticity contributions in the log layer and contains an increasingly large proportion of the strain and vorticity. We show that fissures act as a compact carrier for the source terms, with the nonlinear term especially prominent in this region. Then, by considering the inertial layer statistics, we tie the changing nonlinear contribution to $A_{\mathcal{Q}}$.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian constitutive model selection for high-strain-rate soft material characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-fidelity characterization of soft, tissue-like materials under ultra-high-strain-rate conditions is critical in engineering and medicine. Still, it remains challenging due to limited optical access, sensitivity to initial conditions, and experimental variability. Microcavitation techniques (e.g., laser-induced microcavitation) have emerged as a viable method for determining the mechanical properties of soft materials in the ultra-high-strain-rate regime (higher than 10^3 s^{-1}); however, they are limited by measurement noise and uncertainty in parameter estimation. A hierarchical Bayesian model selection method is employed using the Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry (IMR) technique to address these limitations. With this method, the parameter space of different constitutive models is explored to determine the most credible constitutive model that describes laser-induced microcavitation bubble oscillations in soft, viscoelastic, transparent hydrogels. The target data/evidence is computed using a weighted Gaussian likelihood with a hierarchical noise scale, which enables the quantification of uncertainty in model plausibility. Physically informed priors, including range-invariant, stress-based parameter priors, a model-redundancy prior, and a Bayesian Information Criterion motivated model prior, penalize complex models to enforce Occam's razor. Using a precomputed grid of simulations, the probabilistic model selection process enables an initial guess for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) material parameter values. Synthetic tests recover the ground-truth models and expected parameters. Using experimental data for gelatin, fibrin, polyacrylamide, and agarose, MAP simulations of credible models reproduce the data. Moreover, a cross-institutional comparison of 10% gelatin indicates consistent constitutive model selection.</description>

      <title>Humidity lightens the air but hinders human evaporative cooling in arid heat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overheating poses significant threats to human health and productivity. In hot conditions, the human body primarily cools through sweat evaporation; however, we show that understanding of physical phenomena controlling the evaporation rate is surprisingly incomplete. This rate is equal to the product of the skin to air water vapor concentration difference and the flow dependent mass transfer coefficient, which, according to the Lewis heat and mass transfer analogy, is proportional to the convective heat transfer coefficient. In low wind, free convection conditions, current models for the human heat transfer coefficients consider only temperature driven air buoyancy. Here, we show that in arid heat, humidity from sweat exerts a comparable but opposing buoyant effect. Using sweating thermal manikin experiments and digital twin multiphysics simulations, we demonstrate that the dueling thermal and humidity induced buoyancy can severely suppress sweat evaporation (e.g., by over half in conditions that occur in Arizona for one-third of the year). Neglecting humidity-induced buoyancy leads to substantial errors in thermoregulation model predictions; within 2 hour exposure to typical arid heat conditions, core temperature increases by 1C more than predicted by legacy calculations. We provide compact, physics informed models for free convective heat transfer coefficients for wide temperature and humidity ranges, enabling improved thermoregulation modeling and thermal audits for more accurate heat stress assessment and optimization of extreme heat mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>A Priori Assessment of Rotational Invariance in Multiscale CNN-Based Subgrid-Scale Model for Wall-Bounded Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a rotationally invariant data-driven subgrid-scale (SGS) model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of wall-bounded turbulent flows. Building upon the multiscale convolutional neural network subgrid-scale model, which outputs SGS stress tensors ($\tau_{ij}$) as the baseline, the deep neural network (DNN) architecture is modified to satisfy the principle of material objectivity by removing the bias terms and batch normalization layers while incorporating a spatial transformer network (STN) algorithm. The model was trained on a turbulent channel flow at $\mathrm{Re}_\tau = 180$ and evaluated using both non-rotated and rotated inputs. The results show that the model performs well in predicting $\tau_{ij}$ and key turbulence statistics, including dissipation, backscatter, and SGS transport. These quantities reflect the ability of the model to reproduce the energy transfer between the resolved scale and SGS. Moreover, it effectively generalizes to unseen rotated inputs, accurately predicting $\tau_{ij}$ despite the input configurations not being encountered during the training. These findings highlight that modifying the DNN architecture and integrating the STN-based algorithm improves the ability to recognize and correctly respond to rotated inputs. The proposed data-driven SGS model addresses the key limitations of common data-driven SGS approaches, particularly their sensitivity to rotated input conditions. It also marks an important advancement in data-driven SGS modeling for LES, particularly in flow configurations where rotational effects are non-negligible.</description>

      <title>Collapse of turbulence in curved pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased friction caused by turbulence is a significant contributor to energy consumption in the fluid-transport and piping industries. Here we describe a passive approach to reduce friction: we show that a local increase in streamwise flow curvature, combined with changing the circular cross-section to an oval, relaminarizes turbulent flow in curved pipes. We exemplify this effect in a $180^\circ$ bend at $Re_D = 10\,000$ and $20\,000$, well above the linear-stability limit. Curvature inhibits streamwise Reynolds stresses, and cross-sectional modifications weaken the secondary flow, together disrupting the near-wall regeneration cycle and collapsing turbulence. Simulations and experiments confirm that these geometric modifications suppress turbulence and reduce pressure loss by 53% and 36% compared with the baseline $180^\circ$ bend and an equal-length fully developed straight pipe, respectively. The results establish a passive, mechanism-based route to relaminarization in curved pipes with implications for energy-efficient control in other wall-bounded flows with curvature.</description>

      <title>Transport and removal of a passive tracer in porous media employing surface washing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This experimental study investigates the dynamics of surface washing to remove a passive tracer from a porous plate by a gravity-driven liquid film across its surface. A disodium fluorescein tracer is introduced at the surface of a water-saturated porous plate and allowed to diffuse into the plate for a number of hours before a film of water solution flows over its surface to extract and transport the tracer away. The removal rate of the tracer is monitored quantitatively by using fluorescence measurements to determine the concentration in the effluent from the washing process. These measurements are supplemented by dye-attenuation imaging, which provides mainly qualitative insights about the tracer's concentration distribution on the porous plate surface. Our findings reveal a three-stage mass-transport process consisting of an initial period of rapid removal of the tracer found within the surface roughness, followed by a period of slower removal, which appears to be limited by vertical diffusion, and a third stage of accelerated advection-dominated removal when the tracer-rich region that was transported downstream during the second stage reaches the downstream boundary of the porous plate. A parametric study explores the influence of the characteristics of the washing film, the permeability of the porous plate, the amount and initial spatial extent of the tracer on the porous plate and the tracer's diffusive penetration depth on the mass removal rates. Our insights offer practical guidance for optimising surface washing protocols for porous systems in industrial and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Laminar and Turbulent Flow in Wavy Pipes under Strong Wall Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate laminar and turbulent flow in pipes with periodically varying cross-sections, using direct numerical simulations over a range of Reynolds numbers between 1-5300. Pipe diameters are sinusoidally modulated in the axial direction, resulting in constrictions that reduce the local pipe radius by up to 40 percent. Such pronounced geometric roughness is encountered across disciplines, but is particularly relevant to karst systems, where dissolution-driven wall deformation leads to strong cross-sectional variability. Unlike classical roughness studies that assume small, homogeneous wall perturbations, the present configuration introduces large-scale axial variations that significantly affect flow structure, separation behaviour, and pressure drop even in the laminar regime. Once a critical roughness is exceeded, flow reversal appears at Reynolds numbers smaller than $25$, inducing local recirculation zones and significantly increasing friction. These effects are not captured by classical models based solely on bulk geometric parameters, but require the definition of an effective hydraulic radius. Furthermore, the strong wall-induced mixing promotes an early transitions to turbulence in a Reynolds range between 500 and 1000, well below the classical threshold for smooth pipes. At higher roughness, the influence of Reynolds number becomes increasingly hidden by geometric effects, as the flow is dominated by inertial separation and wall-induced disturbances. The peak-to-peak amplitude provides a robust estimator for the equivalent sandgrain roughness. These findings emphasise the limitations of traditional friction laws in geometrically complex conduits and point to the need for new models that account for the interplay between large-scale roughness and inertial effects.</description>

      <title>Addressing A Posteriori Performance Degradation in Neural Network Subgrid Stress Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network subgrid stress models often have a priori performance that is far better than the a posteriori performance, leading to neural network models that look very promising a priori completely failing in a posteriori Large Eddy Simulations (LES). This performance gap can be decreased by combining two different methods, training data augmentation and reducing input complexity to the neural network. Augmenting the training data with two different filters before training the neural networks has no performance degradation a priori as compared to a neural network trained with one filter. A posteriori, neural networks trained with two different filters are far more robust across two different LES codes with different numerical schemes. In addition, by ablating away the higher order terms input into the neural network, the a priori versus a posteriori performance changes become less apparent. When combined, neural networks that use both training data augmentation and a less complex set of inputs have a posteriori performance far more reflective of their a priori evaluation.</description>

      <title>Molecular insight on ultra-confined ionic transport in wetting films: the key role of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanofluidic transport is ubiquitous in natural systems from extra-cellular communication in biology to geological phenomena, and promotes the emergence of new technologies such as energy harvesting and water desalination. While experimental access to ultraconfined fluids has advanced rapidly, their behavior challenges conventional theoretical descriptions based on Poisson-Boltzmann theory or the Stokes equation whose possible extension remains an open question. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ionic transport within wetting films of water confined on silica surfaces down to the sub-nanometer scale. We then analyze these results using a simple one-dimensional theoretical framework. Remarkably, we show that this model remains valid even at confinement close to the molecular scale. Our results reveal that the dynamic of ion plays a key role in ionic transports, through ion adsorption at the water-silica interface. Adsorbed cations do not participate in ionic conduction, but instead generate molecular-scale roughness and transmit additional frictional forces to the substrate. This mechanism produces an apparent viscosity increase in electrostatically driven flows, reaching up to four times the bulk value in the case of potassium. Our findings highlight the critical role of interfacial ion adsorption in nanoscale hydrodynamics and provide new insights for interpreting experiments and designing nanofluidic systems.</description>

Abstract: Dripping-onto-Substrate (DoS) rheometry is a well-established method for measuring the extensional rheology of low-viscosity liquids. However, clear guidelines on the capabilities and limitations of the technique are lacking. In the present work, we define operational limits for measuring a transient extensional viscosity directly from observation of the rate of filament thinning, as well as model-based bounds on calculating a viscosity $\eta$ and extensional relaxation time $\tau_E$ of a liquid using DoS. Dilute solutions of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyacrylamide (PAM) are used to probe the lower limit of measurable $\tau_E$, demonstrating that values as low as 0.1 ms can be resolved, provided (a) the intrinsic Deborah number (based on the ratio of the relaxation time and the Rayleigh breakup time scale) is $De \geq \mathcal{O}(0.1)$ and (b) an instrumental constraint related to spatial and temporal resolution is satisfied. This instrumental constraint is quantified through a new metric we define as the \textit{filament capture rate}, a ``figure of merit'' (expressed in Hz) that can be used to quantify the number of data points within the elasto-capillary regime that are available for extraction of $\tau_E$. We also investigate the sensitivity to other experimental parameters including variations in nozzle radius and Bond number ($Bo$). Across the tested range ($0.2 &lt; Bo &lt; 0.7$), extensional relaxation times for the same fluid vary by less than $\pm16$ \%; however, experiments with low viscosity fluids at $Bo &gt; 0.5$ exhibit damped gravitational oscillations that affect early-time dynamics. Collectively, these results provide a quantitative roadmap for reliable DoS rheometry and affirm its use for measuring sub-millisecond relaxation times in weakly elastic fluids.</description>

      <title>Flamelet Connection to Turbulence Kinetic Energy Dissipation Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate $\epsilon$, from a turbulent combustion computation using either Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulation (LES), is proposed for closure with a sub-grid non-premixed flamelet model. The intentions are to avoid the creation of artificial tracking or progress variables and to relate accurately the physics of turbulent non-premixed combustion at the resolved length scales to the small-scale physics where the mixing and chemical reactions occur. The analysis addresses the relations between $\epsilon$ and the strain rate, vorticity, viscous dissipation rate, scalar gradients, scalar dissipation rate, and burning rate at the smallest turbulence length scales where diffusion-controlled burning is faster than at larger length scales and thereby dominant. The imposed strain rate and vorticity on these smallest eddies are determined from the kinetic energy dissipation rate. Thus, an $\epsilon$ value at a specific time and location determines the two mechanical constraints (vorticity and strain rate) on the inflow to the counterflow flamelet. $\epsilon$ affects the sign of the Laplacian of pressure, which must be negative to allow the existence of the counterflow. Using different flamelet models, with and without vorticity, different results for maximum flamelet temperature, integrated flamelet burning rate, and maximum flamelet scalar dissipation rate are obtained. Flamelet models that consider the centrifugal effect of vorticity produce substantial enhancements in the accuracy and completeness of information for a turbulent combustion computation. $\epsilon$ may be used as a tracking variable that connects the sub-grid flamelet model to resolved-scale RANS or LES computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description of riblets and other drag-reducing devices has long used the concept of longitudinal and transverse protrusion heights, both as a means to predict the drag reduction itself and as equivalent boundary conditions to simplify numerical simulations by transferring the effect of riblets onto a flat virtual boundary. The limitation of this idea is that it stems from a first-order approximation in the riblet-size parameter $s^+$, and as a consequence it cannot predict other than a linear dependence of drag reduction upon $s^+$; in other words, the initial slope of the drag-reduction curve. Here the concept is extended to a full asymptotic expansion using matched asymptotics, which consistently provides higher-order protrusion coefficients and higher-order equivalent boundary conditions on a virtual flat surface. While the majority of our results, though nonlinear in $s^+$, remain linear in velocity, and therefore we shall not directly address the shape of the drag-reduction curve, this procedure will also allow us to explore the way nonlinearities of the Navier-Stokes equations first enter the $s^+$-expansion, with somewhat surprising negative results.</description>

      <title>Quaternion wavefunction formulation of incompressible inviscid fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quaternion wavefunction formulation that reduces the incompressible Euler equations to a single nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equation. The velocity field emerges from a complex quaternion wavefunction $\Psi \in \mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{H}$ satisfying a constrained Gross-Pitaevskii equation, with incompressibility enforced through a holomorphic constraint on quaternion space. This formulation preserves all conservation laws through a natural Lagrangian structure and reduces the system from four coupled nonlinear equations (three velocity components plus pressure) to one quaternion field equation with an algebraic constraint. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deriving analytical solutions for three-dimensional flow past a sphere, obtaining the Newton regime drag coefficient $C_{D,\infty} = 0.44$ from pure quaternion topology (achieving $C_D = 0.488$ at Reynolds number $\text{Re} = 1000$, within $3.8\%$ of experimental measurements) and establishing topological consistency with the experimentally observed onset of vortex shedding at $\text{Re}_c = 270$ through quaternion circulation quantization. The formulation provides a new mathematical framework for inviscid fluid dynamics and suggests efficient numerical algorithms exploiting quaternion structure.</description>

Abstract: We introduce GLOBE, a new neural surrogate for homogeneous PDEs that draws inductive bias from boundary-element methods and equivariant ML. GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.
  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the "Full" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the "Scarce" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.
  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.
  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).</description>
