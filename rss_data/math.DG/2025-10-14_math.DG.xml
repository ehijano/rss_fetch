      <title>Affine-Orthogonal Manifolds and Deformation to Levi-Civita Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of affine manifolds equipped with a flat affine connection $\nabla$ and a global Riemannian metric $g$ that is diagonal in local affine coordinates. These structures are closely related to \emph{Hessian manifolds}, where the metric locally arises as the Hessian of a smooth potential. For example, the Hopf manifold $(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\setminus \{0\}) / \langle x \mapsto 2x \rangle$ with metric $g = (\sum_i x_i^2)^{-1} \sum_i dx_i^2$ admits a proper deformation of $\nabla$ into its Levi-Civita connection. By Theorem 2.3 in \cite{cocos2025}, such deformations force the Euler characteristic to vanish, providing evidence for Chern's conjecture. The geometry of these manifolds is reminiscent of the work of Yau on affine and Hessian structures \cite{cheng_yau_1986}.</description>

      <title>Lagrange-Hamilton geometry applied to a Lotka-Volterra dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to develop, via the least squares variational method, the Lagrange-Hamilton geometry (in the sense of nonlinear connections, d-torsions and Lagrangian Yang-Mills electromagnetic-like energy) produced by a Lotka-Volterra dynamical system, a simple model of the population dynamics of species competing for some common resource. From a geometrical point of view, the Jacobi stability of this system is discussed.</description>

      <title>The rolling tangent space, a forgotten vision on geodesics and parallel transport?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a submanifold $M\subset \mathbf{R}^\nu$, a curve $\gamma:I\to M$ and tangent vectors $v$ along $\gamma$, we roll the tangent space along $\gamma$. In doing so, we get an imprint of $\gamma$ on the tangent space, as well as an imprint of tangent vectors. We show that $\gamma$ is a geodesic on $M$ if and only if this trace/imprint on the (affine) tangent space is a straight line and that $v$ is a set of parallel vectors if and only if their imprint on the tangent space is constant. In other words, in the view of the imprint on the rolling tangent space, a geodesic is a straight line, parallel transport is indeed that: parallel transport, and the covariant derivative becomes the ordinary derivative.</description>

      <title>Is a complete Riemannian manifold with positively pinched Ricci curvature compact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of R. Hamilton asserts that any convex hypersurface in an Euclidian space with pinched second fundamental form must be compact. Partly inspired by this result, twenty years ago, in \cite{Ancient}, Remark 3.1 on page 650, the author formulated a problem asking if a complete Riemannian manifold with positively pinched Ricci curvature must be compact. There are several recent progresses, which are all rigidity results concerning the flat metric except the special case for the steady solitons. In this note we provide a detailed alternate proof of Hamilton's result, in view of the recent proof via the mean curvature flow requiring additional assumptions and that the original argument by Hamilton does lack of complete details. The proof uses a result of the author in 1998 concerning quasi-conformal maps. The proof here allows a generalization as well. We dedicate this article to commemorate R. Hamilton, the creator of the Ricci flow, who also made fundamental contributions to many other geometric flows.</description>

      <title>General Chen's first inequality and applications for Riemannian maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general form of Chen's first inequality (in short, CFI) for Riemannian maps between Riemannian manifolds. Further, using this general form, we obtain the CFI for Riemannian maps when target spaces are generalized complex and generalized Sasakian space forms. Consequently, we also obtain the CFI for Riemannian maps when the target spaces are real, complex, real K\"ahler, Sasakian, Kenmotsu, cosymplectic, and almost $C(\alpha)$ space forms. Moreover, we also discuss geometric applications of CFI on generalized complex and generalized Sasakian space forms. Specifically, we give estimations for $\delta$-invariants within various hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Weak immersions with second fundamental form in a critical Sobolev space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the analysis of Lipschitz immersions of $n$-dimensional manifolds into $\mathbb{R}^d$ having their second fundamental forms bounded in the critical Sobolev space $W^{\frac{n}{2}-1,2}$ in dimension $n\geq 4$ even and any codimension. We prove that, while such a weak immersion is not necessary $C^1$, it generates a $C^1$ differential structure on the domain. More precisely, for any such an immersion, there is an atlas in which the first fundamental form is continuous and the transition maps are $C^1$. We prove that this $C^1$ structure is diffeomorphic to the original one. This result is the starting point of the analysis of the behavior of sequences of weak immersions with second fundamental forms uniformly bounded in the critical Sobolev space $W^{\frac{n}{2}-1,2}$. In the second part of the paper we establish a weakly sequential closure theorem for such sequences. This analysis is motivated by the study of conformally invariant Lagrangian of immersions in dimension larger than two such as generalized Willmore energies, for instance the Graham--Reichert functional obtained in the computation of renormalized volumes of five-dimensional minimal submanifolds of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{d+1}$.</description>

      <title>Construction of harmonic coordinates for weak immersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any weak immersion in the critical Sobolev space $W^{\frac{n}{2}+1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R}^d)$ in even dimension $n\geq 4$, has global harmonic coordinates if its second fundamental form is small in the Sobolev space $W^{\frac{n}{2}-1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R}^d)$. This is a generalization to arbitrary even dimension $n\ge 4$ of a famous result of M\"uller--Sverak \cite{muller1995} for $n=2$. The existence of such coordinates is a key tool used by the authors in \cite{MarRiv20252} for the analysis of scale-invariant Lagrangians of immersions, such as the Graham--Reichert functional. From a purely intrinsic perspective, the proof of the main result leads to a general local existence theorem of harmonic coordinates for general metrics with Riemann tensor in $L^p$ for any $p&gt;n/2$ in any dimension $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Comparison Theorems and the Intermediate Ricci Curvature Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the notion of m-intermediate Ricci curvature assumption introduced by Brendle-Hirsch-Johne further. If a manifold has non-negative m-intermediate Ricci curvature and stable weighted slicing of order m-1, then the last slice has almost non-negative Ricci curvature in the spectral sense. We prove comparison theorems on the diameter and in-radius bound for stable weighted (respectively free boundary) slicing in such manifolds (respectively with mean convex boundary).</description>

      <title>Symplectic groups over Lie subgroups of involutive algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}_2(G, \sigma)$ associated to a Lie subgroup $G$ of a (possibly noncommutative) associative algebra $A$ equipped with an anti-involution $\sigma$. Our construction recovers several classical Lie groups as special cases, and in particular provides new realizations of spin groups as instances of $\mathrm{Sp}_2(G, \sigma)$ for suitable subgroups $G$ of the Clifford algebra. This case is not covered by the framework, which focuses on the specific situation $G = A^\times$, and is thus of particular interest.
  We construct and study geometric spaces on which $\mathrm{Sp}_2(G, \sigma)$ acts. In particular, we define the space of $G$-isotropic elements and the corresponding space of $G$-isotropic lines, which generalize the classical projective line. We analyze the group action on these spaces and introduce natural invariants, such as the notion of positive triples and quadruples of $G$-isotropic lines and a generalized cross-ratio of positive quadruples of $G$-isotropic lines. Finally, when the Lie algebra of $G$ is Hermitian, we define the associated Riemannian symmetric space of $\mathrm{Sp}_2(G,\sigma)$ and provide several models for it.</description>

      <title>Marked Poincar\'e rigidity near hyperbolic metrics and injectivity of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact manifold without boundary equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$ of negative curvature. In this paper, we introduce the marked Poincar\'e determinant (MPD), a homothety invariant of $g$ depending on differentiable periodic data of its geodesic flow. The MPD associates to each free homotopy class of closed curves in $M$ a number which measures the unstable volume expansion of the geodesic flow along the associated closed geodesic. We prove a local MPD rigidity result in dimension 3: if $g$ is sufficiently close to a hyperbolic metric $g_0$ and both metrics have the same MPD, then they are homothetic. As a by-product of our proof, we show the Lichnerowicz Laplacian of $g_0$ is injective on the space of trace-free divergence-free symmetric 2-tensors, which, to our knowledge, is the first result of its kind in negative curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a family of mean curvature flow which converges to an area minimizing, strictly stable hypercone $\mC$ after type I rescaling, and converges to the Hardt-Simon foliation of the cone after a type II rescaling provided the cone satisfies some technique conditions. The difference from Vel\'azquez's previous results is that we drop the symmetry condition on the cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a local classification of certain special classes of surfaces determined by the prescription of the radial mean curvature in terms of the height and angle functions. Moreover, we introduce a special class of hypersurfaces, and we also provide a local classification of these three-dimensional hypersurfaces whose second mean curvature vanishes. Finally, we present a recursive method for constructing such hypersurfaces, extending the same curvature prescription approach to higher dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are an introduction to the use of non-Archimedean geometry in the study of meromorphic degenerations of complex algebraic varieties. They provide a self-contained discussion of hybrid spaces, which fill in one-parameter degenerations with the associated non-Archimedean Berkovich space as a central fiber. The main focus is on the interplay between complex and non-Archimedean pluripotential theory, and on the relation between convergence of psh metrics and the associated Monge-Ampere measures in the hybrid space, following work of the author with M.Jonsson, and recent breakthrough work by Y.Li.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of Causal Killing Vectors and Geometry of ADM Mass Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address two problems concerning the ADM mass-minimizing initial data sets. First, we show that the equality case of the positive mass theorem embeds into a pp-wave spacetime. Second, we show that positive Bartnik mass minimizers embed into strongly stationary vacuum spacetimes, thereby confirming the Bartnik stationary vacuum conjecture. A key ingredient is a new monotonicity formula for the Lorentzian length of a causal Killing vector field, which, among other applications, yields a strong maximum principle for the length.</description>

      <title>A vanishing property about the 1-filtered cohomology groups of (4n+2)-dimensional closed symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note is a follow-up to our previous work arXiv:2505.14496. For any (4n+2)-dimensional closed symplectic manifold, we find that the dimension of the even-degree part of its 1-filtered cohomology is even, similar to the vanishing property of the classical Euler characteristic of an odd-dimensional closed manifold. We prove our result by constructing and then deforming a skew-adjoint operator. This process follows the methods in arXiv:2505.14496 but needs adjustments on signs and the power of the symplectic form.</description>

      <title>A proof of Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture for WRT invariants of Seifert fibered homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a general Seifert fibered integral homology $3$-sphere with $r\ge3$ exceptional fibers. For every root of unity $\zeta\not=1$, we show that the SU(2) WRT invariant of $X$ evaluated at $\zeta$ is (up to an elementary factor) the non-tangential limit at $\zeta$ of the GPPV invariant of $X$, thereby generalizing a result from [Andersen-Mistegard 2022]. Based on this result, we apply the quantum modularity results developed in [Han-Li-Sauzin-Sun 2023] to the GPPV invariant of $X$ to prove Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture [Witten 1989] for the WRT invariant of $X$. We also prove that the GPPV invariant of $X$ induces a higher depth strong quantum modular form. Moreover, when suitably normalized, the GPPV invariant provides an ``analytic incarnation'' of the Habiro invariant.</description>

Abstract: Holding a shell in their hands, one can apply six loads: three by pulling and shearing, and three by bending and twisting. Here, it is shown that the shell will resist exactly three load cases and comply with the other three, provided the shell is simply connected, meaning it has no holes and no handles.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically large free semigroups in Zariski dense discrete subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected algebraic semisimple real Lie group with finite center and no compact factors, and let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of $G$. We show that $\Gamma$ contains free, finitely generated subsemigroups whose critical exponents are arbitrarily close to that of $\Gamma$. Furthermore, these subsemigroups are Zariski dense in $G$ and $P$-Anosov in the sense of Kassel--Potrie. This shows that no gap phenomenon holds for critical exponents of discrete subsemigroups of Lie groups, which in contrast with Leuzinger's critical exponent gap theorem for infinite covolume discrete subgroups of Lie groups with Kazhdan's property (T), proven in 2003.
  As an important step towards our construction, we introduce and study properties of a particular type of loxodromic element, which we call an $\epsilon$-contracting element, and construct our free subsemigroups in such a way that all of their elements are either $\epsilon$-contracting or $2\epsilon$-contracting. One of the main novelties in this approach is that it enables us to study the action of $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary $G/P$ intrinsically, in the sense that we do not embed $G/P$ into a product of projective spaces associated to the proximal irreducible algebraic Tits representations of $G$.
  This definition is inspired by the notion of $\epsilon$-proximal elements, which plays a prominent role in the seminal works of Abels--Margulis--Soifer on the actions of linear groups on projective spaces and of Benoist on algebraic and asymptotic properties of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups. We hope this perspective will lead to further developments in the study of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups and provide simpler proofs of results currently in the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a one-parameter family of varifolds has an $L^2$ normal velocity $v$ in the sense of Brakke, and if the family is represented as the graph of a continuous function $f$ with continuous spatial derivative $\nabla f$, then $f$ has weak derivatives $\partial_t f, \nabla^2 f \in L^2$, and $v$ coincides with the usual normal velocity of the graph. Moreover, by combining this result with parabolic regularity theory, we show that graphical Brakke flows with forcing term in $L^{p,q}$ and $C^{0,\alpha}$ are strong and classical solutions to the forced mean curvature flow equation, respectively.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of inverse boundary value problems to the setting of fully nonlinear PDEs by considering an inverse source problem for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation
  \[
  \det D^2 u = F.
  \]
  We prove that, on a convex Euclidean domain in the plane, the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map uniquely determines a positive source function $F$. The proof relies on recovering the Hessian of a solution to the equation, which is interpreted as a Riemannian metric $g$. Interestingly, although the equation is posed on a Euclidean domain, the inverse problem becomes anisotropic since the metric $g$ appears as a coefficient matrix in the linearized equation.
  As an intermediate step, we prove that the DN map of the non-divergence form equation
  \[
  g^{ab} \partial_{ab} v = 0
  \]
  uniquely determines the conformal class of the metric $g$ on a simply connected planar domain, without the usual diffeomorphism invariance.
  To address the challenges of full nonlinearity, we develop asymptotic expansions for complex geometric optics solutions in the planar setting and solve a resulting nonlocal
  $\overline{\partial}$-equation by proving a unique continuation principle for it. These techniques are expected to be applicable to a wide range of inverse problems for nonlinear equations.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study almost rigidity properties of super Ricci flow whose Muller quantity is non-negative. We conclude almost splitting and quantitative stratification theorems that have been established by Bamler for Ricci flow. As a byproduct, we obtain an almost constancy for a certain integral quantity concerning scalar curvature at an almost selfsimilar point, which is new even for Ricci flow.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities on Slabs with applications to Cubes and Gaussian Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study isoperimetric inequalities on "slabs", namely weighted Riemannian manifolds obtained as the product of the uniform measure on a finite length interval with a codimension-one base. As our two main applications, we consider the case when the base is the flat torus $\mathbb{R}^2 / 2 \mathbb{Z}^2$ and the standard Gaussian measure in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
  The isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube predicts that minimizers are enclosed by spheres about a corner, cylinders about an edge and coordinate planes. This has only been established for relative volumes close to $0$, $1/2$ and $1$ by compactness arguments. Our analysis confirms the isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube with side lengths $(\beta,1,1)$ in a new range of relatives volumes $\bar v \in [0,1/2]$. In particular, we confirm the conjecture for the standard cube ($\beta=1$) for all $\bar v \leq 0.120582$, when $\beta \leq 0.919431$ for the entire range where spheres are conjectured to be minimizing, and also for all $\bar v \in [0,1/2] \setminus (\frac{1}{\pi} - \frac{\beta}{4},\frac{1}{\pi} + \frac{\beta}{4})$. When $\beta \leq 0.919431$ we reduce the validity of the full conjecture to establishing that the half-plane $\{ x \in [0,\beta] \times [0,1]^2 \; ; \; x_3 \leq \frac{1}{\pi} \}$ is an isoperimetric minimizer. We also show that the analogous conjecture on a high-dimensional cube $[0,1]^n$ is false for $n \geq 10$.
  In the case of a slab with a Gaussian base of width $T&gt;0$, we identify a phase transition when $T = \sqrt{2 \pi}$ and when $T = \pi$. In particular, while products of half-planes with $[0,T]$ are always minimizing when $T \leq \sqrt{2 \pi}$, when $T &gt; \pi$ they are never minimizing, being beaten by Gaussian unduloids. In the range $T \in (\sqrt{2 \pi},\pi]$, a potential trichotomy occurs.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law and convergence in the classical limit for min-max nonlocal minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonlocal minimal surfaces as a new approximation theory for the area functional, and more specifically in the context of Yau's conjecture on the existence of minimal surfaces in closed three-dimensional manifolds. This programme offers an alternative to the Almgren--Pitts and Allen--Cahn approaches, with advantageous features both from the existence and regularity viewpoints.
  We build on recent work in which the author and collaborators constructed infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal hypersurfaces (via min-max methods) on any closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$, establishing a full analogue of Yau's conjecture for $s\in(0,1)$.
  The present article first proves a Weyl-type Law for the fractional perimeters of these hypersurfaces. The rest -- and main part -- of the article is devoted to obtaining uniform estimates (in the classical limit $s\to 1$) for min-max $s$-minimal surfaces in closed three-manifolds, eventually establishing their convergence to smooth, classical minimal surfaces. We recover in particular recent results on existence, generic density and equidistribution of minimal surfaces, which are a strong form of Yau's conjecture in this setting.</description>

Abstract: We count the number of connected components in the space of triples of transverse flags in any flag manifold of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and deduce that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit algorithm based on computation of minors to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{&gt;0}$ when $p\neq q$.</description>

      <title>The completeness problem on 3-dimensional non-unimodular Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the completeness problem for left-invariant Lorentzian metrics on 3-dimensional non-unimodular Lie groups, all of which have Lie algebra of the form $\mathbb{R} \ltimes_A \mathbb{R}^2$, where $A$ is a real $2 \times 2$ matrix with nonzero trace. The case where $A$ is not diagonalizable over $\mathbb{C}$ was addressed in previous work by the authors, and the limiting case where $A$ is a scalar multiple of the identity is also known from the literature. In this paper, we determine all geodesically (in)complete left-invariant Lorentzian metrics for all other cases where $A$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{R}$. Additionally, we show that, when $A$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{C}$ but not over $\mathbb{R}$, there exists at least one incomplete metric. As a consequence of prior work and our results, we obtain that every 3-dimensional non-unimodular Lie group admits an incomplete left-invariant Lorentzian metric.</description>

      <title>The basic component of the mean curvature of Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Riemannian foliation $F$ on a compact manifold $M$ with a bundle-like metric, the de Rham complex of $M$ is $C^{\infty}$-splitted as the direct sum of the basic complex and its orthogonal complement. Then the basic component $\kappa_{b}$ of the mean curvature form of $F$ is closed and defines a class $\xi(F)$ in the basic cohomology that is invariant under any change of the bundle-like metric. Moreover, any element in $\xi(F)$ can be realized as the basic component of the mean curvature of some bundle-like metric.
  It is also proved that $\xi(F)$ vanishes iff there exists some bundle-like metric on $M$ for which the leaves are minimal submanifolds. As a consequence, this tautness property is verified in any of the following cases: (a) when the Ricci curvature of the transverse Riemannian structure is positive, or (b) when $F$ is of codimension one. In particular, a compact manifold with a Riemannian foliation of codimension one has infinite fundamental group.
  A small correction of a lemma from the original manuscript is included as an addendum, written in collaboration with Ken Richardson.</description>

      <title>An Embedding Theorem for tractor bundles, and an application in conformal pseudo-Riemannian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an extension of the Gromov--Zimmer Embedding Theorem for Cartan geometries of [3] to tractor bundles carrying any invariant connection, including tractor connections and prolongation connections of first BGG operators for parabolic geometries. As an application, we prove a rigidity result for conformal actions of special pseudo-unitary groups on closed, simply connected, analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>On balanced Hermitian threefolds with parallel Bismut torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our study on Hermitian manifolds that are {\em Bismut torsion parallel,} or {\em BTP} for brevity, which means that the Bismut connection has parallel torsion tensor. For $n\geq 3$, BTP metrics can be balanced (and non-K\"ahler). In this paper, we give a detailed description to characterize all compact, balanced BTP threefolds.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the bending map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0411412</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0411412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bending map of a hyperbolic 3-manifold maps a convex cocompact hyperbolic metric on a hyperbolic 3-manifold with boundary to its bending measured geodesic lamination. In the present paper we study the extension of this map to the space of geometrically finite hyperbolic metrics. We introduce a relationship on the space of measured geodesic laminations and shows that the quotient map obtained from the bending map is continuous. October 2025, an erratum has been added that corrects an error in the main Theorem. The topology used in the quotient space should not be the quotient topology but the "tubular topology" defined in this erratum.</description>

      <title>Curvature properties and Shafarevich conjecture for toroidal compactifications of ball quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study toroidal compactifications of finite volume complex hyperbolic manifolds. We obtain results on the existence or nonexistence of K\"ahler metrics satisfying certain nonpositive curvature properties on these compactifications. Starting from quotients of complex hyperbolic space by deep enough non-uniform arithmetic lattices, we also verify the Shafarevich conjecture for their compactifications, by showing that their universal covers are Stein.</description>

      <title>Fine P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} rearrangement inequalities in metric spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fine P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} rearrangement inequalities into weighted intervals for Sobolev functions and functions of bounded variation defined on metric measure spaces supporting an isoperimetric inequality. We then specialize this theory to spaces with synthetic Ricci lower bounds and characterize equality cases under minimal assumptions. As applications of our theory, we show new results around geometric and functional inequalities under Ricci lower bounds answering also questions raised in the literature. Finally, we study further settings and deduce a Faber-Krahn theorem on Euclidean spaces with radial log-convex densities, a boosted P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality with asymmetry reminder on weighted convex cones, the rigidity of Sobolev inequalities on Euclidean spaces outside a convex set and a general lower bound for Neumann eigenvalues on open sets in metric spaces.</description>

      <title>A geometric formulation of GENERIC stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a coordinate-invariant geometric formulation of the GENERIC stochastic differential equation, unifying reversible Hamiltonian and irreversible dissipative dynamics within a differential-geometric framework. Our construction builds on the classical GENERIC or metriplectic formalism, extending it to manifolds by introducing a degenerate Poisson structure, a degenerate co-metric, and a volume form satisfying a unimodularity condition. The resulting equation preserves a particular Boltzmann-type measure, ensures almost-sure conservation of energy, and reduces to the deterministic GENERIC/metriplectic formulation in the zero-noise limit. This geometrization separates system-specific quantities from the ambient space, clarifies the roles of the underlying structures, and provides a foundation for analytic and numerical methods, as well as future extensions to quantum and coarse-grained systems.</description>
