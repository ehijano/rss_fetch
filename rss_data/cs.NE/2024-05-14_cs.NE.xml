      <title>Enhancing Decision-Making in Optimization through LLM-Assisted Inference: A Neural Networks Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the seamless integration of Generative AI (GenAI) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) within the domain of large-scale multi-objective optimization. Focusing on the transformative role of Large Language Models (LLMs), our study investigates the potential of LLM-Assisted Inference to automate and enhance decision-making processes. Specifically, we highlight its effectiveness in illuminating key decision variables in evolutionarily optimized solutions while articulating contextual trade-offs. Tailored to address the challenges inherent in inferring complex multi-objective optimization solutions at scale, our approach emphasizes the adaptive nature of LLMs, allowing them to provide nuanced explanations and align their language with diverse stakeholder expertise levels and domain preferences. Empirical studies underscore the practical applicability and impact of LLM-Assisted Inference in real-world decision-making scenarios.</description>

      <title>Case Study of Novelty, Complexity, and Adaptation in a Multicellular System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing generation of novelty, complexity, and adaptation are well-established as core aspects of open-ended evolution. However, it has yet to be firmly established to what extent these phenomena are coupled and by what means they interact. In this work, we track the co-evolution of novelty, complexity, and adaptation in a case study from the DISHTINY simulation system, which is designed to study the evolution of digital multicellularity. In this case study, we describe ten qualitatively distinct multicellular morphologies, several of which exhibit asymmetrical growth and distinct life stages. We contextualize the evolutionary history of these morphologies with measurements of complexity and adaptation. Our case study suggests a loose -- sometimes divergent -- relationship can exist among novelty, complexity, and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Impact of white Gaussian internal noise on analog echo-state neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, more and more works have appeared devoted to the analog (hardware) implementation of artificial neural networks, in which neurons and the connection between them are based not on computer calculations, but on physical principles. Such networks offer improved energy efficiency and, in some cases, scalability, but may be susceptible to internal noise. This paper studies the influence of noise on the functioning of recurrent networks using the example of trained echo state networks (ESNs). The most common reservoir connection matrices were chosen as various topologies of ESNs: random uniform and band matrices with different connectivity. White Gaussian noise was chosen as the influence, and according to the way of its introducing it was additive or multiplicative, as well as correlated or uncorrelated. In the paper, we show that the propagation of noise in reservoir is mainly controlled by the statistical properties of the output connection matrix, namely the mean and the mean square. Depending on these values, more correlated or uncorrelated noise accumulates in the network. We also show that there are conditions under which even noise with an intensity of $10^{-20}$ is already enough to completely lose the useful signal. In the article we show which types of noise are most critical for networks with different activation functions (hyperbolic tangent, sigmoid and linear) and if the network is self-closed.</description>

      <title>Fleet of Agents: Coordinated Problem Solving with Large Language Models using Genetic Particle Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly evolved, moving from simple output generation to complex reasoning and from stand-alone usage to being embedded into broader frameworks. In this paper, we introduce \emph{Fleet of Agents (FoA)}, a novel framework utilizing LLMs as agents to navigate through dynamic tree searches, employing a genetic-type particle filtering approach. FoA spawns a multitude of agents, each exploring autonomously, followed by a selection phase where resampling based on a heuristic value function optimizes the balance between exploration and exploitation. This mechanism enables dynamic branching, adapting the exploration strategy based on discovered solutions. We experimentally validate FoA using two benchmark tasks, "Game of 24" and "Mini-Crosswords". FoA outperforms the previously proposed Tree-of-Thoughts method in terms of efficacy and efficiency: it significantly decreases computational costs (by calling the value function less frequently) while preserving comparable or even superior accuracy.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear classification of neural manifolds with contextual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. Here, we propose a theoretical framework that overcomes this limitation by leveraging contextual input information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation untanglement in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Evolutionary Feature Construction in Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, genetic programming (GP)-based evolutionary feature construction has achieved significant success. However, a primary challenge with evolutionary feature construction is its tendency to overfit the training data, resulting in poor generalization on unseen data. In this research, we draw inspiration from PAC-Bayesian theory and propose using sharpness-aware minimization in function space to discover symbolic features that exhibit robust performance within a smooth loss landscape in the semantic space. By optimizing sharpness in conjunction with cross-validation loss, as well as designing a sharpness reduction layer, the proposed method effectively mitigates the overfitting problem of GP, especially when dealing with a limited number of instances or in the presence of label noise. Experimental results on 58 real-world regression datasets show that our approach outperforms standard GP as well as six state-of-the-art complexity measurement methods for GP in controlling overfitting. Furthermore, the ensemble version of GP with sharpness-aware minimization demonstrates superior performance compared to nine fine-tuned machine learning and symbolic regression algorithms, including XGBoost and LightGBM.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling in the Reservoir Kernel Motif Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a time series prediction method based on the kernel view of linear reservoirs. In particular, the time series motifs of the reservoir kernel are used as representational basis on which general readouts are constructed. We provide a geometric interpretation of our approach shedding light on how our approach is related to the core reservoir models and in what way the two approaches differ. Empirical experiments then compare predictive performances of our suggested model with those of recent state-of-art transformer based models, as well as the established recurrent network model - LSTM. The experiments are performed on both univariate and multivariate time series and with a variety of prediction horizons. Rather surprisingly we show that even when linear readout is employed, our method has the capacity to outperform transformer models on univariate time series and attain competitive results on multivariate benchmark datasets. We conclude that simple models with easily controllable capacity but capturing enough memory and subsequence structure can outperform potentially over-complicated deep learning models. This does not mean that reservoir motif based models are preferable to other more complex alternatives - rather, when introducing a new complex time series model one should employ as a sanity check simple, but potentially powerful alternatives/baselines such as reservoir models or the models introduced here.</description>

      <title>Ecology, Spatial Structure, and Selection Pressure Induce Strong Signatures in Phylogenetic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary dynamics are shaped by a variety of fundamental, generic drivers, including spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure. These drivers impact the trajectory of evolution, and have been hypothesized to influence phylogenetic structure. Here, we set out to assess (1) if spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure leave detectable signatures in phylogenetic structure, (2) the extent, in particular, to which ecology can be detected and discerned in the presence of spatial structure, and (3) the extent to which these phylogenetic signatures generalize across evolutionary systems. To this end, we analyze phylogenies generated by manipulating spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure within three computational models of varied scope and sophistication. We find that selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecology have characteristic effects on phylogenetic metrics, although these effects are complex and not always intuitive. Signatures have some consistency across systems when using equivalent taxonomic unit definitions (e.g., individual, genotype, species). Further, we find that sufficiently strong ecology can be detected in the presence of spatial structure. We also find that, while low-resolution phylogenetic reconstructions can bias some phylogenetic metrics, high-resolution reconstructions recapitulate them faithfully. Although our results suggest potential for evolutionary inference of spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure through phylogenetic analysis, further methods development is needed to distinguish these drivers' phylometric signatures from each other and to appropriately normalize phylogenetic metrics. With such work, phylogenetic analysis could provide a versatile toolkit to study large-scale evolving populations.</description>

      <title>Random walk model that universally generates inverse square L\'evy walk by eliminating search cost minimization constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy walk, a type of random walk characterized by linear step lengths that follow a power-law distribution, is observed in the migratory behaviors of various organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Notably, L\'evy walks with power exponents close to two are frequently observed, though their underlying causes remain elusive. This study introduces a simplified, abstract random walk model designed to produce inverse square L\'evy walks, also known as Cauchy walks and explores the conditions that facilitate these phenomena. In our model, agents move toward a randomly selected destination in multi-dimensional space, and their movement strategy is parameterized by the extent to which they pursue the shortest path. When the search cost is proportional to the distance traveled, this parameter effectively reflects the emphasis on minimizing search costs. Our findings reveal that strict adherence to this cost minimization constraint results in a Brownian walk pattern. However, removing this constraint transitions the movement to an inverse square L\'evy walk. Therefore, by modulating the prioritization of search costs, our model can seamlessly alternate between Brownian and Cauchy walk dynamics. This model has the potential to be utilized for exploring the parameter space of an optimization problem.</description>

      <title>The Platonic Representation Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.</description>

      <title>LitE-SNN: Designing Lightweight and Efficient Spiking Neural Network through Spatial-Temporal Compressive Network Search and Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) mimic the information-processing mechanisms of the human brain and are highly energy-efficient, making them well-suited for low-power edge devices. However, the pursuit of accuracy in current studies leads to large, long-timestep SNNs, conflicting with the resource constraints of these devices. In order to design lightweight and efficient SNNs, we propose a new approach named LitE-SNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal compression into the automated network design process. Spatially, we present a novel Compressive Convolution block (CompConv) to expand the search space to support pruning and mixed-precision quantization. Temporally, we are the first to propose a compressive timestep search to identify the optimal number of timesteps under specific computation cost constraints. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization to simultaneously learn the architecture parameters and spatial-temporal compression strategies to achieve high performance while minimizing memory and computation costs. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Google Speech Command datasets demonstrate our proposed LitE-SNNs can achieve competitive or even higher accuracy with remarkably smaller model sizes and fewer computation costs.</description>

      <title>Human Curriculum Effects Emerge with In-Context Learning in Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human learning is sensitive to rule-like structure and the curriculum of examples used for training. In tasks governed by succinct rules, learning is more robust when related examples are blocked across trials, but in the absence of such rules, interleaving is more effective. To date, no neural model has simultaneously captured these seemingly contradictory effects. Here we show that this same tradeoff spontaneously emerges with ``in-context learning'' (ICL) both in neural networks trained with metalearning and in large language models (LLMs). ICL is the ability to learn new tasks ``in context'' -- without weight changes -- via an inner-loop algorithm implemented in activation dynamics. Experiments with pretrained LLMs and metalearning transformers show that ICL exhibits the blocking advantage demonstrated in humans on a task involving rule-like structure, and conversely, that concurrent in-weight learning reproduces the interleaving advantage observed in humans on tasks lacking such structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02090v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experience shows that typical evolutionary algorithms can cope well with stochastic disturbances such as noisy function evaluations.
  In this first mathematical runtime analysis of the $(1+\lambda)$ and $(1,\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithms in the presence of prior bit-wise noise, we show that both algorithms can tolerate constant noise probabilities without increasing the asymptotic runtime on the OneMax benchmark. For this, a population size $\lambda$ suffices that is at least logarithmic in the problem size $n$. The only previous result in this direction regarded the less realistic one-bit noise model, required a population size super-linear in the problem size, and proved a runtime guarantee roughly cubic in the noiseless runtime for the OneMax benchmark. Our significantly stronger results are based on the novel proof argument that the noiseless offspring can be seen as a biased uniform crossover between the parent and the noisy offspring. We are optimistic that the technical lemmas resulting from this insight will find applications also in future mathematical runtime analyses of evolutionary algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This paper first proposes the Halfway Escape Optimization (HEO) algorithm, a novel quantum-inspired metaheuristic designed to address complex optimization problems characterized by rugged landscapes and high-dimensionality with an efficient convergence rate. The study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of HEO's performance against established optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The primary analysis encompasses 14 benchmark functions with dimension 30, demonstrating HEO's effectiveness and adaptability in navigating complex optimization landscapes and providing valuable insights into its performance. The simple test of HEO in Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) also infers its feasibility in real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Concentration Tail-Bound Analysis of Coevolutionary and Bandit Learning Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Runtime analysis, as a branch of the theory of AI, studies how the number of iterations algorithms take before finding a solution (its runtime) depends on the design of the algorithm and the problem structure. Drift analysis is a state-of-the-art tool for estimating the runtime of randomised algorithms, such as evolutionary and bandit algorithms. Drift refers roughly to the expected progress towards the optimum per iteration. This paper considers the problem of deriving concentration tail-bounds on the runtime/regret of algorithms. It provides a novel drift theorem that gives precise exponential tail-bounds given positive, weak, zero and even negative drift. Previously, such exponential tail bounds were missing in the case of weak, zero, or negative drift. Our drift theorem can be used to prove a strong concentration of the runtime/regret of algorithms in AI. For example, we prove that the regret of the \rwab bandit algorithm is highly concentrated, while previous analyses only considered the expected regret. This means that the algorithm obtains the optimum within a given time frame with high probability, i.e. a form of algorithm reliability. Moreover, our theorem implies that the time needed by the co-evolutionary algorithm RLS-PD to obtain a Nash equilibrium in a \bilinear max-min-benchmark problem is highly concentrated. However, we also prove that the algorithm forgets the Nash equilibrium, and the time until this occurs is highly concentrated. This highlights a weakness in the RLS-PD which should be addressed by future work.</description>

Abstract: Attribute-based Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) has revolutionized the ability of models to recognize new classes not seen during training. However, with the advancement of large-scale models, the expectations have risen. Beyond merely achieving zero-shot generalization, there is a growing demand for universal models that can continually evolve in expert domains using unlabeled data. To address this, we introduce a scaled-down instantiation of this challenge: Evolutionary Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (EGZSL). This setting allows a low-performing zero-shot model to adapt to the test data stream and evolve online. We elaborate on three challenges of this special task, \ie, catastrophic forgetting, initial prediction bias, and evolutionary data class bias. Moreover, we propose targeted solutions for each challenge, resulting in a generic method capable of continuous evolution from a given initial IGZSL model. Experiments on three popular GZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model can learn from the test data stream while other baselines fail.

Abstract: Providing a model that achieves a strong predictive performance and is simultaneously interpretable by humans is one of the most difficult challenges in machine learning research due to the conflicting nature of these two objectives. To address this challenge, we propose a modification of the radial basis function neural network model by equipping its Gaussian kernel with a learnable precision matrix. We show that precious information is contained in the spectrum of the precision matrix that can be extracted once the training of the model is completed. In particular, the eigenvectors explain the directions of maximum sensitivity of the model revealing the active subspace and suggesting potential applications for supervised dimensionality reduction. At the same time, the eigenvectors highlight the relationship in terms of absolute variation between the input and the latent variables, thereby allowing us to extract a ranking of the input variables based on their importance to the prediction task enhancing the model interpretability. We conducted numerical experiments for regression, classification, and feature selection tasks, comparing our model against popular machine learning models, the state-of-the-art deep learning-based embedding feature selection techniques, and a transformer model for tabular data. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model does not only yield an attractive prediction performance compared to the competitors but also provides meaningful and interpretable results that potentially could assist the decision-making process in real-world applications. A PyTorch implementation of the model is available on GitHub at the following link. https://github.com/dannyzx/Gaussian-RBFNN</description>
