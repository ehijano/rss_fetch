      <title>Pano2Room: Novel View Synthesis from a Single Indoor Panorama</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent single-view 3D generative methods have made significant advancements by leveraging knowledge distilled from extensive 3D object datasets. However, challenges persist in the synthesis of 3D scenes from a single view, primarily due to the complexity of real-world environments and the limited availability of high-quality prior resources. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Pano2Room, designed to automatically reconstruct high-quality 3D indoor scenes from a single panoramic image. These panoramic images can be easily generated using a panoramic RGBD inpainter from captures at a single location with any camera. The key idea is to initially construct a preliminary mesh from the input panorama, and iteratively refine this mesh using a panoramic RGBD inpainter while collecting photo-realistic 3D-consistent pseudo novel views. Finally, the refined mesh is converted into a 3D Gaussian Splatting field and trained with the collected pseudo novel views. This pipeline enables the reconstruction of real-world 3D scenes, even in the presence of large occlusions, and facilitates the synthesis of photo-realistic novel views with detailed geometry. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of our method in single-panorama indoor novel synthesis compared to the state-of-the-art.

      <title>Iterative Object Count Optimization for Text-to-image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a persistent challenge in text-to-image models: accurately generating a specified number of objects. Current models, which learn from image-text pairs, inherently struggle with counting, as training data cannot depict every possible number of objects for any given object. To solve this, we propose optimizing the generated image based on a counting loss derived from a counting model that aggregates an object\'s potential. Employing an out-of-the-box counting model is challenging for two reasons: first, the model requires a scaling hyperparameter for the potential aggregation that varies depending on the viewpoint of the objects, and second, classifier guidance techniques require modified models that operate on noisy intermediate diffusion steps. To address these challenges, we propose an iterated online training mode that improves the accuracy of inferred images while altering the text conditioning embedding and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters. Our method offers three key advantages: (i) it can consider non-derivable counting techniques based on detection models, (ii) it is a zero-shot plug-and-play solution facilitating rapid changes to the counting techniques and image generation methods, and (iii) the optimized counting token can be reused to generate accurate images without additional optimization. We evaluate the generation of various objects and show significant improvements in accuracy. The project page is available at https://ozzafar.github.io/count_token.</description>

      <title>HYVE: Hybrid Vertex Encoder for Neural Distance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural shape representation generally refers to representing 3D geometry using neural networks, e.g., computing a signed distance or occupancy value at a specific spatial position. In this paper we present a neural-network architecture suitable for accurate encoding of 3D shapes in a single forward pass. Our architecture is based on a multi-scale hybrid system incorporating graph-based and voxel-based components, as well as a continuously differentiable decoder. The hybrid system includes a novel way of voxelizing point-based features in neural networks, which we show can be used in combination with oriented point-clouds to obtain smoother and more detailed reconstructions. Furthermore, our network is trained to solve the eikonal equation and only requires knowledge of the zero-level set for training and inference. This means that in contrast to most previous shape encoder architectures, our network is able to output valid signed distance fields without explicit prior knowledge of non-zero distance values or shape occupancy. It also requires only a single forward-pass, instead of the latent-code optimization used in auto-decoder methods. We further propose a modification to the loss function in case that surface normals are not well defined, e.g., in the context of non-watertight surfaces and non-manifold geometry, resulting in an unsigned distance field. Overall, our system can help to reduce the computational overhead of training and evaluating neural distance fields, as well as enabling the application to difficult geometry.</description>

      <title>A Practical Solver for Scalar Data Topological Simplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a practical approach for the optimization of topological simplification, a central pre-processing step for the analysis and visualization of scalar data. Given an input scalar field f and a set of "signal" persistence pairs to maintain, our approach produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of "non-signal" pairs, while (ii) preserving the "signal" pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification algorithms, our approach is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our approach enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our approach can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation for reproducibility purposes.</description>

      <title>Freehand Sketch Generation from Mechanical Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing freehand sketches of mechanical components on multimedia devices for AI-based engineering modeling has become a new trend. However, its development is being impeded because existing works cannot produce suitable sketches for data-driven research. These works either generate sketches lacking a freehand style or utilize generative models not originally designed for this task resulting in poor effectiveness. To address this issue, we design a two-stage generative framework mimicking the human sketching behavior pattern, called MSFormer, which is the first time to produce humanoid freehand sketches tailored for mechanical components. The first stage employs Open CASCADE technology to obtain multi-view contour sketches from mechanical components, filtering perturbing signals for the ensuing generation process. Meanwhile, we design a view selector to simulate viewpoint selection tasks during human sketching for picking out information-rich sketches. The second stage translates contour sketches into freehand sketches by a transformer-based generator. To retain essential modeling features as much as possible and rationalize stroke distribution, we introduce a novel edge-constraint stroke initialization. Furthermore, we utilize a CLIP vision encoder and a new loss function incorporating the Hausdorff distance to enhance the generalizability and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for generating freehand sketches in the mechanical domain.
