      <title>Asymptotically CAT(0) metrics, Z-structures, and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that colorable hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHGs) admit asymptotically CAT(0) metrics, that is, roughly, metrics where the CAT(0) inequality holds up to sublinear error in the size of the triangle.
  We use the asymptotically CAT(0) metrics to construct contractible simplicial complexes and compactifications that provide $\mathcal{Z}$-structures in the sense of Bestvina and Dranishnikov. It was previously unknown that mapping class groups are asymptotically CAT(0) and admit $\mathcal{Z}$-structures. As an application, we prove that many HHGs satisfy the Farrell--Jones Conjecture, including extra large-type Artin groups.
  To construct asymptotically CAT(0) metrics, we show that hulls of finitely many points in a colorable HHGs can be approximated by CAT(0) cube complexes in a way that adding a point to the finite set corresponds, up to finitely many hyperplanes deletions, to a convex embedding.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Nielsen realization for del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cyclic Nielsen realization problem for a closed, oriented manifold asks whether any mapping class of finite order can be represented by a homeomorphism of the same order. In this article, we resolve the smooth, metric, and complex cyclic Nielsen realization problem for certain "irreducible" mapping classes on the family of smooth 4-manifolds underlying del Pezzo surfaces. Both positive and negative examples of realizability are provided in various settings. Our techniques are varied, synthesizing results from reflection group theory and 4-manifold topology.</description>

      <title>Small genus, small index critical points of the systole function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the index of a family of critical points of the systole function on Teichm\"uller space is calculated. The members of this family are interesting in that their existence implies the existence of strata in the Thurston spine for which the systoles do not determine a basis for the homology of the surface. Previously, index calculations of critical points with this pathological feature were impossible, because the only known examples were in surfaces with huge genus.
  A related concept is that of a ``minimal filling subset'' of the systoles at the critical point. Such minimal filling sets are studied, as they relate to the dimension of the Thurston spine near the critical point. We find an example of a minimal filling set of simple closed geodesics in genus 5 with cardinality 8, that are presumably realised as systoles. More generally, we determine the smallest and largest cardinality of a minimal filling set related to a tesselation of a hyperbolic surface by regular, right-angled $m$-gons for $m \in \{ 5, 6, 7 \}$. For this, we use integer linear programming together with a hand-tailored symmetry breaking technique.</description>

      <title>On spaces of Euclidean triangles and triangulated Euclidean surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an asymmetric metric on the space of marked Euclidean triangles, and we prove several properties of this metric, including two equivalent definitions of this metric, one of them comparing ratios of functions of the edges, and the other one in terms of best Lipschitz maps. We give a description of the geodesics of this metric. We show that this metric is Finsler, and give a formula for its infinitesimal Finsler structure. We then generalise this study to the case of convex Euclidean polygons in the Euclidean plane and to surfaces equipped with singular Euclidean structures with an underlying fixed triangulation. After developing some elements of the theory of completeness and completion of asymmetric metrics which is adapted to our setting, we study the completeness of the metrics we introduce in this paper. These problems and the results obtained are motivated by Thurston's work developed in his paper Minimal stretch maps between hyperbolic surfaces. We provide an analogue of Thurston's theory in a Euclidean setting.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-$k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework for the Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory with gauge group $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ at an even level $k\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. Our approach follows the procedure of combinatorial quantization to construct the operator algebras of quantum holonomies on 2-surfaces and develop the representation theory. The $*$-representation of the operator algebra is carried by the infinite dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\vec{\lambda}}$ and closely connects to the infinite-dimensional $*$-representation of the quantum deformed Lorentz group $\mathscr{U}_{\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{2\pi i}{k}(1+b^2)]$ and $\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{2\pi i}{k}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $|b|=1$. The quantum group $\mathscr{U}_{\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$ also emerges from the quantum gauge transformations of the complex Chern-Simons theory. Focusing on a $m$-holed sphere $\Sigma_{0,m}$, the physical Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ is identified by imposing the gauge invariance and the flatness constraint. The states in $\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ are the $\mathscr{U}_{\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$-invariant linear functionals on a dense domain in $\mathcal{H}_{\vec{\lambda}}$. Finally, we demonstrate that the physical Hilbert space carries a Fenchel-Nielsen representation, where a set of Wilson loop operators associated with a pants decomposition of $\Sigma_{0,m}$ are diagonalized.</description>

      <title>Simplified Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banyaga and Hurtubise defined the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex as a quotient of a large chain complex by introducing five degeneracy relations. In this paper, we unify the five conditions into only one degeneracy condition. This allows for a simpler definition of Morse-Bott homology and more computable examples. Moreover, we show that our chain complex for a Morse-Smale function is quasi-isomorphic to the Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex. As a result, we obtain another proof of the Morse Homology Theorem.</description>

      <title>Formal Manifold Structures on Positive Characteristic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his ICM report, Sullivan proposes the program of l-adic formalization of the concept of manifolds. In this program, he claims that smooth positive characteristic varieties should carry l-adic formal manifold structures. He also claims the existence of an abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures. This paper carries out this program, establishes the claims, and relates the abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures to the Galois symmetry of varieties. Meanwhile, we prove that simply-connected varieties are homotopically finite CW complexes in the l-adic sense.</description>

      <title>On chain link surgeries bounding rational homology balls and $\chi$-slice 3-braid closures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06573v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine which integral surgeries on a large class of circular chain links bound rational homology balls. Our key tool is the lattice-theoretic cubiquity obstruction recently developed by Greene and Owens. We discuss a practical method of computing it, and, as an application, prove that a generalisation of the slice--ribbon conjecture holds for all but one infinite family of quasi-alternating 3-braid links. This extends previous results of Lisca concerning the conjecture for 3-braid knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a vanishing theorem for non-fibered knots due to Friedl and Vidussi, we define the twisted Alexander vanishing order of a knot to be the order of the smallest finite group such that the corresponding twisted Alexander polynomial is zero. In this paper, we show its basic properties, and provide several explicit values for knots with $10$ or fewer crossings. Moreover, we characterize a finite group admitting the zero-twisted Alexander polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new homotopy invariant of metric spaces, called the distributional LS-category, was defined, which provides a lower bound to the classical LS-category. In this paper, we obtain several sufficient conditions for the distributional LS-category (dcat) of a closed manifold to be maximum, i.e., equal to its classical LS-category (cat). These give us many new computations of dcat, especially for some essential manifolds and (generalized) connected sums. In the process, we also determine the cat of closed 3-manifolds having torsion-free fundamental groups and some closed geometrically decomposable 4-manifolds. Finally, we extend some of our results to closed Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below and discuss their cat and dcat in dimension 3.</description>

      <title>An exploration of low crossing and chiral cosmetic bands with grid diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We computationally explore non-coherent band attachments between low crossing number knots, using grid diagrams. We significantly improve the current H(2)-distance table. In particular, we find two new distance one pairs with fewer than seven crossings: one between $3_1\#3_1$ and $7_4m$, and a chirally cosmetic one for $7_3$. We further determine a total of 33 previously unknown $H(2)$-distance one pairs for knots with up to $8$ crossings. The appendix by Kazuhiro Ichihara, In Dae Jong and Masakazu Teragaito contains a construction explaining the existence of chirally cosmetic bands for an infinite family of knots, including $5_1,\, 7_3$ and $8_8$.</description>

      <title>Measure equivalence rigidity of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $N\ge 3$, the group $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ of outer automorphisms of a free group of rank $N$ is superrigid from the point of view of measure equivalence: any countable group that is measure equivalent to $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$, is in fact virtually isomorphic to $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$.
  We introduce three new constructions of canonical splittings associated to a subgroup of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ of independent interest. They encode respectively the collection of invariant free splittings, invariant cyclic splittings, and maximal invariant free factor systems. Our proof also relies on the following improvement of an amenability result by Bestvina and the authors: given a free factor system $\mathcal{F}$ of $F_N$, the action of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N,\mathcal{F})$ (the subgroup of $\mathrm{Out}(F_N)$ that preserves $\mathcal{F}$) on the space of relatively arational trees with amenable stabilizer is a Borel amenable action.</description>

      <title>Four dimensional almost complex torus manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dimension 4, we extend the correspondence between compact nonsingular toric varieties and regular fans to a correspondence between almost complex torus manifolds and families of multi-fans in a geometric way, where an (almost) complex torus manifold is a $2n$-dimensional compact connected (almost) complex manifold equipped with an effective action of a real $n$-dimensional torus $T^n$ that has fixed points.
  Let $M$ be a 4-dimensional almost complex torus manifold. To $M$, we associate two equivalent combinatorial objects, a family $\Delta$ of multi-fans and a graph $\Gamma$, which encode the data on the fixed point set. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for each of $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$.
  Moreover, we provide a minimal model and operations for each of $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$. We introduce operations on a multi-fan and a graph that correspond to blow up and down of a manifold, and show that we can blow up and down $M$ to a minimal manifold $M'$ whose weights at the fixed points are unit vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^2$, $\Delta$ to a family of minimal multi-fans that has unit vectors only, and $\Gamma$ to a minimal graph whose edges all have unit vectors as labels.
  As an application, if $M$ is complex, $\Delta$ is a fan and determines $M$, $\Gamma$ encodes the equivariant cohomology of $M$, and $M'$ is $\mathbb{CP}^1 \times \mathbb{CP}^1$. This implies that any two 4-dimensional complex torus manifolds are obtained from each other by equivariant blow up and down.</description>

      <title>On sequential versions of distributional topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17218v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a (non-decreasing) sequence $\{\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ of higher versions of distributional topological complexity ($\mathsf{dTC}$) of a space $X$ introduced by Dranishnikov and Jauhari. This sequence generalizes $\mathsf{dTC}(X)$ in the sense that $\mathsf{dTC}_2(X) = \mathsf{dTC}(X)$, and is a direct analog to the classical sequence $\{\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$. We show that like $\mathsf{TC}_m$ and $\mathsf{dTC}$, the sequential versions $\mathsf{dTC}_m$ are also homotopy invariants. Also, $\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)$ relates with the distributional LS-category ($\mathsf{dcat}$) of products of $X$ in the same way as $\mathsf{TC}_m(X)$ relates with the classical LS-category ($\mathsf{cat}$) of products of $X$. On one hand, we show that in general, $\mathsf{dTC}_m$ is a different concept than $\mathsf{TC}_m$ for each $m \ge 2$. On the other hand, by finding sharp cohomological lower bounds to $\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)$, we provide various examples of closed manifolds $X$ for which the sequences $\{\mathsf{TC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ and $\{\mathsf{dTC}_m(X)\}_{m\ge 2}$ coincide.</description>

      <title>Contact homology of contact manifolds and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a survey of contact homology and its applications to the study of contact manifolds. It is a small tribute to Yasha Eliashberg's huge generosity with his countless explanations of his deep mathematical insights all along his career. It is also the author's wishful thinking that this text could be useful to students and young mathematicians for learning about some of the holomorphic curves based invariants in contact geometry.</description>
