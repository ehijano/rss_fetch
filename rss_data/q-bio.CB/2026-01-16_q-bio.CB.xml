      <title>Is E. coli good at chemotaxis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacteria seem masters of chemotaxis, yet recent work suggests otherwise. Henry Mattingly and colleagues (Nature Physics, 2026) argue that Escherichia coli uses only a small fraction of the sensory information available at its surface, challenging the long-held view that bacterial chemotaxis operates near physical sensing limits. This article offers a brief conceptual discussion of their findings, placing them in the context of classical chemotaxis models, robustness to noise, and broader perspectives drawn from physics, biology, and Greek mythology.</description>

      <title>Topological constraints on self-organisation in locally interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.</description>
