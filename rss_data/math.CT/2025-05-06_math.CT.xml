      <title>On functoriality and the tensor product property in noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two pertinent questions for any support theory of a monoidal triangulated category are whether it is functorial and if the tensor product property holds. To this end, we consider the complete prime spectrum of an essentially small monoidal triangulated category, which we show is universal among support data satisfying the tensor product property, even if it is empty. We show the complete prime spectrum is functorial and give a characterization of when a monoidal exact functor induces a well-defined map on noncommutative Balmer spectra. We give criteria for when induced maps on complete prime spectra are injective or surjective, and determine the complete prime spectrum for crossed product categories. Finally, we determine the universal functorial support theory for monoidal triangulated categories coinciding with the Balmer spectrum on braided monoidal triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>On unification of categories associated with F -transforms and fuzzy pretopological spaces as Qua category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, our motive is to unify the categories associated with F-transforms and fuzzy pretopological spaces as a new category Qua, whose object classes are success measurements of answers and morphisms are pairs of success measurements of transformations. Specifically, the categories of spaces with L-valued fuzzy partitions, L-valued fuzzy lower transformation systems, L-valued fuzzy pretopological spaces, and Cech L-valued fuzzy interior spaces with the morphisms as pairs of L-valued fuzzy relations between the underlying sets of corresponding objects have intriguing relationships with the category Qua.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Actions of Groups on Tensor Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a group $G$ and a 4-cocycle $\pi\in Z^{4}(G,\mathbb{k}^{\times})$, a $\pi$-anomalous action of $G$ on a linear monoidal category $C$ is a linear monoidal 2-functor between 3-groups $3\text{-Gr}(G,\pi)\rightarrow \text{2-Aut}_\otimes(C)$ where the latter denotes the 3-group of autoequivalences of $C$. Given $G$ and $\pi$, we provide a method of constructing anomalous actions of $3\text{-Gr}(G,\pi)$ on a tensor categories.</description>

      <title>Syllepses from 3-shifted Poisson structures and second-order integration of infinitesimal 2-braidings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper follows on from ``Infinitesimal 2-braidings from 2-shifted Poisson structures". It is demonstrated that the hexagonators appearing at second order satisfy the requisite axioms of a braided monoidal cochain 2-category provided that the strict infinitesimal 2-braiding is totally symmetric and coherent (in Cirio and Faria Martins' sense). We show that those infinitesimal 2-braidings induced by 2-shifted Poisson structures are indeed totally symmetric and we relate coherency to the third-weight component of the Maurer-Cartan equation that a 2-shifted Poisson structure must satisfy. Furthermore, we show that 3-shifted Poisson structures and ``coboundary" 2-shifted Poisson structures induce syllepses.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of higher Segal spaces at the interface of cyclic polytopes, orientals, and higher correspondences. Along the way we review examples from algebraic K-theory, show how cyclic polytopes provide a geometric model for the definition of orientals, and establish a characterization of higher Segal spaces as lax monadic structures in higher correspondence categories.</description>

      <title>Limits over orbit categories of locally finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We correct an error in the paper [BLO3], and take the opportunity to examine in more detail the derived functors of inverse limits over orbit categories of (infinite) locally finite groups. The main results show how to reduce this in many cases to limits over orbit categories of finite groups, but we also look at generalizations of the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for higher limits over orbit categories for an extension of locally finite groups.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Stable Infinity Categories with Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 2000s, Balmer constructed a ringed space from a triangulated category with a tensor structure. It provides a beautiful classification of tensor ideals. However, some categories, such as the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves or the triangulated category of singularities of a scheme, do not have canonical tensor structures. We constructed a ringed space from a stable \(\infty\)-category with action as an analog. The aforementioned examples have canonical action of the category of perfect complexes, and their associated spaces contain information about the singularities of the scheme.
  Recently, Matsui introduced a ringed space from a triangulated category. However, it can be huge and hard to calculate. Our approach describes subspaces of the Matsui spectrum, which is more manageable due to their fiber decomposition.</description>

      <title>Modal Fracture of Higher Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the modal aspects of higher groups in Shulman's Cohesive Homotopy Type Theory. We show that every higher group sits within a modal fracture hexagon which renders it into its discrete, infinitesimal, and contractible components. This gives an unstable and synthetic construction of Schreiber's differential cohomology hexagon. As an example of this modal fracture hexagon, we recover the character diagram characterizing ordinary differential cohomology by its relation to its underlying integral cohomology and differential form data, although there is a subtle obstruction to generalizing the usual hexagon to higher types. Assuming the existence of a long exact sequence of differential form classifiers, we construct the classifiers for circle k-gerbes with connection and describe their modal fracture hexagon.</description>

      <title>Lifting couplings in Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper makes mathematically precise the idea that conditional probabilities are analogous to path liftings in geometry.
  The idea of lifting is modelled in terms of the category-theoretic concept of a lens, which can be interpreted as a consistent choice of arrow liftings. The category we study is the one of probability measures over a given standard Borel space, with morphisms given by the couplings, or transport plans.
  The geometrical picture is even more apparent once we equip the arrows of the category with weights, which one can interpret as "lengths" or "costs", forming a so-called weighted category, which unifies several concepts of category theory and metric geometry.
  Indeed, we show that the weighted version of a lens is tightly connected to the notion of submetry in geometry.
  Every weighted category gives rise to a pseudo-quasimetric space via optimization over the arrows. In particular, Wasserstein spaces can be obtained from the weighted categories of probability measures and their couplings, with the weight of a coupling given by its cost.
  In this case, conditionals allow one to form weighted lenses, which one can interpret as "lifting transport plans, while preserving their cost".</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, motivated by the study of central extensions of associative algebras, G. Janelidze introduces the notion of weakly action representable category. In this paper, we show that the category of Leibniz algebras is weakly action representable and we characterize the class of acting morphisms. Moreover, we study the representability of actions of the category of Poisson algebras by describing explicitly a universal strict general actor.</description>

      <title>Drazin Inverses in Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drazin inverses are a fundamental algebraic structure which have been extensively deployed in semigroup theory, ring theory, and matrix theory. Drazin inverses can also be defined for endomorphisms in any category. However, beyond a paper by Puystjens and Robinson from 1987, there has been almost no further development of Drazin inverses in category theory. Here we provide a survey of the theory of Drazin inverses from a categorical perspective. We introduce Drazin categories, in which every endomorphism has a Drazin inverse, and provide various examples including the category of matrices over a field, the category of finite length modules over a ring, and finite set enriched categories. We also introduce the notion of expressive rank and prove that a category with expressive rank is Drazin. Moreover, we not only study Drazin inverses in mere categories, but also in additive categories and dagger categories. In an arbitrary category, we show how a Drazin inverse corresponds to an isomorphism in the idempotent splitting, as well as explain how Drazin inverses relate to Leinster's notion of eventual image duality. In additive categories, we consider core-nilpotent decompositions, image-kernel decompositions, and Fitting decompositions. We also develop the notion of Drazin inverses for pairs of opposing maps, generalizing the usual notion of Drazin inverse for endomorphisms. As an application of this new kind of Drazin inverse, for dagger categories, we provide a novel characterization of the Moore-Penrose inverse in terms of being a Drazin inverse of the pair of a map and its adjoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10822v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper considers non-Abelian homology groups for a diagram of groups introduced as homotopy groups of a simplicial replacement. It is proved that the non-Abelian homology groups of the group diagram are isomorphic to the homotopy groups of the homotopy colimit of the diagram of classifying spaces, with a dimension shift of 1. As an application, a method is developed for finding a nonzero homotopy group of least dimension for a homotopy colimit of classifying spaces. For a group diagram over a free category with a zero colimit, a criterion for the isomorphism of the first non-Abelian and first Abelian homology groups is obtained. It is established that the non-Abelian homology groups are isomorphic to the cotriple derived functors of the colimit functor defined on the category of group diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalise the essential data of objective functions as equality constraints on composites of learners. We call these constraints "tasks", and we investigate the idealised view that such tasks determine model behaviours. We develop a flowchart-like graphical mathematics for tasks that allows us to; (1) offer a unified perspective of approaches in machine learning across domains; (2) design and optimise desired behaviours model-agnostically; and (3) import insights from theoretical computer science into practical machine learning. As a proof-of-concept of the potential practical impact of our theoretical framework, we exhibit and implement a novel "manipulator" task that minimally edits input data to have a desired attribute. Our model-agnostic approach achieves this end-to-end, and without the need for custom architectures, adversarial training, random sampling, or interventions on the data, hence enabling capable, small-scale, and training-stable models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of oriented manifolds with boundaries called the forest biassociahedra and forest bimultiplihedra, generalizing the standard biassociahedra. They are defined as moduli spaces of ascending-descending biforests and are expected to act as parameter spaces for operations defined on Morse and Floer chains in the context of compact Lie group actions.
  We study the structure of their boundary, and derive some algebraic notions of ``$f$-bialgebras'', as well as related notions of bimodules, morphisms and categories. This allows us to state some conjectures describing compact Lie group actions on Morse and Floer chains, and on Fukaya categories.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2211.04917, it was shown that, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, every fusion 2-category is Morita equivalent to a connected fusion 2-category, that is, one arising from a braided fusion 1-category. This result has recently allowed for a complete classification of fusion 2-categories. Here we establish that compact semisimple tensor 2-categories, which generalize fusion 2-categories to an arbitrary field of characteristic zero, also enjoy this ``Morita connectedness'' property. In order to do so, we generalize to an arbitrary field of characteristic zero many well-known results about braided fusion 1-categories over an algebraically closed field. Most notably, we prove that the Picard group of any braided fusion 1-category is indfinite, generalizing the classical fact that the Brauer group of a field is torsion. As an application of our main result, we derive the existence of braided fusion 1-categories indexed by the fourth Galois cohomology group of the absolute Galois group that represent interesting classes in the appropriate Witt groups.</description>
