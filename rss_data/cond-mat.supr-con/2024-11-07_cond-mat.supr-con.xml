      <title>Quantum geometry induced microwave enhancement of flat band superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-control of correlated phases is central to advancing and manipulating novel functional properties of quantum materials. Here, we explore microwave enhancement of superconductivity in flat bands through generation of nonequilibrium quasiparticles at subgap frequencies. In conventional superconductors, it is known to occur via radiation absorption determined by fermi velocity, which however is small in flat bands resulting in quenched quasiparticle excitations. Strikingly, in contrast to the conventional paradigm we show a non-vanishing microwave absorption in flat band systems enabled by Bloch quantum geometry leading to superconducting gap enhancement, underscoring the band-geometric origin of nonequilibrium flat band superconductivity. Specifically, we demonstrate this in twisted bilayer graphene, a promising candidate material, and find significant gap enhancement near critical temperature. This work highlights that the nonequilibrium dynamics of materials with non-trivial flat bands as a promising area for future experimental and theoretical investigation.</description>

      <title>Ambient pressure high temperature superconductivity in RbPH$_3$ facilitated by ionic anharmonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent predictions of metastable high-temperature hydride superconductors give hope that superconductivity at ambient conditions is within reach. In this work, we predict RbPH$_3$ as a new compound with a superconducting critical temperature around 100 K at ambient pressure, dynamically stabilized thanks to ionic quantum anharmonic effects. RbPH$_3$ is thermodynamically stable at 30 GPa in a perovskite $Pm\bar{3}m$ phase, allowing its experimental synthesis at moderate pressures far from the megabar regime. With lowering pressure it is expected to transform to a $R3m$ phase that should stay dynamically stable thanks to quantum fluctuations down to ambient pressures. Both phases are metallic, with the $R3m$ phase having three distinct Fermi surfaces, composed mostly of states with phosphorus and hydrogen character. The structures are held together by strong P-H covalent bonds, resembling the pattern observed in the high-temperature superconducting H$_3$S, with extra electrons donated by rubidium. These results demonstrate that quantum ionic fluctuations, neglected thus far in high-throughput calculations, can stabilize at ambient pressure hydride superconductors with a high critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Negative Magnetoresistance in Layered AFM Semimetals: the Case of EuSn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, by applying a comprehensive approach including magnetic, transport measurements, ARPES band structure measurements, DFT calculations, and analytical theory consideration, we unveil the puzzling origin of the negative isotropic magnetoresistance in the highly anisotropic semimetals, particularly, Eu$_2$Sn$_2$As$_2$ with AFM ordering of Eu atoms. The isotropic magnetoresistance developing along with the magnetization changes up to the complete spin polarization field was reported previously in several experimental studies, though its theoretical explanation was missing up to date. Recently, we proposed a novel theoretical mechanism to describe the observed magnetoresistance in layered AFM compounds by exchange splitting of the electron energy levels and by confining the electron wave functions with different spin projection in the vicinity of the respective magnetic layer. In this paper, we present more detailed experimental studies of the negative magnetoresistance with several samples of EuSn$_2$As$_2$ in order to identify its sample-independent features including temperature dependence. We also substantiate the proposed theory by comparing it with magnetotransport data, with ARPES measurements of the energy band structure, and DFT energy spectrum calculations.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametrons in the MIT LL SFQ5ee+ Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic is a proven energy-efficient superconductor technology for various applications. To address the scalability challenges, we investigated AQFP shift registers with the AQFP footprint area reduced by 25% with respect to prior work and with more than 2x denser overall designs obtained by eliminating the previously used free space between the AQFPs. We also investigated AQFP cells with different designs of flux trapping moats in the superconducting ground plane as well as compact AQFP cells that took advantage of the smaller feature sizes available in the new fabrication process, SFQ5ee+, at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This new process features nine planarized Nb layers with a 0.25 $\mu$m minimum linewidth.
  The fabricated circuits were tested in a liquid He probe and in a closed-cycle cryocooler using a controlled cooling rate through the superconducting critical temperature. Using multiple thermal cycles, we investigated flux trapping in the dense AQFP shift registers as well as in the registers using the old (sparse) AQFP designs at two levels of the residual magnetic field, about 0.53 $\mu$T and about 1.2 $\mu$T. The sparse designs demonstrated 95% to almost 100% probability of operation after the cooldown and very wide operation margins, although the flux trapping probability was increasing with circuit complexities. The margins were similarly wide in the newer dense designs, but flux trapping probability that rendered the registers nonoperational was significantly, by an order of magnitude, higher in the denser circuits and was also very sensitive to the moats' shape and location.
  Our findings indicate that AQFP circuits are amendable to increasing the scale of integration and further densification, but a careful moat design and optimization are required to reduce flux trapping effects in the dense AQFP circuits.</description>

      <title>Phase transition on superfluid vortices in Higgs-Confinement crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to distinguish states of matter by identifying spontaneous symmetry breaking on extended objects, such as vortices, even in the absence of a bulk phase transition. As a specific example, we investigate the phase transition on superfluid vortices in the Higgs-confinement crossover using a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{gauge} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ model. This model exhibits superfluidity of $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{global}$ symmetry and allows for a crossover between the Higgs and confinement regimes by varying the gauge coupling constant from weak to strong. We demonstrate that, on vortices, spontaneous breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flavor symmetry occurs in the weak coupling (Higgs) regime, while it does not in the strong coupling (confinement) regime. We also confirm that those regimes are separated by a second-order phase transition through Monte Carlo simulations, whose universality class corresponds to the two-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and superconducting properties of LaNiO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent photoemission measurements on the La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$, we carry out a systematic study of the infinite-layer nickelate using both dynamical mean-field theory and density matrix embedding theory. The renormalized electronic structure and Fermi surface of correlated La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ are studied in an effective two-band model through the dynamical mean-field calculation. We find the correlation effects reflect mainly on the Ni $d$ band, which is consistent with the experimental findings. We further study the ground state including magnetism and superconductivity through the density matrix embedding theory. Within the experimental doping range and rigid-band approximation, we show that the $d$-wave superconductivity is the lowest energy state, while the static magnetism is absent except very close to zero doping. These findings provide a new understanding of infinite-layer nickelate superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of high electron-mobility, unpaired spins, and superconductivity at high carrier density SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $t_{2g}$ band-structure of SrTiO$_3$-based two-dimensional electron gasses (2DEGs), have been found to play a role in features such as the superconducting dome, high-mobility transport, and the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. This adds to the already very diverse range of phenomena, including magnetism and extreme magnetoresistance, exhibited by this particular material platform. Tuning and/or combining these intriguing attributes could yield significant progress within quantum and spintronics technologies. Doing so demands precise control of the parameters, which requires a better understanding of the factors that affect them. Here we present effects of the $t_{2g}$ band-order inversion, stemming from the growth of spinel-structured $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ onto perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Electronic transport measurements show that with LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ as the reference, the carrier density and electron mobility are enhanced, and the sample displays a reshaping of the superconducting dome. Additionally, unpaired spins are evidenced by increasing Anomalous Hall Effect with decreasing temperature, entering the same temperature range as the superconducting transition, and a Kondo-like upturn in the sheet resistance. Finally, it is argued that the high-mobility $d_{xz/yz}$-band is more likely than the $d_{xy}$-band to host the supercurrent.</description>

      <title>The $s^\pm$-Wave Superconductivity in the Pressurized La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, evidence of superconductivity (SC) has been reported in pressurized La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Here we study the possible pairing mechanism and pairing symmetry in this material. Through fitting the density-functional-theory band structure, we provide a six-orbital tight-binding model. In comparison with the band structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the additional non-bonding $d_{z^2}$ band is importance to the pairing mechanism here. When the multi-orbital Hubbard interactions are included, our random-phase-approximation based study yields an $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing. The dominant FS nesting with nesting vector $\mathbf{Q}_1\approx (\pi,\pi)$ is between the $\gamma$-pocket contributed by the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band top and the $\alpha_1$-pocket contributed by the non-bonding $d_{z^2}$ band bottom, leading to the strongest pairing gap amplitude and opposite gap signs within the two regimes. The dominant real-space pairing is the interlayer pairing between the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. We have also studied the doping dependence of the pairing symmetry and $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Topological incommensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductor and Bogoliubov Fermi surface in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a random phase approximation (RPA) calculation for a spin-valley polarized model of the rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene to study the possibility of chiral superconductor from the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. We included the realistic band structure and form factor in our calculation and solved the self-consistent equation numerically by sampling 20,000 points in the momentum space at a given temperature. Around the Van-Hove singularity (VHS), we find p-ip pairing with Chern number switching from $C=-1$ to $C=0$ through a gap closing at $\mathbf k=(0,0)$ (defined relative to $\mathbf K$). Although the superconductor is generically fully gapped at low temperature, we find Bogoliubov Fermi surface at temperature just below mean field $T_c$. Besides, through calculation of the free energy, we conclude that the optimal Cooper pair momentum $\mathbf Q$ is generically finite and can be as large as $0.1 k_F$. We dub the $\mathbf Q\neq 0$ phase as an incommensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(FFLO) superconductor to distinguish it from the $\mathbf Q=0$ phase. Compared to the $\mathbf Q=0$ phase, our incommensurate $\mathbf Q$ phase is a nematic superconductor if it is in the Fulde-Ferrell(FF) phase or exhibts charge density wave (CDW) if it is in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) phase. Our work demonstrates the rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene as a wonderful platform to explore Majorana zero-mode, FFLO physics and Bogoliubov fermi surface within one single platform.</description>

      <title>Emerging topological characterization in non-equilibrium states of quenched Kitaev chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological characteristics of quantum systems are typically determined by the closing of a gap, while the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) during quantum real-time evolution has emerged as a nonequilibrium analog to the quantum phase transition (QPT). In this paper, we illustrate that the system dynamics can be elucidated by considering the precession of a collection of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field based on the exact results of extended Kitaev chains. The topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number of the nonequilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of the DQPT arises from two perpendicular pseudo-spin vectors associated with the pre- and post-quenched Hamiltonians. Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of topological properties in driven quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for a holographic superconductor: Finite coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The holographic superconductor is the holographic dual of superconductors. We recently identified the dual Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors (arXiv:2207.07182 [hep-th]). However, the result is the strong coupling limit or the large-$N_c$ limit. A natural question is how the dual GL theory changes at finite coupling. We identify the dual GL theory for a minimal holographic superconductor at finite coupling (Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor), where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly. The GL parameter $\kappa$ increases at finite coupling, namely the system approaches a more Type-II superconductor like material. We also point out two potential problems in previous works: (1) the "naive" AdS/CFT dictionary, and (2) the condensate determined only from the GL potential terms. As a result, the condensate increases at finite coupling unlike common folklore.</description>
