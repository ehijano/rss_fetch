      <title>Pivoting through the chiral-clock family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Onsager algebra, invented to solve the two-dimensional Ising model, can be used to construct conserved charges for a family of integrable $N$-state chiral clock models. We show how it naturally gives rise to a "pivot" procedure for this family of chiral Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians have an anti-unitary CPT symmetry that when combined with the usual $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock symmetry gives a non-abelian dihedral symmetry group $D_{2N}$. We show that this symmetry gives rise to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order in this family for all even $N$, and representation-SPT (RSPT) physics for all odd $N$. The simplest such example is a next-nearest-neighbour chain generalising the spin-1/2 cluster model, an SPT phase of matter. We derive a matrix-product state representation of its fixed-point ground state along with the ensuing entanglement spectrum and symmetry fractionalisation. We analyse a rich phase diagram combining this model with the Onsager-integrable chiral Potts chain, and find trivial, symmetry-breaking and (R)SPT orders, as well as extended gapless regions. For odd $N$, the phase transitions are "unnecessarily" critical from the SPT point of view.</description>

      <title>Annealing-Assisted Column Generation for Inequality-Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines are expected to solve combinatorial optimization problems faster than the existing integer programming solvers. These problems, particularly those encountered in practical situations, typically involve inequality constraints. However, owing to the hardware limitations of the current Ising machines, solving combinatorial optimization problems with inequality constraints remains challenging. The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a typical example of a problem with inequality constraints. The objective function of the CVRP is to minimize the total distance traveled by each vehicle while limiting the total demand of customers served by a single vehicle to the vehicle's capacity. The CVRP is classified as NP-hard and, thus, is commonly solved using heuristic algorithms, such as column generation. Column generation attempts to iteratively generate only the promising routes, as the number of feasible routes increases exponentially. Within this framework, the CVRP is formulated as a set cover problem. The corresponding dual solutions are used to define the pricing subproblem, which is intended to create a new route. By applying Ising machines to this pricing subproblem, the overall computation time can be reduced. This study aims to solve combinatorial optimization problems with inequality constraints using a hybrid algorithm that combines column generation and Ising machines, thereby extending the applications of the latter. We parameterize the difficulty of the inequality constraints and demonstrate that our annealing-assisted column generation can converge to a better lower bound.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-transition between antiferromagnetic and charge orders in a minimal spin-pseudospin model of one-dimensional cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study rigorously investigates the phenomenon of a pseudo-transition in a minimal spinpseudospin model, serving as a simplified model of one-dimensional cuprate chains [CuO]n, by making use of the transfer-matrix method. The studied spin-pseudospin model of one-dimensional cuprate chains [CuO]n reveals a peculiar pseudo-transition between a charged-ordered phase and an antiferromagnetic phase, which is accompanied with anomalous behavior of magnetic and thermodynamic quantities. While the entropy and short-range correlations undergo near the pseudo-transition steep continuous changes reminiscent of a discontinuous phase transition, the specific heat displays a sizable sharp peak akin to a continuous phase transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetism in Fe2Cu2 Polymeric Branched Chains: Insights from Exactly Solved Ising-Heisenberg Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg branched chain, inspired by the magnetic structure of three isostructural polymeric coordination compounds [(Tp)2Fe2(CN)6X(bdmap)Cu2(H2O)].H2O to be further denoted as Fe2Cu2 (Tp = tris(pyrazolyl)hydroborate, bdmapH = 1,3-bis(dimethylamino)-2-propanol, HX = acetic acid, propionic acid or trifluoroacetic acid), is rigorously studied using the transfer-matrix method. The overall ground-state phase diagram reveals three distinct phases: a quantum antiferromagnetic phase, a quantum ferrimagnetic phase and a classical ferromagnetic phase. In the zero-temperature magnetization curve, two quantum ground states are manifested as intermediate plateaus at zero and half of the saturation magnetization, while the magnetization reaches its saturated value within the classical ferromagnetic phase. The bipartite entanglement between nearest-neighbor Heisenberg spins is more pronounced in the quantum ferrimagnetic phase compared to the quantum antiferromagnetic phase due to a fully polarized nature of the Ising spins. A reasonable agreement between theoretical predictions for the spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg branched chain and experimental data measured for a temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and a low-temperature magnetization curve suggests strong antiferromagnetic coupling between nearest-neighbor CuII-CuII magnetic ions and moderately strong ferromagnetic coupling between nearest-neighbor CuII-FeIII magnetic ions in the polymeric compounds Fe2Cu2. A thermal entanglement between nearest-neighbor CuII-CuII magnetic ions persists up to a relatively high threshold temperature T = 224 K and undergoes a transient magnetic-field-driven strengthening.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Micromagnetics with Spin Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetics interacting with a spin-current torque. We extend the previously constructed stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation to the case with spin-current torque, and verify the conditions of detailed balance. Then we construct various thermodynamics quantities such as work and heat, and prove the second law of thermodynamics. Due to the existence of spin-torque and the asymmetry of the kinetic matrix, a novel effect of entropy pumping shows up. As a consequence, the system may behave as a heat engine which constantly transforms heat into magnetic work. Finally, we derive a fluctuation theorem for the joint probability density function of the pumped entropy and the total work, and verify it using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamic Integration: Free Energies from Energy-based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic integration (TI) offers a rigorous method for estimating free-energy differences by integrating over a sequence of interpolating conformational ensembles. However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. In this work, we propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a denoising-diffusion objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles, allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI is capable of coupling hundreds of degrees of freedom at once.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Renormalization Group: An introduction to heterogeneous coarse-graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) constitutes a fundamental framework in modern theoretical physics. It allows the study of many systems showing states with large-scale correlations and their classification in a relatively small set of universality classes. RG is the most powerful tool for investigating organizational scales within dynamic systems. However, the application of RG techniques to complex networks has presented significant challenges, primarily due to the intricate interplay of correlations on multiple scales. Existing approaches have relied on hypotheses involving hidden geometries and based on embedding complex networks into hidden metric spaces. Here, we present a practical overview of the recently introduced Laplacian Renormalization Group for heterogeneous networks. First, we present a brief overview that justifies the use of the Laplacian as a natural extension for well-known field theories to analyze spatial disorder. We then draw an analogy to traditional real-space renormalization group procedures, explaining how the LRG generalizes the concept of "Kadanoff supernodes" as block nodes that span multiple scales. These supernodes help mitigate the effects of cross-scale correlations due to small-world properties. Additionally, we rigorously define the LRG procedure in momentum space in the spirit of Wilson RG. Finally, we show different analyses for the evolution of network properties along the LRG flow following structural changes when the network is properly reduced.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Newtonian Deterministic Causality from Stochastic Motions in Continuous Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Newton's time, deterministic causality has been considered a crucial prerequisite in any fundamental theory in physics. In contrast, the present work investigates stochastic dynamical models for motion in one spatial dimension, in which Newtonian mechanics becomes an emergent property: We present a coherent theory in which a Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) emerges in a description of the evolution of entropy $-\phi(x,t)=\epsilon \log$(Probability) of a system under observation and in the limit of large information extent $\epsilon^{-1}$ in homogeneous space and time. The variable $\phi$ represents a non-random high-order statistical concept that is distinct from probability itself as $\epsilon=0$; the HJE embodies an emergent law of deterministic causality in continuous space and time with an Imaginary Scale symmetry $(t,x,\phi)\leftrightarrow (it,ix,i\phi)$. $\phi(x,t)$ exhibits a nonlinear wave phenomenon with a mathematical singularity in finite time, overcoming which we introduce viscosity $\epsilon(\partial^2\phi/\partial x^2)$ and wave $i\epsilon(\partial^2 \phi/\partial x^2)$ perturbations, articulating dissipation and conservation, which break the Imaginary Scale symmetry: They lead to the Brownian motion and Schr\"{o}dinger's equation of motion, respectively. Last but not least, Lagrange's action in classical mechanics acquires an entropic interpretation and Hamilton's principle is established.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schr\"odinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value -- their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: in what sense does the entropy of an isolated quantum system increase over time? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the equilibration on average of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well-established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends towards its equilibrium value in the course of the system's unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings which question the necessity of non-integrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory of $\text{SO}(2N)\rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and study the relativistic Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the $\text{SO}(2N)$ real symmetric second-rank tensor order parameter coupled to $N_f$ flavors of $4N$-component Majorana fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Such a tensor order parameter unifies all Lorentz-invariant mass-gap orders for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in two dimensions except for the $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet anomalous quantum Hall state. The value $N_f=1$ corresponds to the canonical Gross-Neveu model. Within the leading-order $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension of $3+1$ the field theory exhibits a critical fixed point in its renormalization group flow which describes spontaneous symmetry breaking to $\text{SO}(N)\times \text{SO}(N)$ for the number of flavors of Majorana fermions higher than a critical value $N_{f,c2}\approx 2N$. For $N_{f, c1}&lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ , with $N_{f,c1} \approx 1.080 N$ the critical fixed point resides in the unstable region of the theory where the effective potential is unbounded from below, whereas for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1}$ there is no real critical fixed point, and the flow runs away. In either case, for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ the transition should become fluctuation-induced first-order, and we discuss the dependence of its size on the parameters in the theory. One-loop critical exponents for the new universality class at $N_{f, c2}&lt; N_f $ are computed and the flow diagram in various regimes is discussed.</description>

      <title>Prethermal Time-Crystalline Corner Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of prethermal discrete time crystals whose sub-harmonic response is entirely localized to zero-dimensional corner modes. Within the exponentially long prethermal regime, we show that the robustness of these corner modes arises from two related, yet distinct mechanisms: the presence of a higher-order symmetry-protected topological phase in the effective Hamiltonian, or the emergence of a dynamical constraint that prevents the decay of the corner mode. While the first mechanism ensures the stability of the sub-harmonic response throughout the entirety of the prethermal regime, it is restricted to initial states in the ground state manifold of the effective Hamiltonian. By contrast, the second mechanism enables the observation of the prethermal time-crystalline order for arbitrary initial states, albeit with a time scale that is not only determined by the frequency of the drive, but also the relative energy scale across the system's sublattices. We characterize these two mechanisms by simulating the dynamics of a periodically driven two-dimensional spin model, and discuss natural extensions of our model to all other dimensions.</description>

      <title>Counting and Hardness-of-Finding Fixed Points in Cellular Automata on Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fixed points of outer-totalistic cellular automata on sparse random regular graphs. These can be seen as constraint satisfaction problems, where each variable must adhere to the same local constraint, which depends solely on its state and the total number of its neighbors in each possible state. Examples of this setting include classical problems such as independent sets or assortative/dissasortative partitions. We analyse the existence and number of fixed points in the large system limit using the cavity method, under both the replica symmetric (RS) and one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) assumption. This method allows us to characterize the structure of the space of solutions, in particular, if the solutions are clustered and whether the clusters contain frozen variables. This last property is conjectured to be linked to the typical algorithmic hardness of the problem. We bring experimental evidence for this claim by studying the performance of the belief-propagation reinforcement algorithm, a message-passing-based solver for these constraint satisfaction problems.</description>

      <title>Gifts from long-range interaction: Emergent gapless topological behaviors in quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology in condensed matter physics is typically associated with a bulk energy gap. However, recent research has shifted focus to topological phases without a bulk energy gap, exhibiting nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. In this letter, we explore a cluster Ising chain with long-range antiferromagnetic interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Using complementary numerical and analytical techniques, we demonstrate that long-range interactions can unambiguously induce an algebraic topological phase and a topological Gaussian universality, both of which exhibit nontrivial gapless topological behaviors. Our study not only provides a platform to investigate the fundamental physics of quantum many-body systems but also offers a novel route toward searching for gapless topological phases in realistic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous nucleation for two-dimensional Kawasaki dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the third in a series of three papers in which we study a lattice gas subject to Kawasaki dynamics at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ in a large finite box $\Lambda_\beta \subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ whose volume depends on $\beta$. Each pair of neighbouring particles has a negative binding energy $-U&lt;0$, while each particle has a positive activation energy $\Delta&gt;0$. The initial configuration is drawn from the grand-canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is to describe, in the metastable regime $\Delta \in (U,2U)$ and in the limit as $\beta\to\infty$, how and when the system nucleates, i.e., creates a critical droplet somewhere in $\Lambda_\beta$ that subsequently grows by absorbing particles from the surrounding gas.
  In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the second paper we used the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when the volume is moderately large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\theta\beta}$ with $\Delta &lt; \theta &lt; 2\Delta-U$. In the present paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Delta &lt; \Theta &lt; \Gamma-(2\Delta-U)$, where $\Gamma$ is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time and the tube of typical trajectories towards nucleation. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation. One of the key ingredients in the proof is an estimate showing that no information can travel between these boxes on relevant time scales.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature entanglement of the nickel-radical molecular complex (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bipartite entanglement is comprehensively investigated in the mononuclear molecular complex (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L]L, where HL denotes 2-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-nitrophenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-3-oxide-1-oxyl and hfacH stands for hexafluoroacetylacetone. From the magnetic point of view, the molecular compound (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L] consists of an exchange-coupled spin-1 Ni2+ magnetic ion and a spin-1/2 nitronyl-nitroxide radical substituted nitrophenol. The nickel-radical molecular complex affords an experimental realization of a mixed spin-(1/2, 1) Heisenberg dimer with a strong antiferromagnetic exchange coupling J/kB = 505 K and two distinct g-factors gRad=2.005 and gNi=2.275. By adopting this set of magnetic parameters we demonstrate that the Zeeman splitting of a quantum ferrimagnetic ground-state doublet due to a weak magnetic field may substantially reinforce the strength of bipartite entanglement at low temperatures. The molecular compound (Et3NH)[Ni(hfac)2L] maintains sufficiently strong thermal entanglement even at room temperature, vanishing only above 546 K. Specifically, the thermal entanglement in the nickel-radical molecular complex retains approximately 40% of the maximum value corresponding to perfectly entangled Bell states at room temperature, which implies that this magnetic compound provides suitable platform of a molecular qubit with potential implications for room-temperature quantum computation and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamical models from stochastic trajectories</title>

Abstract: The dynamics of biological systems, from proteins to cells to organisms, is complex and stochastic. To decipher their physical laws, we need to bridge between experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Thanks to progress in microscopy and tracking, there is today an abundance of experimental trajectories reflecting these dynamical laws. Inferring physical models from noisy and imperfect experimental data, however, is challenging. Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates. I finally present early applications of these techniques, as well as future research directions.</description>

      <title>Universal limiting behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems with conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making sense of complex inhomogeneous systems composed of many interacting species is a grand challenge that pervades basically all natural sciences. Phase separation and pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems have largely been studied as two separate paradigms. Here we show that in reaction-diffusion systems composed of many species, the presence of a conservation law constrains the evolution of the conserved quantity to be governed by a Cahn-Hilliard-like equation. This establishes a direct link with the paradigm of coexistence and recent "active" field theories. Hence, even for complex many-species systems a dramatically simplified but accurate description emerges over coarse spatio-temporal scales. Using the nullcline (the line of homogeneous steady states) as the central motif, we develop a geometrical framework through endowing chemical space with a basis and suitable coordinates. This framework allows us to capture and understand the effect of eliminating fast non-conserved degrees of freedom, and to explicitly construct coefficients of the coarse field theory. We expect that the theory we develop here will be particularly relevant to advance our understanding of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Aging properties of the voter model with long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the aging properties of the one-dimensional voter model with long-range interactions in its ordering kinetics. In this system, an agent $S_i=\pm 1$ positioned at a lattice vertex $i$, copies the state of another one located at a distance $r$, selected randomly with a probability $P(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$. Employing both analytical and numerical methods, we compute the two-time correlation function $G(r;t,s)$ ($t\ge s$) between the state of a variable $S_i$ at time $s$ and that of another one, at distance $r$, at time $t$. At time $t$, the memory of an agent of its former state at time $s$, expressed by the {\it autocorrelation function} $A(t,s)=G(r=0;t,s)$, decays algebraically for $\alpha &gt;1$ as $[L(t)/L(s)]^{-\lambda}$, where $L$ is a time-increasing coherence length and $\lambda $ is the Fisher-Huse exponent. We find $\lambda =1$ for $\alpha &gt;2$, and $\lambda =1/(\alpha-1)$ for $1&lt;\alpha \le 2$. For $\alpha \le 1$, instead, there is an exponential decay, as in mean-field. Then, at variance with what is known for the related Ising model, here we find that $\lambda $ increases upon decreasing $\alpha$. The space-dependent correlation $G(r;t,s)$ obeys a scaling symmetry $G(r;t,s)=g[r/L(s);L(t)/L(s)]$ for $\alpha &gt;2$. Similarly, for $1&lt;\alpha \le 2$ one has $G(r;t,s)=g[r/{\cal L}(t);{\cal L}(t)/{\cal L}(s)] $, where now the length ${\cal L}$ regulating two-time correlations differs from the coherence length as ${\cal L}\propto L^\delta$, with $\delta=1+2(2-\alpha)$.</description>

      <title>Time irreversibility in Statistical Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the important questions in statistical mechanics is how irreversibility (time's arrow) occurs when Newton equations of motion are time reversal invariant. One objection to irreversibility is based on Poincar\'e's recursion theorem: a classical hamiltonian confined system returns after some time, so-called Poincar\'e recurrence time (PRT), close to its initial configuration. Boltzmann's reply was that for a $N \sim 10^{23} $ macroscopic number of particles, PRT is very large and exceeds the age of the universe. In this paper we compute for the first time, using molecular dynamics, a typical recurrence time $ T(N)$ for a realistic case of a gas of $N$ particles. We find that $T(N) \sim N^z \exp (y N) $ and determine the exponents $y$ and $z$ for different values of the particle density and temperature. We also compute $y$ analytically using Boltzmann's hypotheses.
  We find an excellent agreement with the numerical results.
  This agreement validates Boltzmann's hypotheses which are not yet mathematically proven. We establish that that $T(N) $ exceeds the age of the Universe for a relatively small number of particles, much smaller than $ 10^{23} $.</description>

      <title>Microscopic understanding of NMR signals by dynamic mean-field theory for spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently developed dynamic mean-field theory for disordered spins (spinDMFT) is shown to capture the spin dynamics of nuclear spins very well. The key quantities are the spin autocorrelations. In order to compute the free induction decay (FID), pair correlations are needed in addition. They can be computed on spin clusters of moderate size which are coupled to the dynamic mean fields determined in a first step by spinDMFT. We dub this versatile approach non-local spinDMFT (nl-spinDMFT). It is a particular asset of nl-spinDMFT that one knows from where the contributions to the FID stem. We illustrate the strengths of nl-spinDMFT in comparison to experimental data for CaF$_2$. Furthermore, spinDMFT provides the dynamic mean fields explaining the FID of the nuclear spins of $^{13}$C in adamantane up to some static noise. The spin Hahn echo in adamantane is free from effects of static noise and agrees excellently with the spinDMFT results without further fitting.</description>

      <title>Effect of constraint relaxation on dynamic critical phenomena in minimum vertex cover problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of constraint relaxation on dynamic critical phenomena in the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs are investigated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Following our previous work that revealed the reduction of the critical temperature by constraint relaxation based on the penalty function method, this study focuses on investigating the critical properties of the relaxation time along its phase boundary. It is found that the dynamical correlation function of MVC with respect to the problem size and the constraint strength follows a universal scaling function. The analysis shows that the relaxation time decreases as the constraints are relaxed. This decrease is more pronounced for the critical amplitude than for the critical exponent, and this result is interpreted in terms of the system's microscopic energy barriers due to the constraint relaxation.</description>

      <title>Droplet dynamics in a two-dimensional rarefied gas under Kawasaki dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of three papers in which we study a lattice gas subject to Kawasaki conservative dynamics at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ in a large finite box $\Lambda_\beta \subset\mathbb Z^2$ whose volume depends on $\beta$. Each pair of neighbouring particles has a negative binding energy $-U&lt;0$, while each particle has a positive activation energy $\Delta&gt;0$. The initial configuration is drawn from the grand-canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is to describe, in the metastable regime $\Delta\in(U,2U)$ and in the limit as $\beta\to\infty$, how and when the system nucleates.
  In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the present paper we use the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when the volume is moderately large, i.e., $|\Lambda_\beta|=\mathrm e^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Delta&lt;\Theta&lt;2\Delta-U$. In the third paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta|=\mathrm e^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Delta&lt;\Theta&lt;\Gamma-(2\Delta-U)$, where $\Gamma$ is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation.
  Since Kawasaki dynamics is conservative, i.e., particles are preserved, we need to control non-local effects in the way droplets are formed and dissolved. This is done via a deductive approach: the tube of typical trajectories leading to nucleation is described via a series of events on which the evolution of the gas consists of droplets wandering around on multiple space-time scales.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the (classical) inception score (cIS). In this paper, as a natural extension of cIS, we propose the quantum inception score (qIS) for quantum generators. Importantly, qIS relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. In this context, we show several properties of qIS. First, qIS is greater than or equal to the corresponding cIS, which is defined through projection measurements on the system output. Second, the difference between qIS and cIS arises from the presence of quantum coherence, as characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry. Third, when a set of entangled generators is prepared, there exists a classifying process leading to the further enhancement of qIS. Fourth, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of qIS. Finally, we apply qIS to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.</description>

Abstract: Studies of the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to baths are typically performed by utilizing the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel (${\mathcal{K}}$) or the influence functions ($\mathbf{{I}}$), especially when the dynamics exhibit memory effects (i.e., non-Markovian). Despite their significance, the formal connection between the memory kernel and the influence functions has not been explicitly made. We reveal their relation by inspecting the system propagator for a broad class of problems where an $N$-level system is linearly coupled to Gaussian baths (bosonic, fermionic, and spin.) With this connection, we also show how approximate path integral methods can be understood in terms of approximate memory kernels. For a certain class of open quantum system problems, we devised a non-perturbative, diagrammatic approach to construct ${\mathcal{K}}$ from $\mathbf{{I}}$ for (driven) systems interacting with Gaussian baths without the use of any projection-free dynamics inputs required by standard approaches. Lastly, we demonstrate a Hamiltonian learning procedure to extract the bath spectral density from a set of reduced system trajectories obtained experimentally or by numerically exact methods, opening new avenues in quantum sensing and engineering. The insights we provide in this work will significantly advance the understanding of non-Markovian dynamics, and they will be an important stepping stone for theoretical and experimental developments in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning algorithm to infer the emergent stochastic equation governing the evolution of an order parameter of a many-body system. We train our neural network to independently learn the directed force acting on the order parameter as well as an effective diffusive noise. We illustrate our approach using the classical Ising model endowed with Glauber dynamics, and the contact process as test cases. For both models, which represent paradigmatic equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios, the directed force and noise can be efficiently inferred. The directed force term of the Ising model allows us to reconstruct an effective potential for the order parameter which develops the characteristic double-well shape below the critical temperature. Despite its genuine nonequilibrium nature, such an effective potential can also be obtained for the contact process and its shape signals a phase transition into an absorbing state. Also, in contrast to the equilibrium Ising model, the presence of an absorbing state renders the noise term dependent on the value of the order parameter itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying complexity in quantum systems has witnessed a surge of interest in recent years, with Krylov-based measures such as Krylov complexity ($C_K$) and Spread complexity ($C_S$) gaining prominence. In this study, we investigate their interplay by considering the complexity of states represented by density matrix operators. After setting up the problem, we analyze a handful of analytical and numerical examples spanning generic two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, qubit states, quantum harmonic oscillators, and random matrix theories, uncovering insightful relationships. For generic pure states, our analysis reveals two key findings: (I) a correspondence between moment-generating functions (of Lanczos coefficients) and survival amplitudes, and (II) an early-time equivalence between $C_K$ and $2C_S$. Furthermore, for maximally entangled pure states, we find that the moment-generating function of $C_K$ becomes the Spectral Form Factor and, at late-times, $C_K$ is simply related to $NC_S$ for $N\geq2$ within the $N$-dimensional Hilbert space. Notably, we confirm that $C_K = 2C_S$ holds across all times when $N=2$. Through the lens of random matrix theories, we also discuss deviations between complexities at intermediate times and highlight subtleties in the averaging approach at the level of the survival amplitude.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using online SGD grows as $d^{p-1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to weakly-recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical learning in neural networks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate the averages of conserved densities and currents associated to charges of generic spin in (1+1)-dimensional massive integrable Quantum Field Theories perturbed by the irrelevant $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ operator. By making use of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach and of the theory of Generalised Hydrodynamics, we study the non-equilibrium steady state averages of conserved densities and currents in a partitioning protocol. We show that in particular limits, averages can be evaluated exactly in terms of quantities known from the unperturbed theory. In the massless limit we recover known results for the energy and momentum currents and generalise those to any higher spin conserved quantities. We extend some of our results to perturbations of the generalised $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ type. For the massive free fermion theory, we find an analytic expression for the effective inverse temperature after at $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ perturbation in terms of the bare inverse temperature by making use of Lambert's $W$ function.</description>

Abstract: We study the O($N$)$^*$ transitions that occur in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge $N$-vector model, and the analogous Ising$^*$ transitions occurring in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge Higgs model, corresponding to an $N$-vector model with $N=1$. At these transitions, gauge-invariant correlations behave as in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. Instead, the nongauge invariant spin correlations are trivial and therefore the spin order parameter that characterizes the spontaneous breaking of the O($N$) symmetry in standard $N$-vector/Ising systems is apparently absent. We define a novel gauge fixing procedure -- we name it stochastic gauge fixing -- that allows us to define a gauge-dependent vector field that orders at the transition and is therefore the appropriate order parameter for the O($N$) symmetry breaking. To substantiate this approach, we perform numerical simulations for $N=3$ and $N=1$. A finite-size scaling analysis of the numerical data allows us to confirm the general scenario: the gauge-fixed spin correlation functions behave as the corresponding functions computed in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. The emergence of a critical vector order parameter in the gauge model shows the complete equivalence of the O($N$)$^*$/Ising$^*$ and O($N$)/Ising universality classes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunneling Could Enable Proton Transfer Reactions on Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is rich in organics and is often suggested to model early Earth environments. Titan's surface is cold, at a temperature of approximately 90 K, which prohibits most thermally activated chemical reactions. However, quantum effects become more important at low temperatures and reactions that are classically prohibited can often proceed through quantum mechanical pathways. Using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate nuclear quantum effects on the thermodynamics of model proton transfer reactions in liquid ethane. We find that proton transfer can occur at Titan surface conditions through quantum tunneling. Consequently, we estimate that nuclear quantum effects can enhance reaction rates by many orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that nuclear quantum effects could facilitate prebiotic chemistry on Titan, and quantum effects should be considered in future investigations.</description>
