      <title>AI-Assisted Hyperspectral Interferometry and Single-Cell Dispersion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometry techniques are essential for extracting phase information from optical systems, enabling precise measurements of dispersion and highly sensitive detection of perturbations. While phase sensing offers enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional spectroscopy methods, this sensitivity often makes systems more vulnerable to external factors such as vibrations, introducing instability and noise. In this work, we demonstrate a broadband and AI-enhanced interferometry method, denoted general polarization common-path interferometry (GPCPI), that relaxes the polarization constraints of traditional common-path interferometry. The polarization decoupling feature enables simultaneous amplitude and phase measurements supplemented with deep neural autoencoders to detect phase anomalies in the spectrum through the analysis of second order derivative mapping of the phase profile, enhancing the accuracy of broadband phase measurements. The approach enables an order of magnitude improvement in phase stability compared to state-of-the-art interferometry techniques, leading to higher accuracy in phase sensing. Plasmonic metasurface phase sensing and hyperspectral single-cell dispersion imaging demonstrate the capability and sensitivity of the method over conventional spectroscopy. Our own adopted version of deep learning model, ConvNeXt V2, enables single-shot and real-time tracking of phase variation with minimized noise. Interference fringes over the cell cultured samples reveal the fingerprints of the normal (CCD-32Sk) vs cancerous (COLO-829) skin cells, enabling robust cell classification and disease diagnosis at single-cell level. The proposed interferometry technique offers a reliable, compact, and stable solution for broadband phase measurements and single-cell dispersion imaging for applications in metrology, molecular diagnostics, drug discovery, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Silicon-on-sapphire metasurfaces generate arrays of dark and bright traps for neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrated crystalline silicon-on-sapphire (c-SOS) metasurfaces that convert a Gaussian beam into arrays of complex optical traps, including arrays of optical bottle beams that trap atoms in dark regions interleaved with bright tweezer arrays. The high refractive index and indirect band gap of crystalline silicon makes it possible to design high-resolution near-infrared ($\lambda&gt;700$ nm) metasurfaces that can be manufactured at scale using CMOS-compatible processes. Compared with active components like spatial light modulators (SLMs) that have become widely used to generate trap arrays, metasurfaces provide an indefinitely scalable number of pixels, enabling large arrays of complex traps in a very small form factor, as well as reduced dynamic noise. To design metasurfaces that can generate three-dimensional bottle beams to serve as dark traps, we modified the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to enforce complex-amplitude profiles at the focal plane of the metasurface and to optimize the uniformity of the traps across the array. We fabricated and measured c-SOS metasurfaces that convert a Gaussian laser beam into arrays of bright traps, dark traps, and interleaved bright/dark traps.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-based Terahertz Three-dimensional Holography Enabled by Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence, an emerging, powerful and efficient computational tool, has played a crucial role in the design of optical devices. For the design of holographic metasurfaces, traditional algorithms require multiple iterations between the metasurface and target planes, resulting in excessive computation time. Here, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for the fast design of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) holographic metasurfaces. Trained in a self-supervised manner, the PINN eliminates the need for paired input-label datasets. After training, the PINN enables end-to-end mapping between the target holographic patterns and metasurface structures. Both simulation and experimental results of single-plane and 3D multi-plane holography demonstrate that metasurfaces designed by PINN offer higher imaging quality than traditional iterative algorithms. Moreover, the PINN can find approximate solutions of metasurface structures even in physically counterintuitive scenarios, where the holographic patterns of two parallel imaging planes are completely distinct. Furthermore, the inference process of PINN typically takes less than 1 second, much faster than the traditional algorithms requiring iterative computation. Notably, the PINN simultaneously accounts for both phase and amplitude modulation, thereby outperforming traditional phase-only modulation algorithms in handling complex physical scenarios and offering superior imaging quality. This end-to-end design approach has the potential to pave the way for the realization of high-quality, real-time, and large-scale terahertz 3D holographic display technology.</description>

      <title>Quaternion optical computing chip for parallel high-dimensional data processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing chips have emerged as a transformative computing technology due to their high computational density, low energy consumption, and compact footprint. While real- and complex-valued computing chips have been well developed, their fundamental limitations in representing high-dimensional data significantly constrain their applicability in modern signal processing. Quaternions enable direct operations on three- and four-dimensional data, powering high-dimensional processing in data analytics and artificial intelligence. Here we demonstrate a quaternion optical computing chip (QOCC) for the first time and benchmark its performance in several typical application scenarios: three-dimensional point cloud processing, RGB chromatic transformation, and quaternion convolutional neural network for color image recognition. The QOCC harnesses high parallelism of light by wavelength-division multiplexing, processing high-dimensional data simultaneously through multiple optical wavelength channels. Compared to the electronic computing counterpart, our QOCC achieves higher computational fidelity (root mean square error &lt; 0.035) and substantially reduced computational load (2/3 lower). It paves the way towards next-generation optical computing, overcoming the limitations of traditional computing systems in high-dimensional data processing.</description>

      <title>Programmable calculus operations in electromagnetic space using space-time-coding metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of metasurfaces and the increasing demand for programmable metasurfaces to simplify information systems, wave-based computation using metasurfaces has emerged as an attractive research topic. To facilitate the mathematical operations in electromagnetic (EM) space, here we propose a space-time coding metasurface (STCM) system capable of directly performing calculus operations on the spatial energy distributions of EM waves. By exploiting harmonic characteristics induced by time-varying coding, the responses of meta-atoms at specific harmonics can be flexibly controlled, which enables the metasurface system to address more complex tasks. Owing to its programmability, the STCM can dynamically switch functions in real time to accommodate different calculus tasks. To fully leverage the capability of STCM, we not only present the space-time coding sequences for differentiation and integration of EM waves, but also develop and numerically simulate the space-time coding sequences that can independently and simultaneously implement different calculus operations on the same incident EM waves. To experimentally validate the feasibility of the EM calculus operations, proof-of-concept experiments are conducted using a programmable 2-bit STCM. Good agreements among the theory, numerical simulations, and experiments confirm the feasibility of performing calculus operations in the EM space and demonstrate the broad application prospects of STCM in EM wave manipulations, wireless communications, and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Programmable ultra-broadband photonic chaos platform enabled by microwave-chaos-driven electro-optic frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical chaos holds great promise for secure communication, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning. However, its scalability has long been constrained by an intrinsic trade-off between bandwidth and the number of parallel chaotic channels. Here, we introduce a programmable "chaos-on-comb" architecture that overcomes this limitation using standard electro-optic components. By heterodyning a delayed-feedback chaotic laser with a continuous-wave reference, a broadband chaotic microwave signal is generated to simultaneously drive a cascaded electro-optic comb, imprinting chaotic dynamics across all comb lines and merging them into an ultra-broadband chaotic continuum. Then, incorporating spectrum slicing enables flexible extraction of parallel chaotic channels with preserved statistical independence and per-channel programmability. As a result, we demonstrate a single-channel ultra-broadband optical chaos with an effective bandwidth of 543.8 GHz, and a broadband terahertz noise source with an excess noise ratio of 52.99 \pm 2.85 dB to validate its flatness. Furthermore, we employ the uncorrelated parallel chaos for ultrafast photonic decision-making in a 256-armed bandit problem, achieving a favourable power-law scaling exponent of 0.86. Our work paves the way toward programmable, reconfigurable, and application-ready photonic chaos systems.</description>

      <title>Modal Analysis of Gyrotropic Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the modal analysis of open gyrotropic waveguides (GWs). The GWs consist of a non-circular gyrotropic (i.e., gyroelectric and gyromagnetic) core and an infinitely extending isotropic cladding. To solve this problem, we develop two independent full-wave methods. The first technique is an extended integral equation (EIE) method, an extension of a previously developed EIE used to calculate the propagation constants in composite dielectric-isotropic waveguides. The second technique is a Chebyshev expansion method (CEM). In both implementations, the electric and magnetic fields in the gyrotropic core are expanded in superpotential-based cylindrical vector wave functions (SUPER-CVWFs), recently developed for the problem of oblique multiple scattering by gyrotropic cylinders. Both techniques allow us to calculate the propagation constants in the general case, without approximations. Various non-circular gyrotropic waveguides are considered. The EIE and CEM results are validated against a commercial finite element solver, and the accuracy and computational performance of both methods are benchmarked. A microwave application is presented where the complex propagation constants of ferrite rods are computed in the presence of an external magnetic flux density bias. Our work advances the theory of propagation in open waveguides, from dielectric/isotropic to gyrotropic ones, and enables the design of contemporary waveguiding structures.</description>

      <title>Variational treatment of the electromagnetic field in an optical cavity with a moving mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical cavities with moving mirrors provide a versatile platform for exploring radiation-matter interactions and optically mediated mechanical effects, whose control has wide technological implications. However, capturing the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic field and of the mirror within a consistent theoretical framework remains challenging. We analyze the problem of the coupling between classical electromagnetic fields in a cavity and a movable mirror, considering both nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes of motion. Starting from the equations of motion for a mirror subject to a generic external potential, we provide a variational formulation of the mirror-radiation interaction. Within this framework, a single-mode variational approximation is introduced, which captures the essential dynamical features of the coupled system. In the special case of a mirror undergoing free motion, the variational method yields an exact solution. This unified treatment highlights the connection between different dynamical regimes and provides a basis for analyzing applications ranging from precision interferometry to relativistic radiation-pressure effects.</description>

      <title>An Ingestible Light Source for Deep Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography leverages ultrasound's deep tissue penetration to retrieve optical absorption contrast well beyond the optical diffusion limit. Conventional photoacoustic systems rely on externally delivered light and are therefore constrained by optical attenuation, limiting imaging depths to several centimeters. Here, we overcome this constraint using a compact, acoustically powered device that provides optical excitation directly from within the target medium. By exploiting the weak attenuation of low-MHz ultrasound, acoustic energy is transmitted through tissue to wirelessly power a pulsed laser diode. The emitted light pulses generate photoacoustic signals that encode local optical absorption at clinically relevant depths, which could enable imaging in regions such as the gastrointestinal tract that are inaccessible to surface-based illumination. We demonstrate this approach by imaging through a 12 cm thick phantom, establishing a pathway toward deep-tissue photoacoustic imaging.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Deep Learning with Quantum Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of deep neural networks comes at the cost of unsustainable power consumption. While optical neural networks offer an alternative, their capabilities remain constrained by the lack of efficient optical nonlinearities. To address this, we propose an all-optical deep learning architecture by embedding quantum emitters in inverse-designed nanophotonic structures. Due to their saturability, quantum emitters exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinearity compared with conventional materials. Using physics-aware training, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture can solve complex tasks, including nonlinear classification and reinforcement learning, which have not been realized in all-optical neural networks. To enable fair comparison across different platforms, we introduce a framework that quantitatively links nonlinearity to a network's expressive power. Analysis shows that our quantum activation, operating below nW/{\mu}m^2 intensity, reduces the power budget by seven orders of magnitude. System-level estimates show that the optical power required for large language models scales sublinearly with model size, enabling watt-level operation. Our results indicate that quantum nanophotonics provides a route toward sustainable AI inference.</description>

      <title>Controllable Lateral Optical Forces on Janus Particles in Fluid Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical forces - studied since the earliest days of laser physics - continue to reveal rich dynamics and enable powerful tools for manipulation of objects on micro- and nanoscales, and even individual atoms. Lateral optical forces, which act perpendicular to the direction of beam propagation, are particularly intriguing but have largely been restricted to interface geometries such as air - water boundaries. Here, we realize tunable lateral optical force entirely within a fluid environment by using Janus particles: dielectric microspheres half-coated with gold. We show that the lateral optical force arises from scattering asymmetry induced by the asymmetric structure of the particles; it can be tuned by adjusting the polarization angle of a linearly polarized beam, but also particle parameters including their size and orientation. Experimentally, we directly observe fully reversible lateral propulsion of Janus particles in water merely by rotating the polarization direction, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a new mechanism for programmable, polarization-controlled optical manipulation, with promising implications for biophotonics, microfluidics, and active soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions and Topological Protection in Anyonic-PT-Symmetric Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-time (PT) symmetry and anti-PT symmetry have attracted extensive interest for their non-Hermitian spectral properties, particularly the emergence of purely real and imaginary eigenvalues in their symmetry-unbroken regime, respectively. Recently, these two scenarios have been unified under a more general framework known as anyonic-PT symmetry, yet its physical implications in waveguide platforms and corresponding topological features in extended lattice systems remain largely unexplored. Here, the phase transitions and topological protection in anyonic-PT-symmetric systems are systematically investigated in waveguide lattices. In the symmetry-unbroken regime, the arguments of all bulk eigenvalues are constrained to two discrete values separated by {\pi}, leading to distinctive oscillatory propagation dynamics accompanied by controlled amplification or dissipation. In the case of one-dimensional lattice, the energy bands exhibit a gap closing and reopening during phase transition. Moreover, in the symmetry-unbroken regime, the topological edge states emerge within the bulk gap and are protected by a generalized pseudo-anyonic-Hermiticity (PAH) symmetry. Our results establish anyonic-PT symmetry as a new tunable degree of freedom for non-Hermitian waveguide systems, where the eigenvalue argument provides a natural quantity for information encoding. This work broadens the conceptual foundation of topological protection under generalized non-Hermitian symmetries.</description>

      <title>Subsymmetry-protected compact edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-symmetry (SubSy) protected topological states represent a concept that goes beyond the conventional framework of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, demonstrating that topological boundary states can remain robust even when the pertinent symmetry holds only in a subset of Hilbert space. Typical SPT and SubSy boundary states decay exponentially into the bulk, which means they are not confined in just few lattice sites close to the boundary. Here, we introduce topologically compact edge states protected by SubSy, featuring extreme two-site localization at boundaries of a lattice, without any decay into the bulk. The compactness arises from local destructive interference at the boundary, while topological protection is ensured by SubSy, characterized by quantized winding numbers. Experimentally, we observe compact edge states in laser-written photonic lattices with engineered rhombic-like unit cells, confirming their robustness against perturbations under both chiral symmetry and SubSy conditions. Our results highlight the potential of SubSy protection for achieving topological confinement of light, paving the way for applications in compact waveguides, lasers, and high-sensitivity photonic sensors.</description>

      <title>Deep-Subwavelength Plasmon Polariton Atomic Cavity Detector for Frequency- and Polarization-Sensitive Terahertz Detection and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room-temperature, miniaturized, polarization-resolved terahertz (THz) detection of high speed is vital for high-resolution imaging in radar, remote sensing, and semiconductor inspection, and is essential for large-scale THz focal plane arrays. However, miniaturization below deep-subwavelength scales (&lt; 1/50 wavelength) remain challenging due to weak light-matter interaction, which degrades responsivity and polarization sensitivity. Here, we present a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) monolithic detector that overcomes this limitation by maintaining and even enhancing performance at a deep-subwavelength channel length of just 2 micrometers (1/60 wavelength). The device integrates graphene rectangle PPAC arrays with dissimilar metal contacts, where graphene functions as both absorber and conductor, simplifying the architecture. Exploiting plasmon polariton resonances and the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect, the detector achieves polarization-sensitive, frequency-selective, and fast THz detection spanning 0.53 to 4.24 THz with a polarization ratio of 93, featuring a responsivity (RV) of 1007 V/W, a noise-equivalent power (NEP) of 16 pW/Hz^0.5, a specific detectivity (D*) of 2.9 x 10^7 Jones, and a response time of 230 ps. We further demonstrate monolithic integration for polarization imaging and non-destructive semiconductor chip inspection, advancing room-temperature, compact, and polarization-sensitive THz technologies.</description>

      <title>Voltage-controlled beam steering in liquid-crystal-integrated dual-mode plasmonic nanolaser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic control of laser emission direction is crucial for developing compact and reconfigurable nanophotonic devices. In this work, we numerically present a plasmonic nanolaser (PNL) integrated with a voltage-controlled liquid crystal (LC) layer to achieve active beam steering. We modeled the orientation of LC molecules under an applied bias and incorporated this into electromagnetic simulations to assess the optical response. We observed lasing at an emission wavelength of 870 nm for the single-mode PNL, with discrete voltage-dependent deflections of the far-field emission of up to $\pm67$\textdegree, while maintaining a beam divergence of less than 1\textdegree. The steering characteristics were significantly influenced by the electro-optic properties of the LC layer, with an optimized thickness of 3 $\mu$m. The structural periodicity governed the achievable angular separation and emission stability. Furthermore, we extended the concept to a dual-mode nanolaser based on a merged nanohole array (NHA), which supports two lasing wavelengths at 873 nm and 880 nm. Both lasing modes exhibited simultaneous voltage-dependent angular tuning without altering the cavity geometry. These results highlight the potential of LC-integrated PNLs as voltage-controlled, reconfigurable light sources for applications in optical interconnects, beam routing, adaptive imaging, and multiplexed communication.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Photocarrier Mean Free Path via Speckled Laser Pump -- Transient Fourier Microscopy Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean free path of photocarriers is a crucial parameter for material design, device optimization, and new optoelectronics applications. Currently, this parameter remains unknown for many materials, and experimental means available for its measurement are considerably lacking. Meanwhile, it remains an unclear issue whether the mean free path of the photogenerated high-energy hot carriers is significantly different from that of the localequilibrium-state carriers near the Fermi surface or around the band edge. Based on the concept of transient grating Fourier transform and utilizing a virtual lock-in amplification technique, we proposed and demonstrated an efficient experimental technique for measuring the mean free path of photocarriers. This method has facilitated direct observation of the photocarrier transport behavior across the transition between diffusive and ballistic motion, from which we surprisingly find that the mean free path of photogenerated hot carriers in Silicon membrane and GaAs quantum well can reach micron scale, more than an order of magnitude larger compared to the electrically-measured one. This work provides new ideas for characterization of photoelectronic devices under operating status and is expected to greatly enhance the understanding of the photocarrier transport process in opto-electronic or photonic materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate programmable photonic control of radiative heat transport in nanoscale networks through phase-controlled interference between elastic and inelastic Floquet scattering channels induced by temporal permittivity modulation. Relative modulation phases select constructive or destructive interference, enabling directional thermal-photon currents and heat splitting even at thermal equilibrium. Modulation amplitude and frequency further tune the enhancement, suppression and redistribution of energy flow. This interference-based mechanism enables thermal routing and logic operations and provides a general platform for reconfigurable photonic heat management at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Sub-doppler trace-gas photoacoustic spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules are emerging as new benchmark for metrology and fundamental physics research, driving the demand for spectroscopic techniques combining high sensitivity and resolution. Photoacoustic spectroscopy has proven to combine high sensitivity with appealing features like compactness, wavelength-independent and background-free detection. To date, photoacoustic sensing has mostly been focused on high-pressure applied trace-gas analysis, while accessing the low-pressure regime has been considered not compatible with efficient acoustic wave propagation. However, sensing gas samples at low pressure is the key to get access to high-resolution spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate that sub-Doppler saturation spectroscopy can be performed on low-pressure trace gases in a cavity-enhanced photoacoustic sensor with mW-level mid-infrared radiation. Moreover, we show that the same setup can be operated at higher pressure, enabling trace-gas detection with 5 parts-per-billion sensitivity with a laser power as low as 35 microwatts. This allows to extend the unique advantages of the photoacoustic technique to metrology and fundamental physics and provides the mid-infrared with a cost-effective, flexible tool combining high sensitivity and resolution.</description>

      <title>Addressing intramolecular vibrational redistribution in a single molecule through pump and probe surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of accurate tools to characterize Intramolecular Vibrational Redistribution (IVR) is of major interest in chemistry. In this context, surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies stand up as well-established techniques to study molecular vibrational lines and populations with a sensitivity that can reach the singe-molecule level. However, to date, this possibility has not been fully developed to address IVR. Here, we establish a quantum mechanical framework based on molecular optomechanics that accounts for IVR, and adopt it to analyze strategies to optimize IVR characterization by vibrational spectroscopy. In particular, we model two different pump-and-probe configurations where the vibrational pumping is provided either by infrared laser illumination or by Stokes SERS. We show for the two pumping configurations the existence of clear signatures on the anti-Stokes SERS spectra of population transfer between coupled vibrational modes in a molecule. Our calculations adopt realistic molecular and SERS parameters, suggesting that these signatures of IVR are accessible at the single-molecule level with current experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Topological States Enabled by Non-local Nonlinearity in Synthetic Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and nonlinearity represents a central challenge in modern physics. Here, we investigate this interplay by considering a synthetic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with all-to-all nonlocal interactions. We find that the distinctive nonlinearity maintains an effective chiral symmetry and leads to a quantized nonlinear winding and Berry phase, as corroborated by the developed Bogoliubov nonlinear adiabatic theory. Increasing nonlinearity drives a sequence of topological transitions signaled by the appearance of characteristic swallowtail band structures at intermediate interaction strengths and band swapping in the strong nonlinear regime. The band swapping results in quantized fractional windings and double-period Bloch oscillations that are closely related to discrete time crystals. Remarkably, even starting from a topologically trivial linear system, nonlocal nonlinearity can induce an emergent topological phase with fractional windings. Experimentally, our model can be realized using photons in a degenerate optical cavity with Rydberg-mediated interactions. Our results establish a rigorous framework and pave the way for exploring nonlinear topological phenomena and their applications in synthetic quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms and Opportunities for Tunable High-Purity Single Photon Emitters: A Review of Hybrid Perovskites and Prospects for Bright Squeezed Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are central to quantum communication, computing, and metrology, yet their development remains constrained by trade-offs in purity, indistinguishability, and tunability. This review presents a mechanism-based classification of SPEs, offering a physics-oriented framework to clarify the performance limitations of conventional sources, including quantum emitters and nonlinear optical processes. Particular attention is given to hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (HOIP QDs), which provide size- and composition-tunable emission with narrow linewidths and room-temperature operation. Through comparative analysis of physical mechanisms and performance metrics, we show how HOIP QDs may address key limitations of established SPE platforms. Recognizing the constraints of current deterministic sources, we introduce a performance framework to guide the development of scalable SPEs, and examine the theoretical potential of bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) states, discussing how BSV mechanisms could serve as a promising avenue for multiplexable, high-purity photon generation beyond conventional heralded schemes. The review concludes by outlining future directions for integrating HOIP- and BSV-based concepts into scalable quantum photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>High-repetition-rate terahertz and ultraviolet radiation for high-throughput ultrafast electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling femtosecond terahertz (THz) and ultraviolet (UV) sources to high repetition rates is essential for high-throughput ultrafast spectroscopy and imaging applications. Yet, their efficient generation at high average power remains limited by thermal effects, phase-matching constraints, and material damage. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz and UV generation driven by a common Yb:KGW laser operating from at 40 - 600 kHz. THz radiation is produced by optical rectification in stoichiometric MgO:LiNbO$_3$ using a line-focus geometry, yielding single-cycle pulses of 55 - 92 nJ energy with peak electric fields of 37 - 90 kV/cm. Electro-optic sampling and beam-quality measurements reveal tunable control between central frequency, bandwidth and field amplitude by translating the generation region transversely within the crystal. Using shorter pump pulses preserves THz conversion efficiency, while longer pulses at 100 kHz reduce THz output by up to a factor of four due to cumulative thermal effects. Femtosecond 257.5 nm UV pulses are generated by cascaded fourth-harmonic generation in $\beta$-barium borate with conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% at 40 kHz and stable operation up to 600 kHz. These results demonstrate a compact, thermally robust platform for high-average-power nonlinear conversion and are directly relevant to next-generation high-repetition-rate ultrafast electron diffraction and spectroscopy systems.</description>

      <title>Terahertz magneto-photocurrents in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ probe its topological surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ultrafast magneto-photocurrents in a three-dimensional topological insulator. For this purpose, we excite (In$_r$Bi$_{1-r}$)$_2$Se$_3$ thin films with a femtosecond laser pulse in the presence of an external magnetic field $B_{\text{ext}}$ up to 0.3 T parallel to the film plane. The resulting in-plane photocurrent is measured by detecting the emitted terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse. It scales linearly with $B_{\text{ext}}$ and is perpendicular to $B_{\text{ext}}$. Strikingly, for $r\ge$4%, we observe an abrupt photocurrent reduction, which is strongly correlated with the Indium-induced quenching of the topological surface states. The rise time, decay time and amplitude of the THz magneto-photocurrent can consistently be explained by a scenario in which optically excited spin-polarized electrons propagate toward the film surface where the accumulated spin is converted into an in-plane charge current due to spin-velocity locking. Our results are highly relevant for contact-free probing of spin-charge conversion in systems with paramagnetic rather than spontaneous magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Driven Dissipation and Stabilization of a Levitated Rotor with Multi-Day Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of nonlinear mode-crossing dissipation and injection-locking-like stabilization in a milligram-scale diamagnetically levitated quartz cube. By optically driving the cube to rotation rate near 360 RPM, we observe that its angular velocity does not decay smoothly but instead decreases in discrete steps whenever the instantaneous rotation frequency crosses one of several higher-order mechanical modes. We observe rotational dissipation times on the order of a few days. When a weak counteracting radiation-pressure torque is applied, the system unexpectedly stabilizes at a constant rotation rate that persists for about two days, constituting the mechanical analogue of injection locking. Our results reveal a new regime of multimode nonlinear dynamics in low-dissipation levitated solids and establish diamagnetic levitation as a platform for exploring non-Hamiltonian many-mode interactions and mechanically engineered nonlinear attractors and sensors.</description>

      <title>Spheroidal core-mantle particle absorption, scattering, and polarisation in the long-wavelength limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical calculation of optical properties (extinction, absorption, scattering and polarisation efficiencies) is often time-consuming for non-spherical and inhomogeneous particles. Where possible analytical methods are therefore to be preferred. We provide an analytical tool to derive the optical properties of mantled spheroidal particles, of arbitrary axis ratio, in the long wavelength limit (a &lt;&lt; lambda), where the mantle form may be confocal, co-axial or of constant depth with respect to the particle core. We have developed an analytical approach to spheroidal core/mantle particle optical property calculations. The analytical method compares well with DDSCAT numerical calculations and, under limited circumstances, with those made using the Bruggemann effective medium theory (EMT).The analytical method presented here provides a useful tool to explore the optical and polarisation properties of core/mantle spheroidal particles at long wavelengths (lambda &gt;~ 8mu) and is simpler and faster to implement than corresponding numerical methods. We caution against the use of EMT methods in approximating the optical properties of core/mantle particles.</description>

      <title>Generation of circular polarized high-order harmonics from single color quantum light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atomic response to an ultra-intense driving field produces a characteristic high-harmonic spectrum featuring a rapid drop in intensity for the lower harmonics, followed by a plateau and a sharp cutoff. This response vanishes for circularly polarized classical drivers -- a limitation that can be overcome by introducing quantum features into the driving field. In this work, we show that squeezed highly elliptically polarized drivers not only enable the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in classically forbidden regimes of large ellipticity, but also yield highly elliptical harmonic radiation with pronounced super-Poissonian photon statistics. Moreover, we show that the HHG spectral features encode information about the quantum nature of the driving field, revealing the presence of its squeezed field fluctuations. By analyzing the HHG spectral intensity dependence as a function of the driver's ellipticity and squeezing orientation, we identify a means to probe the driving field's quantum properties that intrinsically lie in the high-photon number regime.</description>

      <title>Photon blockade effect from synergistic optical parametric amplification and driving force in Kerr-medium single-mode cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates photon blockade control in a hybrid quantum system containing a Kerr-nonlinear cavity coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay.To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect.Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction.The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interaction Between Free Electrons and Light Involving First-order and Second-order Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM) effect has revealed the quantum interaction between free electrons and optical near filed, which demonstrated plenty of novel phenomena of manipulating free electron wave packet and detecting/shaping quantum photonic states. However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory.

      <title>Geometry-induced Exceptional Point Detached from Fermi Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), ubiquitous non-Hermitian degeneracies, are central features in band structures where non-Hermitian Fermi arcs connect EPs and eigenvalue knots encircle them. Under open boundary conditions (OBCs), non-Hermitian skin effects enforce complex momenta and yield non-Bloch band structures, introducing EPs unique to OBCs whose origins depend on boundary-driven mechanisms. Here, we reveal both theoretically and experimentally that geometry itself can induce such non-Bloch EPs in a reciprocal non-Hermitian Lieb lattice supporting geometry-dependent skin effects. By analyzing non-Bloch band structures, we find that geometry-induced EPs correspond to saddle points rather than branch points. Branch points, even while carrying OBC eigenenergies, do not yield EPs but manifest as Whitney cusps, a characteristic type of geometric singularity, and Fermi arcs connecting them remain crucial in determining eigenvalue knots. Our measurements of these knots confirm that geometry-induced EPs are detached from the branch points of Fermi arcs, contrasting with their unified counterparts in Bloch systems. Our results establish geometry as an additional degree of freedom for engineering EP-based devices and reveal its fundamental role in shaping non-Bloch band structures.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Induced Transparency-Absorption and Normal-Anomalous Dispersion Characteristics of ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ Medium or Any J-Type Configuration Atomic Vapors Subject to a Vector Magnetic Field and a Weak Resonant Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an analytical framework for magnetically induced transparency-absorption (MITA) and normal-anomalous dispersion (MINAD) in a weakly driven ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapor, or any J-type three-level system, under a vector magnetic field. By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping. The results provide a theoretical basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Broadband quasistatic passive cloaking: bounds and limitations in the near-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider here several aspects of the following challenging question: is it possible to use a passive cloak to make invisible a dielectric inclusion on a finite frequency interval in the quasistatic regime of Maxwell's equations for an observer close to the object? In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The light deflection under a strong gravitational field, referred to as strong gravitational lensing, provides a powerful probe of spacetime geometry. Besides, laboratory analogue models are employed to study the effects of curved spacetime and explore the design of optical devices. Here, applying the framework of analogue gravity, we reveal the behavior of the optical echo from a pulsed point-like source near a black hole, which is strongly dependent on the interplay of the black hole's photon sphere and the source's duration. We model the Schwarzschild spacetime as a Flamm paraboloid and calculate the echo response, using analytical geodesic solutions and the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Particularly, when the spatial scale of pulse duration is comparable to the photon sphere, continuous ``echo tails" appear along bright interference fringes in temporal response. Analysis in both the temporal and frequency domains reveals that these echo tails are a signature of resonance between the incoming pulse and the photon sphere. This work provides a wave-optics perspective on the interaction between dynamic sources and black holes, offering a table top window on strong gravitational lensing.</description>

      <title>Microscopy system for in situ sea ice structure and biology observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sea ice harbours a rich community of well-adapted microorganisms that inhabit liquid micro-spaces where extreme conditions prevail. Currently at risk under climate change, the sea-ice microbiome holds mysteries about evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere, which require methodological innovation to be unravelled. Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we present an in situ microscopic imaging system to observe undisturbed living microorganisms directly within sea the ice matrix. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, including its water crystal lattice, brine channels, air bubbles, and various impurities, presents engineering challenges for the development of this imaging system. Despite the fragile nature of the sea-ice matrix, we could successfully deploy, test and use the new in situ microscope during a recent expedition on the icepack in Arctic. We collected numerous images of live and intact single-celled and colony-forming diatoms, and documented for the first time at such a high resolution some microphysical features of sea ice. The hardware and software design of the endoscope is presented along with acquisition results of the microstructure and diatom images. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential for this new in situ microscopic imaging system to transform the way we study sea ice and to allow a deeper understanding of its complex microstructure and living microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Fast control of the transverse structure of a light beam using acousto-optic modulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast, reprogrammable control over the transverse structure of light beams plays an essential role in applications such as structured illumination microscopy, optical trapping, and quantum information processing. Existing technologies, such as liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulators (LCoS-SLMs) and digital micromirror devices (DMDs), suffer from limited refresh rates, low damage thresholds, and high insertion loss. Acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) can resolve the above issues, as they typically handle higher laser power and offer lower insertion loss. By effectively mapping the temporal radio-frequency (RF) waveforms onto the spatial diffraction patterns of the optical field, individual AOMs have been shown to generate one-dimensional (1D) spatial modes at a pixel refresh rate of nearly 20 MHz. We extend this concept to enable fast modulation in a two-dimensional (2D) space using a double-AOM scheme. We demonstrate the generation of 2D Hermite-Gaussian (HG_nm) modes with an average fidelity of 81%, while the highest-order mode generated, HG_53, retains a fidelity of 56%.</description>

Abstract: We develop and demonstrate a first-principles approach, based on the nonlinear Maxwell-Bloch equations and steady-state ab-initio laser theory (SALT), for inverse design of nanostructured lasers, incorporating spatial hole-burning corrections, threshold effects, out-coupling efficiency, and gain diffusion. The resulting figure of merit exploits the high-$Q$ regime of optimized laser cavities to perturbatively simplify the nonlinear model to a single linear ''reciprocal'' Maxwell solve. The consequences for laser-cavity design, and in particular the strong dependence on the nature of the gain region, are demonstrated using topology optimization of both 2d and full 3d geometries.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Photonic Crystal Biosensors using Topological Light Trapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic crystals (PCs) with localized optical cavity modes arising from topological domain-wall line defects are simulated for optical biosensing by numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. These consist of a square lattice of square silicon blocks with a significant photonic band gap (PBG). Optical transmission through the PBG at specific frequencies occurs by defect-mediated optical tunneling. Biofluid flows perpendicular to light propagation, through a channel containing the PC, defined by silica side-walls and an underlying silica substrate. Replacing the silicon blocks with thin silicon strips throughout the domain-wall region, analyte binding coincides with regions of maximal field intensity. As a result, the sensitivity is improved by almost 16 times higher than the previous designs. We analyze optical mode hybridization of two nearby domain walls and its close relation to the transmission-levels and correlations in frequency shifts of nearby optical resonances in response to analyte-bindings. We illustrate three high-sensitivity chips each with three domain-wall defects, all of which can distinguish three analyte-bindings and their combinations completely in a single spectroscopic measurement. In a photonic crystal, consisting of silicon squares embedded in a water background and a 5-micron lattice spacing, the biosensor sensitivity to a thin analyte binding layer is nearly 3000 nm/RIU, and to the overall background biofluid is over 8000 nm/RIU.</description>

      <title>H\"ansch-Couillaud locking of a large Sagnac interferometer: advancing below the flicker floor</title>

Abstract: Large Sagnac interferometers in the form of active ring lasers have emerged as unique rotation sensors in the geosciences, where their sensitivity allows to detect geodetic and seismological signals. The passive laser gyroscope variant, however, is still at a stage of development, and thus far, only the Pound-Drever-Hall frequency stabilization technique has been explored, a method limited by residual amplitude modulation. Here, as an alternative method, we present the first H\"ansch-Couillaud locked passive laser gyroscope. We find that this method is limited by flicker noise, and we introduce a cost-effective lock-in scheme to overcome this limitation. We achieve a sensitivity of 3.1 nrad/s, corresponding to a fraction of $7.7\cdot 10^{-5}$ in the Earth's rotation rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) microscope (OCM) uses a high-numerical-aperture objective to achieve cellular-level lateral resolution. However, its practical imaging depth range is limited by the depth of focus (DOF). Although computational refocusing can potentially provide sharp images outside the DOF, signal reduction by the confocal effect still limits the imaging depth in practice in point-scanning OCT. In addition, standard OCT cannot visualize intra-tissue activities. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrated a spatially coherent full-field OCM (SC-FFOCM) with computational refocusing. In addition, a repetitive acquisition protocol was designed to visualize intra-tissue activities (i.e., dynamic OCT imaging). The in-focus lateral resolution is 1.4 um, and the axial resolution is 6.5 um (in air) at full-width at half-maximum intensity. Three-dimensional structure and the dynamic OCT imaging using SC-FFOCM with computational refocusing was applied to human breast adenocarcinoma spheroids (MCF-7 cell line). Volumetric dynamic imaging with cellular-level lateral resolution was demonstrated over the full depth of the spheroid.</description>

Abstract: Hyperbolic Metamaterials (HMMs) continue to be intriguing due to their applications in super resolution imaging and spontaneous emission control. One of the successful realizations of HMMs is a layered metal-dielectric film. Despite the extensive knowledge in thin film technology and the promises of HMM's applications, the scale up and practical utilization of HMMs have not yet occurred. A general design approach is needed to predict the transition of a layered structure into an HMM. In this work, effective medium approximation and transfer matrix method are combined to determine the transition and validated by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on a predefined HMM structure made of silver and alumina. Four interdependent design parameters are explored: thicknesses of metal and dielectric layers, transition wavelength, and minimum number of periods required for a layered metal-dielectric film to display hyperbolic dispersion. The findings are presented as a practical engineering design chart, similar to a state diagram, that can be extended to other combinations of materials.</description>

Abstract: Indium-tin oxide (ITO) is a crucial functional layer for the optoelectronic applications, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, thermally induced crystallization may alter the optical properties of ITO layers as well. But the potential change in color of the ITO layers is not considered so far. In this work, we investigate the structural and optical properties of ITO thin film films via X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. After thermal annealing at 250 {\deg}C, the ITO thin films of 15-100 nm get crystallized with strong changes in refractive index n and extinction coefficient k in the visible light range. However, for the 5-nm ITO thin film, crystallization is only observed after thermal annealing at 350 {\deg}C and the change in color is limited upon phase transition. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 {\deg}C) and ITO film thickness (5-100 nm). Our work suggests that the intrinsic change in colors of ITO layers should also be considered for the PCM-based reconfigurable display application.</description>

      <title>Sculpting ultrafast mid-infrared light for solid-state high harmonic generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to sculpt light in space, time, and polarization has revolutionized studies of light-matter interaction and enabled breakthroughs in optical communication, imaging, and ultrafast science. Among the many degrees of freedom of light, orbital angular momentum (OAM) further expands these capabilities by unlocking new regimes of control in information encoding, particle trapping and manipulation, and symmetry-driven selection rules. However, exploiting OAM to drive nonlinear, non-perturbative effects in solids remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral regime-a key region for accessing these effects in ambient air, where spatial light modulators do not operate. Here, we circumvent this limitation by generating femtosecond, few-cycle MIR Bessel-Gauss vortex (BGV) and perfect optical vortices (POVs), using a robust, static spatial-shaping strategy. By utilizing these beams to drive nonlinear optical processes such as second-harmonic generation (SHG) and high-harmonic generation (HHG) in various solid-state materials, we show that the resulting harmonic beams faithfully inherit the structural characteristics of the drivers: the constant-intensity ring of the POVs is preserved across harmonic orders, while the BGV harmonic beams retain their intrinsic topological charge-dependent intensity profiles. Furthermore, by verifying the linear OAM up-scaling law, we confirm the conservation of OAM during SHG and HHG in solids. These results establish strong-field HHG in solids as a robust platform for synthesizing ultrafast structured harmonic light with controllable, high-value OAM.</description>

Abstract: Cavity dressing of molecular vibrational dynamics expands the role of characteristic vibrations as spectroscopic markers of underlying ultrafast dynamics. Interacting vibrational modes exhibit a pronounced excited state delocalization due to the interaction with the cavity mode, which is reflected in the ultrafast dynamics. We characterize the ultrafast dynamics of these cavity-dressed characteristic vibrations in the presence of dissipation. Specifically, we present two complementary three-pulse coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques capable of monitoring one- and two-quantum cavity-dressed vibrational excitations. Dissipative properties, such as transport and dephasing, are described using a microscopic theory that includes low- and high-energy phonon modes. Simulations were performed with finite laser pulses. The cavity coupling strengths fall within a range similar to vibrational mode couplings, hinting towards a possibility of control of intermolecular vibrational energy redistribution. The framework is extendable to a broad range of cavity-controlled nonlinear spectroscopies of dissipative molecular systems.</description>

      <title>SinBasis Networks: Matrix-Equivalent Feature Extraction for Wave-Like Optical Spectrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave-like images--from attosecond streaking spectrograms to optical spectra, audio mel-spectrograms and periodic video frames--encode critical harmonic structures that elude conventional feature extractors. We propose a unified, matrix-equivalent framework that reinterprets convolution and attention as linear transforms on flattened inputs, revealing filter weights as basis vectors spanning latent feature subspaces. To infuse spectral priors we apply elementwise \(\sin(\cdot)\) mappings to each weight matrix. Embedding these transforms into CNN, ViT and Capsule architectures yields Sin-Basis Networks with heightened sensitivity to periodic motifs and built-in invariance to spatial shifts. Experiments on a diverse collection of wave-like image datasets--including 80,000 synthetic attosecond streaking spectrograms, thousands of Raman, photoluminescence and FTIR spectra, mel-spectrograms from AudioSet and cycle-pattern frames from Kinetics--demonstrate substantial gains in reconstruction accuracy, translational robustness and zero-shot cross-domain transfer. Theoretical analysis via matrix isomorphism and Mercer-kernel truncation quantifies how sinusoidal reparametrization enriches expressivity while preserving stability in data-scarce regimes. Sin-Basis Networks thus offer a lightweight, physics-informed approach to deep learning across all wave-form imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference in Two-Atom Resonant X-ray Scattering of an Intense Attosecond Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.</description>

      <title>Optimized Single-Core PCF-Based SPR Biosensor for High-Performance Early-Stage Multi-Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a highly sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based biosensor integrated with a circular-lattice Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) for early-stage cancer detection. The proposed sensor leverages the synergy between SPR and PCF technologies to overcome the bulkiness and limited sensitivity of traditional SPR systems. A thin gold (Au) layer, responsible for plasmon excitation, is deposited on the fiber structure, while a nanolayer of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is introduced to enhance adhesion between the gold and the silica background, improving structural stability and field confinement. The sensor is designed to detect refractive index (RI) variations in biological analytes, specifically targeting cancerous cells from skin, blood, and adrenal gland tissues. The optical characteristics and performance of the sensor were thoroughly analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, allowing for precise simulation and optimization. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity within the RI range of 1.360-1.395, corresponding to the RI values of the target cancer cells. Remarkable wavelength sensitivities of 21,250 nm/RIU, 53,571 nm/RIU, and 103,571 nm/RIU were achieved for skin, blood, and adrenal gland cancers, respectively. In addition, a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 306.424 RIU^-1 and a spectral resolution (SR) of 9.57x10^-7 RIU further affirm the sensor's exceptional detection capabilities. These findings indicate the proposed SPR-PCF sensor's strong potential for real-time, label-free biosensing applications, particularly in precise and early cancer diagnostics.</description>
