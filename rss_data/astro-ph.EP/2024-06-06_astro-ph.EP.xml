      <title>The near-infrared degree of polarization in debris disks. Toward a self-consistent approach to model scattered light observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris disks give us the unique opportunity to probe the properties of small $\mu$m-sized particles, allowing us to peer into the constituents of their parent bodies, young analogs of comets and asteroids of our solar system. In the past, studies of the total intensity phase function have proven powerful to constrain the main characteristics of the dust particles in debris disks. Nonetheless, there can remain some degeneracies in the modeling that can be alleviated when considering polarized intensity observations. We obtained new near-IR scattered light observations of four young debris disks which allow us to constrain the degree of linear polarization as a function of the scattering angle. All four debris disks are detected in polarized intensity, and three are also recovered in total intensity. We measured peak degree of polarization of $\lesssim 40$\% for all three disks. We find that the particles must consist of highly refractive and absorbing material. For HD129590, by measuring the polarization fraction beyond the birth ring, we constrain the width of the size distribution to be smaller and smaller, compatible with the effect of radiation pressure. We put these findings to the test and present a self-consistent approach to produce synthetic images, assuming different profiles for the radiation pressure strength, and accounting for the presence of unbound grains. We find the contribution of these grains to be especially critical to reproduce the increasing degree of polarization with stellocentric distances. Some of our results might seem difficult to reconcile with our understanding of cosmic dust but since similar results have been obtained for other disks, we discuss the current limitation of available light scattering models as well as possible avenues to alleviate these unfortunate limitations.</description>

      <title>Detection of Close Kuiper Belt Binaries with HST WFC3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries in the Kuiper Belt are common. Here we present our analysis of the Solar System Origins Legacy Survey (SSOLS) to show that using a PSF-fitting method can roughly double the number of binaries identified in that dataset. Out of 198 Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) observed by SSOLS, we find 23 to be visually separated binaries, while a further 19 are blended-PSF binaries detectable with the method we present here. This is an overall binary fraction of 21% for the SSOLS dataset of cold classical KBOs. In addition, we tested our fitting methods on synthetic data, and while we were able to show it to be very effective at detecting certain blended-PSF binary KBOs, fainter or closer binary KBOs may easily be missed, suggesting that the close binary KBO fraction could be even higher. These results strongly support the idea that most (if not all) KBOs were formed through the Streaming Instability process, and as a consequence, most KBOs were formed as near-equal mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Investigation of boulder distribution in (1) Ceres and insight into its surface evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface conditions of terrestrial bodies strongly reflect their geological evolutionary processes and vary among various terrestrial bodies. This diversity is attributed to variations in the timescales of boulder formation through processes such as impact cratering, rockfalls from crater walls, seismic motion, and boulder fragmentation caused by micrometeoroid impacts and thermal stress. In this study, we examined boulders on Ceres using high-resolution images with a resolution of approximately 5 m/px obtained during the Ceres Extended Mission 2 Orbit 7 of the Dawn mission. Almost all boulders were present around impact craters, even at a resolution of 5 m/px, thus indicating that the boulders on Ceres were created by impact cratering alone. The maximum boulder size on Ceres is approximately 200 m, even around large craters, which may indicate the upper size limit determined by the mechanical strength of the boulders, such as the tensile strength, the scale effect, and/or shattering strength. The slope of the size-frequency distribution of boulders on Ceres varied significantly across the range of boulder sizes, thus making it difficult to describe it using a single function of a power-law relationship; in particular, it changed at approximately 100 m, thus indicating that destructive or formation mechanisms may be different for large boulders &gt; 100 m and for small boulders &lt; 100 m. There may also be a subsurface structure that prevents the formation of small boulders, although this is difficult to argue conclusively. We estimated that the lifetime of boulders larger than 50 m was equivalent to or shorter than 100 Myr. This lifetime is consistent with a theoretical estimation assuming that micrometeoroid impacts are the primary destructive mechanism.</description>

      <title>Novel Atmospheric Dynamics Shape Inner Edge of Habitable Zone Around White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to search nearby stellar systems for signs of life, but the habitable zone around these stars is still poorly understood. Since white dwarfs are compact stars with low luminosity, any planets in their habitable zone should be tidally locked, like planets around M-dwarfs. Unlike planets around M-dwarfs, however, habitable white dwarf planets have to rotate very rapidly, with orbital periods ranging from hours to several days. Here we use the ExoCAM Global Climate Model (GCM) to investigate the inner edge of the habitable zone (HZ) around white dwarfs. Our simulations show habitable planets with ultrashort orbital periods ($P\lesssim$1 day) enter a ``bat rotation" regime, which differs from typical atmospheric circulation regimes around M dwarfs. Bat rotators feature mean equatorial subrotation and a displacement of the surface's hottest regions from the equator towards the midlatitudes. We qualitatively explain the onset of bat rotation using shallow water theory. The resulting circulation shifts increase dayside cloud cover and decrease stratospheric water vapor, expanding the white dwarf habitable zone by $\sim$50\% compared to estimates based on 1D models. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) should be able to quickly characterize bat rotators around nearby white dwarfs thanks to their distinct thermal phase curves. Our work underlines that tidally locked planets on ultrashort orbits may exhibit unique atmospheric dynamics, and guides future habitability studies of white dwarf systems.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous retrieval of orbital phase resolved JWST/MIRI emission spectra of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b: evidence of water, ammonia and carbon monoxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic phase curves of hot Jupiters measure their emission spectra at multiple orbital phases, thus enabling detailed characterisation of their atmospheres. Precise constraints on the atmospheric composition of these exoplanets offer insights into their formation and evolution. We analyse four phase-resolved emission spectra of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, generated from a phase curve observed with the MIRI/LRS onboard the JWST, to retrieve its atmospheric properties. Using a parametric 2D temperature model and assuming a chemically homogeneous atmosphere within the observed pressure region, we simultaneously fit the four spectra to constrain the abundances of atmospheric constituents, thereby yielding more precise constraints than previous work that analysed each spectrum independently. Our analysis reveals statistically significant evidence of NH3 (4$\sigma$) in a hot Jupiter's emission spectra for the first time, along with evidence of H2O (6.5$\sigma$), CO (3.1$\sigma$), and a non-detection of CH4. With our abundance constraints, we tentatively estimate the metallicity of WASP-43b at 0.6-6.5$\times$solar and its C/O ratio at 0.6-0.9. Our findings offer vital insights into the atmospheric conditions and formation history of WASP-43b by simultaneously constraining the abundances of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen-bearing species.</description>

      <title>Warped Disk Evolution in Grid-Based Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations show evidence that a significant fraction of protoplanetary disks contain warps. A warp in a disk evolves in time affecting the appearance of shadows and greatly influencing kinematic signatures. So far, many theoretical studies of warped disks have been conducted using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods. In our approach, we use a grid-based method in spherical coordinates which has notable advantages: the method allows for accurate modelling of low viscosity values and the resolution does not depend on density or mass of the disk, which allows surface structures to be resolved. We perform 3D simulations using FARGO3D to simulate the evolution of a warped disk and compare the results to one-dimensional models using a ring code. Additionally, we extensively investigate the applicability of grid-based methods to misaligned disks and test their dependency on grid resolution as well as disk viscosity. We find that grid-based simulations are capable of simulating disks not aligned to the grid geometry. Our three-dimensional simulation of a warped disk compares well to one-dimensional models in evolution of inclination. However, we find a twist which is not captured in 1D models. After thorough analysis we suspect this to be a physical effect possibly caused by non-linear effects neglected in the one-dimensional equations. Evaluating the internal dynamics, we find sloshing and breathing motions as predicted in local shearing box analysis. They can become supersonic, which may have consequences on kinematic observations of warped disks. Warped disks can be accurately modelled in 3D grid-based simulations when using reasonably good resolution, especially in the $\theta$-direction. We find good agreement with the linear approximation of the sloshing motion which highlights the reliability of 1D models.</description>

      <title>Carbon Isotope Fractionation of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($&gt;$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.</description>

      <title>Whistler waves in the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Earth's magnetosheath (MSH), several processes contribute to energy dissipation and plasma heating, one of which is wave-particle interactions between whistler waves and electrons. However, the overall impact of whistlers on electron dynamics in the MSH remains to be quantified. We analyze 18 hours of burst-mode measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, including data from the unbiased magnetosheath campaign during February-March 2023. We present a statistical study of 34,409 whistler waves found using automatic detection. We compare wave occurrence in the different MSH geometries and find three times higher occurrence in the quasi-perpendicular MSH compared to the quasi-parallel case. We also study the wave properties and find that the waves propagate quasi-parallel to the background magnetic field, have a median frequency of 0.2 times the electron cyclotron frequency, median amplitude of 0.03-0.06 nT (30-60 pT), and median duration of a few tens of wave periods. The whistler waves are preferentially observed in local magnetic dips and density peaks and are not associated with an increased temperature anisotropy. Also, almost no whistlers are observed in regions with parallel electron plasma beta lower than 0.1. Importantly, when estimating pitch-angle diffusion times we find that the whistler waves cause significant pitch-angle scattering of electrons in the MSH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets orbiting binary systems are relatively unexplored compared to those around single stars. Detections of circumbinary planets and planetary systems offer a first detailed view into our understanding of circumbinary planet formation and dynamical evolution. The BEBOP (Binaries Escorted by Orbiting Planets) radial velocity survey plays a special role in this adventure as it focuses on eclipsing single-lined binaries with an FGK dwarf primary and M dwarf secondary allowing for the highest-radial velocity precision using the HARPS and SOPHIE spectrographs. We obtained 4512 high-resolution spectra for the 179 targets in the BEBOP survey which we used to derive the stellar atmospheric parameters using both equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. We furthermore derive stellar masses, radii, and ages for all targets. With this work, we present the first homogeneous catalogue of precise stellar parameters for these eclipsing single-lined binaries.</description>

      <title>Planet Formation by Gas-Assisted Accretion of Small Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the accretion efficiency of small solids, with radii 1 cm $\le$ Rs $\le$ 10 m, on planets embedded in gaseous disks. Planets have masses 3 $\le$ Mp $\le$ 20 Earth masses (Me) and orbit within 10 AU of a solar-mass star. Disk thermodynamics is modeled via three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic calculations that typically resolve the planetary envelopes. Both icy and rocky solids are considered, explicitly modeling their thermodynamic evolution. The maximum efficiencies of 1 $\le$ Rs $\le$ 100 cm particles are generally $\lesssim$ 10%, whereas 10 m solids tend to accrete efficiently or be segregated beyond the planet's orbit. A simplified approach is applied to compute the accretion efficiency of small cores, with masses Mp $\le$ 1 Me and without envelopes, for which efficiencies are approximately proportional to Mp^(2/3). The mass flux of solids, estimated from unperturbed drag-induced drift velocities, provides typical accretion rates dMp/dt $\lesssim$ 1e-5 Mearth/yr. In representative disk models with an initial gas-to-dust mass ratio of 70-100 and total mass of 0.05-0.06 Msun, solids' accretion falls below 1e-6 Mearth/yr after 1-1.5 million years (Myr). The derived accretion rates, as functions of time and planet mass, are applied to formation calculations that compute dust opacity self-consistently with the delivery of solids to the envelope. Assuming dust-to-solid coagulation times of approximately 0.3 Myr and disk lifetimes of approximately 3.5 Myr, heavy-element inventories in the range 3-7 Me require that approximately 90-150 Me of solids cross the planet's orbit. The formation calculations encompass a variety of outcomes, from planets a few times the Earth mass, predominantly composed of heavy elements, to giant planets. The peak luminosities during the epoch of solids' accretion range from $\approx$ 1e-7 to $\approx$ 1e-6 times the solar luminosity.</description>

      <title>The six-planet resonant chain of HD 110067</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HD 110067 is the brightest star known to have six transiting planets. Each adjacent pair of planets has a period ratio that is nearly equal to a ratio of small integers, suggesting the planets are in a chain of mean-motion resonances, but the limited time span of the available data has prevented firm conclusions. Here, we show that the requirement of long-term dynamical stability implies that all six planets are very likely to form a resonant chain. Dynamical simulations of nonresonant systems with initial conditions compatible with the available data almost always suffer an instability within $25$ Myr ($\sim 0.3 \%$ of the system's age). Assuming the system is in resonance, we place upper limits on the planets' eccentricities and lower limits on the masses of the planets that have not yet been measured. We also predict the characteristics of transit timing variations and the values of the three-body libration centers.</description>

      <title>The Gaia white dwarf revolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review highlights the role of the Gaia space mission in transforming white dwarf research. These stellar remnants constitute 5-7% of the local stellar population in volume, yet before Gaia the lack of trigonometric parallaxes hindered their identification. The mission's Data Release 2 in 2018 provided the first unbiased colour-absolute magnitude diagram of the local stellar population, identifying 260,000 white dwarfs, with the number later increasing to over 355,000 in Data Release 3. Since then, more than 400 white dwarf studies have made critical use of Gaia data, establishing it as a fundamental resource for white dwarf identification, fundamental parameter determination and more recently spectral type characterisation. The review underscores the routine reliance on Gaia parallaxes and extensive use of its photometry in white dwarf surveys. We also discuss recent discoveries firmly grounded in Gaia data, including white dwarf mergers, exotic compact binaries and evolved planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Inter-planetary type-IV solar radio bursts: A comprehensive catalog and statistical results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decameter hectometric (DH; 1-14 MHz) type-IV radio bursts are produced by flare-accelerated electrons trapped in post-flare loops or the moving magnetic structures associated with the CMEs. From a space weather perspective, it is important to systematically compile these bursts, explore their spectro-temporal characteristics, and study the associated CMEs. We present a comprehensive catalog of DH type-IV bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) instruments onboard Wind and STEREO spacecraft, covering the period of white-light CME observations by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO mission between November 1996 and May 2023. The catalog has 139 bursts, of which 73% are associated with a fast (&gt;900 km/s) and wide (&gt;60$^o$) CME, with a mean CME speed of 1301 km/s. All DH type-IV bursts are white-light CME-associated, with 78% of the events associated with halo CMEs. The CME source latitudes are within $\pm$45$^o$. 77 events had multi-vantage point observations from different spacecraft, letting us explore the impact of line of sight on the dynamic spectra. For 48 of the 77 events, there was good data from at least two spacecraft. We find that, unless occulted by nearby plasma structures, a type-IV burst is best viewed when observed within $\pm$60$^o$ line of sight. Also, the bursts with a duration above 120 min, have source longitudes within $\pm$60$^o$. Our inferences confirm the inherent directivity in the type-IV emission. Additionally, the catalog forms a sun-as-a-star DH type-IV burst database.</description>
