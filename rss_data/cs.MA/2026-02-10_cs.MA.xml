      <title>Lemon Agent Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advanced LLM-powered agent systems have exhibited their remarkable capabilities in tackling complex, long-horizon tasks. Nevertheless, they still suffer from inherent limitations in resource efficiency, context management, and multimodal perception. Based on these observations, Lemon Agent is introduced, a multi-agent orchestrator-worker system built on a newly proposed AgentCortex framework, which formalizes the classic Planner-Executor-Memory paradigm through an adaptive task execution mechanism. Our system integrates a hierarchical self-adaptive scheduling mechanism that operates at both the overall orchestrator layer and workers layer. This mechanism can dynamically adjust computational intensity based on task complexity. It enables orchestrator to allocate one or more workers for parallel subtask execution, while workers can further improve operational efficiency by invoking tools concurrently. By virtue of this two-tier architecture, the system achieves synergistic balance between global task coordination and local task execution, thereby optimizing resource utilization and task processing efficiency in complex scenarios. To reduce context redundancy and increase information density during parallel steps, we adopt a three-tier progressive context management strategy. To make fuller use of historical information, we propose a self-evolving memory system, which can extract multi-dimensional valid information from all historical experiences to assist in completing similar tasks. Furthermore, we provide an enhanced MCP toolset. Empirical evaluations on authoritative benchmarks demonstrate that our Lemon Agent can achieve a state-of-the-art 91.36% overall accuracy on GAIA and secures the top position on the xbench-DeepSearch leaderboard with a score of 77+.</description>

      <title>The Value of Variance: Mitigating Debate Collapse in Multi-Agent Systems via Uncertainty-Driven Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) systems improve LLM reasoning through iterative deliberation, but remain vulnerable to debate collapse, a failure type where final agent decisions are compromised on erroneous reasoning. Existing methods lack principled mechanisms to detect or prevent such failures. To address this gap, we first propose a hierarchical metric that quantifies behavioral uncertainty at three levels: intra-agent (individual reasoning uncertainty), inter-agent (interactive uncertainty), and system-level (output uncertainty). Empirical analysis across several benchmarks reveals that our proposed uncertainty quantification reliably indicates system failures, which demonstrates the validity of using them as diagnostic metrics to indicate the system failure. Subsequently, we propose a mitigation strategy by formulating an uncertainty-driven policy optimization to penalize self-contradiction, peer conflict, and low-confidence outputs in a dynamic debating environment. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed uncertainty-driven mitigation reliably calibrates the multi-agent system by consistently improving decision accuracy while reducing system disagreement.</description>

      <title>Talk, Judge, Cooperate: Gossip-Driven Indirect Reciprocity in Self-Interested LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity, which means helping those who help others, is difficult to sustain among decentralized, self-interested LLM agents without reliable reputation systems. We introduce Agentic Linguistic Gossip Network (ALIGN), an automated framework where agents strategically share open-ended gossip using hierarchical tones to evaluate trustworthiness and coordinate social norms. We demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves indirect reciprocity and resists malicious entrants by identifying and ostracizing defectors without changing intrinsic incentives. Notably, we find that stronger reasoning capabilities in LLMs lead to more incentive-aligned cooperation, whereas chat models often over-cooperate even when strategically suboptimal. These results suggest that leveraging LLM reasoning through decentralized gossip is a promising path for maintaining social welfare in agentic ecosystems. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuhui-zhu/ALIGN.</description>

      <title>Altruism and Fair Objective in Mixed-Motive Markov games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental for society's viability, as it enables the emergence of structure within heterogeneous groups that seek collective well-being. However, individuals are inclined to defect in order to benefit from the group's cooperation without contributing the associated costs, thus leading to unfair situations. In game theory, social dilemmas entail this dichotomy between individual interest and collective outcome. The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas. We then extend this framework to sequential settings by defining a Fair Markov Game and deriving novel fair Actor-Critic algorithms to learn fair policies. Finally, we evaluate our method in various social dilemma environments.</description>

      <title>EvoCorps: An Evolutionary Multi-Agent Framework for Depolarizing Online Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization in online discourse erodes social trust and accelerates misinformation, yet technical responses remain largely diagnostic and post-hoc. Current governance approaches suffer from inherent latency and static policies, struggling to counter coordinated adversarial amplification that evolves in real-time. We present EvoCorps, an evolutionary multi-agent framework for proactive depolarization. EvoCorps frames discourse governance as a dynamic social game and coordinates roles for monitoring, planning, grounded generation, and multi-identity diffusion. A retrieval-augmented collective cognition core provides factual grounding and action--outcome memory, while closed-loop evolutionary learning adapts strategies as the environment and attackers change. We implement EvoCorps on the MOSAIC social-AI simulation platform for controlled evaluation in a multi-source news stream with adversarial injection and amplification. Across emotional polarization, viewpoint extremity, and argumentative rationality, EvoCorps improves discourse outcomes over an adversarial baseline, pointing to a practical path from detection and post-hoc mitigation to in-process, closed-loop intervention. The code is available at https://github.com/ln2146/EvoCorps.</description>

      <title>ValueFlow: Measuring the Propagation of Value Perturbations in Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems increasingly consist of agents that observe and respond to one another's outputs. While value alignment is typically evaluated for isolated models, how value perturbations propagate through agent interactions remains poorly understood. We present ValueFlow, a perturbation-based evaluation framework for measuring and analyzing value drift in multi-agent systems. ValueFlow introduces a 56-value evaluation dataset derived from the Schwartz Value Survey and quantifies agents' value orientations during interaction using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. Building on this measurement layer, ValueFlow decomposes value drift into agent-level response behavior and system-level structural effects, operationalized by two metrics: beta-susceptibility, which measures an agent's sensitivity to perturbed peer signals, and system susceptibility (SS), which captures how node-level perturbations affect final system outputs. Experiments across multiple model backbones, prompt personas, value dimensions, and network structures show that susceptibility varies widely across values and is strongly shaped by structural topology.</description>

      <title>Teaching an Old Dynamics New Tricks: Regularization-free Last-iterate Convergence in Zero-sum Games via BNN Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-sum games are a fundamental setting for adversarial training and decision-making in multi-agent learning (MAL). Existing methods often ensure convergence to (approximate) Nash equilibria by introducing a form of regularization. Yet, regularization requires additional hyperparameters, which must be carefully tuned--a challenging task when the payoff structure is known, and considerably harder when the structure is unknown or subject to change. Motivated by this problem, we repurpose a classical model in evolutionary game theory, i.e., the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) dynamics, by leveraging the intrinsic convergence of this dynamics in zero-sum games without regularization, and provide last-iterate convergence guarantees in noisy normal-form games (NFGs). Importantly, to make this approach more applicable, we develop a novel framework with theoretical guarantees that integrates the BNN dynamics in extensive-form games (EFGs) through counterfactual weighting. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that instantiates our framework with neural function approximation, enabling scalable learning in both NFGs and EFGs. Empirical results show that our method quickly adapts to nonstationarities, outperforming the state-of-the-art regularization-based approach.</description>

      <title>Learning to Coordinate via Quantum Entanglement in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inability to communicate poses a major challenge to coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP).</description>

      <title>Tricritical behavior in epidemic dynamics with vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08135v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the phenomenology arising from a minimal vaccination-epidemic (MVE) dynamics using three methods: mean-field approach, Monte Carlo simulations, and finite-size scaling analysis. The mean-field formulation reveals that the MVE model exhibits either a continuous or a discontinuous active-to-absorbing phase transition, accompanied by bistability and a tricritical point. However, on square lattices, we detect no signs of bistability, and we disclose that the active-to-absorbing state transition has a scaling invariance and critical exponents compatible with the continuous transition of the directed percolation universality class. Additionally, our findings indicate that the tricritical and crossover behaviors of the MVE dynamics belong to the universality class of mean-field tricritical directed percolation.</description>

      <title>When Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Meets Wireless Communications: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of commercial wireless communication and sensing equipment combined with the advancements in intelligent autonomous systems paves the way towards robust joint communications and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the nexus of SLAM and Wireless Communications, attributing the bidirectional impact of each with a focus on visual SLAM (V-SLAM) integration. We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications. Finally, integrated solutions performing joint communications and SLAM are still in their infancy: theoretical and practical advancements are required to add higher-level localization and semantic perception capabilities to RF and multi-antenna technologies.</description>

      <title>AgentSpawn: Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration Through Dynamic Spawning for Long-Horizon Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon code generation requires sustained context and adaptive expertise across domains. Current multi-agent systems use static workflows that cannot adapt when runtime analysis reveals unanticipated complexity. We propose AgentSpawn, an architecture enabling dynamic agent collaboration through: (1) automatic memory transfer during spawning, (2) adaptive spawning policies triggered by runtime complexity metrics, and (3) coherence protocols for concurrent modifications. AgentSpawn addresses five critical gaps in existing research around memory continuity, skill inheritance, task resumption, runtime spawning, and concurrent coherence. Experimental validation demonstrates AgentSpawn achieves 34% higher completion rates than static baselines on benchmarks like SWE-bench while reducing memory overhead by 42% through selective slicing.</description>

      <title>Aegis: Towards Governance, Integrity, and Security of AI Voice Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement and adoption of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs), voice agents are now being deployed in high-stakes domains such as banking, customer service, and IT support. However, their vulnerabilities to adversarial misuse still remain unexplored. While prior work has examined aspects of trustworthiness in ALLMs, such as harmful content generation and hallucination, systematic security evaluations of voice agents are still lacking. To address this gap, we propose Aegis, a red-teaming framework for the governance, integrity, and security of voice agents. Aegis models the realistic deployment pipeline of voice agents and designs structured adversarial scenarios of critical risks, including privacy leakage, privilege escalation, resource abuse, etc. We evaluate the framework through case studies in banking call centers, IT Support, and logistics. Our evaluation shows that while access controls mitigate data-level risks, voice agents remain vulnerable to behavioral attacks that cannot be addressed through access restrictions alone, even under strict access controls. We observe systematic differences across model families, with open-weight models exhibiting higher susceptibility, underscoring the need for layered defenses that combine access control, policy enforcement, and behavioral monitoring to secure next-generation voice agents.</description>

      <title>NAAMSE: Framework for Evolutionary Security Evaluation of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed in production, yet their security evaluations remain bottlenecked by manual red-teaming or static benchmarks that fail to model adaptive, multi-turn adversaries. We propose NAAMSE, an evolutionary framework that reframes agent security evaluation as a feedback-driven optimization problem. Our system employs a single autonomous agent that orchestrates a lifecycle of genetic prompt mutation, hierarchical corpus exploration, and asymmetric behavioral scoring. By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring "benign-use correctness", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes. We show that this adaptive approach provides a more realistic and scalable assessment of agent robustness in the face of evolving threats. The code for NAAMSE is open source and available at https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/NAAMSE.</description>

      <title>Progressive Multi-Agent Reasoning for Biological Perturbation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting gene regulation responses to biological perturbations requires reasoning about underlying biological causalities. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for such tasks, they are often overwhelmed by the entangled nature of high-dimensional perturbation results. Moreover, recent works have primarily focused on genetic perturbations in single-cell experiments, leaving bulk-cell chemical perturbations, which is central to drug discovery, largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments. We further propose PBio-Agent, a multi-agent framework that integrates difficulty-aware task sequencing with iterative knowledge refinement. Our key insight is that genes affected by the same perturbation share causal structure, allowing confidently predicted genes to contextualize more challenging cases. The framework employs specialized agents enriched with biological knowledge graphs, while a synthesis agent integrates outputs and specialized judges ensure logical coherence. PBio-Agent outperforms existing baselines on both LINCSQA and PerturbQA, enabling even smaller models to predict and explain complex biological processes without additional training.</description>

      <title>DHEA-MECD: An Embodied Intelligence-Powered DRL Algorithm for AUV Tracking in Underwater Environments with High-Dimensional Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems have demonstrated significant potential in complex marine exploration. However, effective AUV-based tracking remains challenging in realistic underwater environments characterized by high-dimensional features, including coupled kinematic states, spatial constraints, time-varying environmental disturbances, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hierarchical embodied-intelligence (EI) architecture for underwater multi-target tracking with AUVs in complex underwater environments. Built upon this architecture, we introduce the Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based Multi-Expert Collaborative Decision (DHEA-MECD), a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm designed to support efficient and robust multi-target tracking. Specifically, in DHEA-MECD, a Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based information extraction framework is designed to semantically decompose raw sensory observations and explicitly model complex dependencies among heterogeneous features, including spatial configurations, kinematic states, structural constraints, and stochastic perturbations. On this basis, a motion-stage-aware multi-expert collaborative decision mechanism with Top-k expert selection strategy is introduced to support stage-adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, we propose the DHEA-MECD-based underwater multitarget tracking algorithm to enable AUV smart, stable, and anti-interference multi-target tracking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior tracking success rates, faster convergence, and improved motion optimality compared with mainstream DRL-based methods, particularly in complex and disturbance-rich marine environments.</description>

      <title>Leader-following Consensus over Jointly Connected Switching Networks is Achievable for Exponentially Unstable Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leader-following consensus problem for general linear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks has been a challenging problem and the solvability of the problem has been limited to the class of linear multi-agent systems whose system matrix is marginally stable. This condition is restrictive since it even excludes the most commonly used double-integrator system. This paper presents a breakthrough by demonstrating that leader-following exponential consensus is achievable for general linear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable. The degree of instability can be explicitly characterized by two key quantities that arise from the jointly connected condition on a switching graph. By exploiting duality, we further show that the output-based distributed observer design problem for a general leader system is solvable over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable. This is also in sharp contrast to the existing distributed observers, which rely on the assumption that the leader system is marginally stable.</description>

      <title>CyberExplorer: Benchmarking LLM Offensive Security Capabilities in a Real-World Attacking Simulation Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08023v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world offensive security operations are inherently open-ended: attackers explore unknown attack surfaces, revise hypotheses under uncertainty, and operate without guaranteed success. Existing LLM-based offensive agent evaluations rely on closed-world settings with predefined goals and binary success criteria. To address this gap, we introduce CyberExplorer, an evaluation suite with two core components: (1) an open-environment benchmark built on a virtual machine hosting 40 vulnerable web services derived from real-world CTF challenges, where agents autonomously perform reconnaissance, target selection, and exploitation without prior knowledge of vulnerability locations; and (2) a reactive multi-agent framework supporting dynamic exploration without predefined plans. CyberExplorer enables fine-grained evaluation beyond flag recovery, capturing interaction dynamics, coordination behavior, failure modes, and vulnerability discovery signals-bridging the gap between benchmarks and realistic multi-target attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Failure Analysis in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet methods for interpretable failure detection and attribution remain underdeveloped. We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains "downstream-first" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions. By moving beyond black-box detection to interpretable gradient-level forensics, this framework offers practical tools for diagnosing cascading failures in safety-critical MARL systems.</description>

      <title>Effect of Electoral Seat Bias on Political Polarization: A Computational Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the causes of political polarization points towards multiple drivers of the problem, from social and psychological to economic and technological. However, political institutions stand out, because -- while capable of exacerbating or alleviating polarization -- they can be re-engineered more readily than others. Accordingly, we analyze one class of such institutions -- electoral systems -- investigating whether the large-party seat bias found in many common systems (particularly plurality and Jefferson-D'Hondt) exacerbates polarization. Cross-national empirical data being relatively sparse and heavily confounded, we use computational methods: an agent-based Monte Carlo simulation. We model voter behavior over multiple electoral cycles, building upon the classic spatial model, but incorporating other known voter behavior patterns, such as the bandwagon effect, strategic voting, preference updating, retrospective voting, and the thermostatic effect. We confirm our hypothesis that electoral systems with a stronger large-party bias exhibit significantly higher polarization, as measured by the Mehlhaff index.</description>

      <title>SynthAgent: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Realistic Patient Simulation -- A Case Study in Obesity with Mental Health Comorbidities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating high-fidelity patients offers a powerful avenue for studying complex diseases while addressing the challenges of fragmented, biased, and privacy-restricted real-world data. In this study, we introduce SynthAgent, a novel Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework designed to model obesity patients with comorbid mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, social phobia, and binge eating disorder. SynthAgent integrates clinical and medical evidence from claims data, population surveys, and patient-centered literature to construct personalized virtual patients enriched with personality traits that influence adherence, emotion regulation, and lifestyle behaviors. Through autonomous agent interactions, the system simulates disease progression, treatment response, and life management across diverse psychosocial contexts. Evaluation of more than 100 generated patients demonstrated that GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved the highest fidelity as the core engine in the proposed MAS framework, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek-R1. SynthAgent thus provides a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for exploring patient journeys, behavioral dynamics, and decision-making processes in both medical and psychological domains.</description>

      <title>T2VTree: User-Centered Visual Analytics for Agent-Assisted Thought-to-Video Authoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have substantially expanded video generation capabilities, yet practical thought-to-video creation remains a multi-stage, multi-modal, and decision-intensive process. However, existing tools either hide intermediate decisions behind repeated reruns or expose operator-level workflows that make exploration traces difficult to manage, compare, and reuse. We present T2VTree, a user-centered visual analytics approach for agent-assisted thought-to-video authoring. T2VTree represents the authoring process as a tree visualization. Each node in the tree binds an editable specification (intent, referenced inputs, workflow choice, prompts, and parameters) with the resulting multimodal outputs, making refinement, branching, and provenance inspection directly operable. To reduce the burden of deciding what to do next, a set of collaborating agents translates step-level intent into an executable plan that remains visible and user-editable before execution. We further implement a visual analytics system that integrates branching authoring with in-place preview and stitching for convergent assembly, enabling end-to-end multi-scene creation without leaving the authoring context. We demonstrate T2VTreeVA through two multi-scene case studies and a comparative user study, showing how the T2VTree visualization and editable agent planning support reliable refinement, localized comparison, and practical reuse in real authoring workflows. T2VTree is available at: https://github.com/tezuka0210/T2VTree.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Proportionality with Additive Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model where a subset of candidates must be selected based on voter preferences, subject to general constraints that specify which subsets are feasible. This model generalizes committee elections with diversity constraints, participatory budgeting (including constraints specifying how funds must be allocated to projects from different pools), and public decision-making. Axioms of proportionality have recently been defined for this general model, but the proposed rules apply only to approval ballots, where each voter submits a subset of candidates she finds acceptable. We propose proportional rules for cardinal ballots, where each voter assigns a numerical value to each candidate corresponding to her utility if that candidate is selected. In developing these rules, we also introduce methods that produce proportional rankings, ensuring that every prefix of the ranking satisfies proportionality.</description>

      <title>A Generic Service-Oriented Function Offloading Framework for Connected Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Function offloading is a promising solution to address limitations concerning computational capacity and available energy of Connected Automated Vehicles~(CAVs) or other autonomous robots by distributing computational tasks between local and remote computing devices in form of distributed services. This paper presents a generic function offloading framework that can be used to offload an arbitrary set of computational tasks with a focus on autonomous driving. To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs. Moreover, the simulation results also show the adaptability of the framework to diverse scenarios involving simultaneous offloading requests from multiple CAVs.</description>

      <title>MAFE: Enabling Equitable Algorithm Design in Multi-Agent Multi-Stage Decision-Making Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is often studied in static or single-agent settings, yet many real-world decision-making systems involve multiple interacting entities whose multi-stage actions jointly influence long-term outcomes. Existing fairness methods applied at isolated decision points frequently fail to mitigate disparities that accumulate over time. Although recent work has modeled fairness as a sequential decision-making problem, it typically assumes centralized agents or simplified dynamics, limiting its applicability to complex social systems. We introduce MAFE, a suite of Multi-Agent Fair Environments designed to simulate realistic, modular, and dynamic systems in which fairness emerges from the interplay of multiple agents. We demonstrate MAFEs across three domains -- loan processing, healthcare, and higher education -- that support heterogeneous agents, configurable interventions, and fairness metrics. The environments are open-source and compatible with standard multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) libraries, enabling reproducible evaluation of fairness-aware policies. Through extensive experiments on cooperative use cases, we demonstrate how MAFE facilitates the design of equitable multi-agent algorithms and reveals critical trade-offs between fairness, performance, and coordination. MAFE provides a foundation for systematic progress in dynamic, multi-agent fairness research.</description>

      <title>Achieving Unanimous Consensus Through Multi-Agent Deliberation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain consensus mechanisms have relied on algorithms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to ensure network functionality and integrity. However, these approaches struggle with adaptability for decision-making where the opinions of each matter rather than reaching an agreement based on honest majority or weighted consensus. This paper introduces a novel deliberation-based consensus mechanism where Large Language Models (LLMs) act as rational agents engaging in structured discussions to reach a unanimous consensus. By leveraging graded consensus and a multi-round deliberation process, our approach ensures unanimous consensus for definitive problems and graded consensus for prioritized decision problems and policies. We provide a formalization of our system and use it to show that the properties of blockchains are maintained, while also addressing the behavior in terms of adversaries, stalled deliberations, and confidence in consensus. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate system feasibility, showcasing convergence, block properties, and accuracy, which enable deliberative decision-making on blockchain networks.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems have shown exceptional decision-making capabilities, revealing significant potential for autonomic finance. Current financial trading agents predominantly simulate anthropomorphic roles that inadvertently introduce emotional biases and rely on peripheral information, while being constrained by the necessity for continuous inference during deployment. In this paper, we pioneer the harmonization of strategic depth in agents with the mechanical rationality essential for quantitative trading. Consequently, we present TiMi (Trade in Minutes), a rationality-driven multi-agent system that architecturally decouples strategy development from minute-level deployment. TiMi leverages specialized LLM capabilities of semantic analysis, code programming, and mathematical reasoning within a comprehensive policy-optimization-deployment chain. Specifically, we propose a two-tier analytical paradigm from macro patterns to micro customization, layered programming design for trading bot implementation, and closed-loop optimization driven by mathematical reflection. Extensive evaluations across 200+ trading pairs in stock and cryptocurrency markets empirically validate the efficacy of TiMi in stable profitability, action efficiency, and risk control under volatile market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Aligning Microscopic Vehicle and Macroscopic Traffic Statistics: Reconstructing Driving Behavior from Partial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A driving algorithm that aligns with good human driving practices, or at the very least collaborates effectively with human drivers, is crucial for developing safe and efficient autonomous vehicles. In practice, two main approaches are commonly adopted: (i) supervised or imitation learning, which requires comprehensive naturalistic driving data capturing all states that influence a vehicle's decisions and corresponding actions, and (ii) reinforcement learning (RL), where the simulated driving environment either matches or is intentionally more challenging than real-world conditions. Both methods depend on high-quality observations of real-world driving behavior, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. State-of-the-art sensors on individual vehicles can gather microscopic data, but they lack context about the surrounding conditions. Conversely, roadside sensors can capture traffic flow and other macroscopic characteristics, but they cannot associate this information with individual vehicles on a microscopic level. Motivated by this complementarity, we propose a framework that reconstructs unobserved microscopic states from macroscopic observations, using microscopic data to anchor observed vehicle behaviors, and learns a shared policy whose behavior is microscopically consistent with the partially observed trajectories and actions and macroscopically aligned with target traffic statistics when deployed population-wide. Such constrained and regularized policies promote realistic flow patterns and safe coordination with human drivers at scale.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Teams Hold Experts Back</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems are increasingly deployed as autonomous collaborators, where agents interact freely rather than execute fixed, pre-specified workflows. In such settings, effective coordination cannot be fully designed in advance and must instead emerge through interaction. However, most prior work enforces coordination through fixed roles, workflows, or aggregation rules, leaving open the question of how well self-organizing teams perform when coordination is unconstrained. Drawing on organizational psychology, we study whether self-organizing LLM teams achieve strong synergy, where team performance matches or exceeds the best individual member. Across human-inspired and frontier ML benchmarks, we find that -- unlike human teams -- LLM teams consistently fail to match their expert agent's performance, even when explicitly told who the expert is, incurring performance losses of up to 37.6%. Decomposing this failure, we show that expert leveraging, rather than identification, is the primary bottleneck. Conversational analysis reveals a tendency toward integrative compromise -- averaging expert and non-expert views rather than appropriately weighting expertise -- which increases with team size and correlates negatively with performance. Interestingly, this consensus-seeking behavior improves robustness to adversarial agents, suggesting a trade-off between alignment and effective expertise utilization. Our findings reveal a significant gap in the ability of self-organizing multi-agent teams to harness the collective expertise of their members.</description>

      <title>On the Uncertainty of Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a prominent paradigm for leveraging large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks. However, the mechanisms governing the effectiveness of MAS built upon publicly available LLMs, specifically the underlying rationales for their success or failure, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we revisit MAS through the perspective of uncertainty, considering both intra- and inter-agent dynamics by investigating entropy transitions during problem-solving across various topologies and six benchmark tasks. By analyzing 245 features spanning token-, trajectory-, and round-level entropy, we counterintuitively find that a single agent outperforms MAS in approximately 43.3% of cases, and that uncertainty dynamics are largely determined during the first round of interaction. Furthermore, we provide three key observations: 1) Certainty Preference: reducing uncertainty at any stage for any agent is critical for guaranteeing correct solutions; 2) Base Uncertainty: base models with lower entropy during problem-solving directly benefit MAS performance; and 3) Task Awareness: entropy dynamics of MAS play varying roles across different tasks. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, the Entropy Judger, to select solutions from MAS's pass@k results, leading to consistent accuracy improvements across all MAS configurations and tasks.

      <title>PhysicsAgentABM: Physics-Guided Generative Agent-Based Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems enable expressive agent reasoning but are expensive to scale and poorly calibrated for timestep-aligned state-transition simulation, while classical agent-based models (ABMs) offer interpretability but struggle to integrate rich individual-level signals and non-stationary behaviors. We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.</description>

      <title>RiskAgent: Synergizing Language Models with Validated Tools for Evidence-Based Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve competitive results compared to human experts in medical examinations. However, it remains a challenge to apply LLMs to complex clinical decision-making, which requires a deep understanding of medical knowledge and differs from the standardized, exam-style scenarios commonly used in current efforts. A common approach is to fine-tune LLMs for target tasks, which, however, not only requires substantial data and computational resources but also remains prone to generating `hallucinations'. In this work, we present RiskAgent, which synergizes language models with hundreds of validated clinical decision tools supported by evidence-based medicine, to provide generalizable and faithful recommendations. Our experiments show that RiskAgent not only achieves superior performance on a broad range of clinical risk predictions across diverse scenarios and diseases, but also demonstrates robust generalization in tool learning on the external MedCalc-Bench dataset, as well as in medical reasoning and question answering on three representative benchmarks, MedQA, MedMCQA, and MMLU.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Attention-Augmented Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Task Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for multi-agent task allocation (MATA) is challenged by non-stationary interactions and high-dimensional coordination. Unconstrained reward inference in these settings often leads to high variance and poor generalization. We propose an attention-structured adversarial IRL framework that constrains reward inference via spatiotemporal representation learning. Our method employs multi-head self-attention (MHSA) for long-range temporal dependencies and graph attention networks (GAT) for agent-task relational structures. We formulate reward inference as a low-capacity, adaptive linear transformation of the environment reward, ensuring stable and interpretable guidance. This framework decouples reward inference from policy learning and optimizes the reward model adversarially. Experiments on benchmark MATA scenarios show that our approach outperforms representative MARL baselines in convergence speed, cumulative rewards, and spatial efficiency. Results demonstrate that attention-guided, capacity-constrained reward inference is a scalable and effective mechanism for stabilizing adversarial IRL in complex multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic Failures in Collective Reasoning under Distributed Information in Multi-Agent LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) are expected to enhance decision-making by pooling distributed information, yet systematically evaluating this capability has remained challenging. We introduce HiddenBench, a 65-task benchmark grounded in the Hidden Profile paradigm, which isolates collective reasoning under distributed information from individual reasoning ability. Evaluating 15 frontier LLMs, we find that multi-agent LLMs achieve only 30.1% accuracy under distributed information, compared to 80.7% accuracy for single agents given complete information. We trace this gap to a systematic failure mode: agents cannot recognize or act under latent information asymmetry-they fail to reason about what others might know but have not yet expressed, leading to premature convergence on shared evidence while critical distributed facts remain unexplored. These failures persist across prompting strategies, communication depths, and group sizes-and worsen as groups scale. While some models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Flash/Pro) outperform others, neither model scale nor individual reasoning accuracy reliably predicts collective performance. Our results identify failures in collective information exploration in decision-making as a key limitation of multi-agent LLMs, and provide a theory-grounded, reproducible framework for diagnosing collective reasoning failures.</description>

      <title>StoryBox: Collaborative Multi-Agent Simulation for Hybrid Bottom-Up Long-Form Story Generation Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene, where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment. Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression. Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency, addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.</description>

      <title>GLP: A Grassroots, Multiagent, Concurrent, Logic Programming Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots platforms are distributed systems with multiple instances that can (1) operate independently of each other and of any global resource other than the network, and (2) coalesce into ever larger instances, possibly resulting in a single global instance.
  Here, we present Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP), a multiagent concurrent logic programming language designed for the implementation of grassroots platforms. We introduce the language incrementally: We recall the standard operational semantics of logic programs; introduce the operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP as a restriction of that of LP; recall the notion of multiagent transition systems and atomic transactions; introduce the operational semantics of multiagent GLP via a multiagent transition system specified via atomic transactions; and prove multiagent GLP to be grassroots. The accompanying programming example is the grassroots social graph -- the infrastructure grassroots platform on which all others are based.
  With the mathematical foundations presented here: a workstation-based implementation of Concurrent GLP was developed by AI, based on the operational semantics of Concurrent GLP; a distributed peer-to-peer smartphone-based implementation of multiagent GLP is being developed by AI, based on the operational semantics of multiagent GLP; a moded type system for GLP was implemented by AI, to facilitate the specification of GLP programs by human and AI designers, for their programming by AI; all reported in detail in companion papers.</description>

      <title>AISAC: An Integrated multi-agent System for Transparent, Retrieval-Grounded Scientific Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is a transparent, modular multi-agent runtime developed at Argonne National Laboratory to support long-horizon, evidence-grounded scientific reasoning. Rather than proposing new agent algorithms or claiming autonomous scientific discovery, AISAC contributes a governed execution substrate that operationalizes key requirements for deploying agentic AI in scientific practice, including explicit role semantics, budgeted context management, traceable execution, and reproducible interaction with tools and knowledge. AISAC enforces four structural guarantees for scientific reasoning: (1) declarative agent registration with runtime-enforced role semantics and automatic system prompt generation; (2) budgeted orchestration via explicit per-turn context and delegation depth limits; (3) role-aligned memory access across episodic, dialogue, and evidence layers; and (4) trace-driven transparency through persistent execution records and a live event-stream interface. These guarantees are implemented through hybrid persistent memory (SQLite and dual FAISS indices), governed retrieval with agent-scoped RAG, structured tool execution with schema validation, and a configuration-driven bootstrap mechanism that enables project specific extension without modifying the shared core. AISAC is currently deployed across multiple scientific workflows at Argonne, including combustion science, materials research, and energy process safety, demonstrating its use as a reusable substrate for domain-specialized AI scientific assistants.</description>

      <title>Conversational No-code, Multi-agentic Disease Module Identification and Drug Repurposing Prediction with ChatDRex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem. Heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require the expertise of specialized users. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph (NeDRex KG). ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical knowledge base. It integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis, literature mining, and drug repurposing. These are complemented by agents that evaluate functional coherence for in silico validation. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses with natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research. ChatDRex is publicly available at apps.cosy.bio/chatdrex.</description>

      <title>GRAND: Guidance, Rebalancing, and Assignment for Networked Dispatch in Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large robot fleets are now common in warehouses and other logistics settings, where small control gains translate into large operational impacts. In this article, we address task scheduling for lifelong Multi-Agent Pickup-and-Delivery (MAPD) and propose a hybrid method that couples learning-based global guidance with lightweight optimization. A graph neural network policy trained via reinforcement learning outputs a desired distribution of free agents over an aggregated warehouse graph. This signal is converted into region-to-region rebalancing through a minimum-cost flow, and finalized by small, local assignment problems, preserving accuracy while keeping per-step latency within a 1 s compute budget. On congested warehouse benchmarks from the League of Robot Runners (LoRR) with up to 500 agents, our approach improves throughput by up to 10% over the 2024 winning scheduler while maintaining real-time execution. The results indicate that coupling graph-structured learned guidance with tractable solvers reduces congestion and yields a practical, scalable blueprint for high-throughput scheduling in large fleets.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional human-AI collaboration in brain tumour assessments improves both expert human and AI agent performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) human partnerships-evaluating how AI agents enhance expert human performance-are increasingly studied. Though rarely evaluated in healthcare, an inverse approach is possible: AI benefiting from the support of an expert human agent. Here, we investigate both human-AI clinical partnership paradigms in the magnetic resonance imaging-guided characterisation of patients with brain tumours. We reveal that human-AI partnerships improve accuracy and metacognitive ability not only for radiologists supported by AI, but also for AI agents supported by radiologists. Moreover, the greatest patient benefit was evident with an AI agent supported by a human one. Synergistic improvements in agent accuracy, metacognitive performance, and inter-rater agreement suggest that AI can create more capable, confident, and consistent clinical agents, whether human or model-based. Our work suggests that the maximal value of AI in healthcare could emerge not from replacing human intelligence, but from AI agents that routinely leverage and amplify it.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mathematical Problem Solving in LLMs through Execution-Driven Reasoning Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical problem solving is a fundamental benchmark for assessing the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence and a gateway to applications in education, science, and engineering where reliable symbolic reasoning is essential. Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus. IIPC surpasses competing approaches in the majority of reasoning benchmarks on multiple base LLMs. All code and implementations are released as open source.</description>
