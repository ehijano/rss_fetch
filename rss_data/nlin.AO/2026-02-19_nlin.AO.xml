      <title>Lyapunov Spectral Analysis of Speech Embedding Trajectories in Psychosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze speech embeddings from structured clinical interviews of psychotic patients and healthy controls by treating language production as a high-dimensional dynamical process. Lyapunov exponent (LE) spectra are computed from word-level and answer-level embeddings generated by two distinct large language models, allowing us to assess the stability of the conclusions with respect to different embedding presentations. Word-level embeddings exhibit uniformly contracting dynamics with no positive LE, while answer-level embeddings, in spite of the overall contraction, display a number of positive LEs and higher-dimensional attractors. The resulting LE spectra robustly separate psychotic from healthy speech, while differentiation within the psychotic group is not statistically significant overall, despite a tendency of the most severe cases to occupy distinct dynamical regimes. These findings indicate that nonlinear dynamical invariants of speech embeddings provide a physics-inspired probe of disordered cognition whose conclusions remain stable across embedding models.</description>

      <title>Finite-size induced random switching of chimeras in a deterministic two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for interacting populations of phase oscillators exhibits chimera states whereby one population is synchronised, and the other is desynchronised. Which of the two populations is synchronised depends on the initial conditions. We show that this deterministic model exhibits random switches of their chimera states, alternating between which of the two populations is synchronised and which is not. We show that these random switches are induced by the finite size of the network. We provide numerical evidence that the switches are governed by a Poisson process and that the time between switches grows exponentially with the system size, rendering switches unobservable for all practical purposes in sufficiently large networks. We develop a reduced stochastic model for the synchronised population, based on a central limit theorem controlling the collective effect of the desynchronised population on the synchronised one, and show that this stochastic model well reproduces the statistical behaviour of the full deterministic model. We further determine critical fluctuation sizes capable of inducing switches and provide estimates for the mean switching times from an associated Kramers problem.</description>

      <title>Threshold sensing yields optimal path formation in Physarum polycephalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model organism Physarum polycephalum is known to perform decentralised problem solving despite absence of nervous system. Experimental evidence and modelling studies have linked these abilities, and in particular maze-solving, to some sort of memory and adaptation. However, despite compelling hypotheses, it is still not clear whether the tasks are solved optimally, and which key dynamical mechanisms enable Physarum's impressive abilities. Here, we employ a circuital network model for the foraging behaviour of Physarum polycephalum to prove that threshold sensing yields the emergence of unique and optimal paths that connect food sources and solve mazes. We also prove which conditions lead to alternative paths, thus elucidating how the organism achieves flexibility and adaptation in a self-organised manner. These findings are aligned with experimental evidences and provide insight into the evolution of primitive intelligence. Our results can also inspire the development of threshold-based algorithms for computing applications.</description>
