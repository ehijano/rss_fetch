      <title>Patterns of Non-Stationary Solutions to Symmetric Systems of Second-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of non-stationary solutions to a symmetric system of second-order autonomous differential equations. Our technique is based on the equivariant degree theory and involves a novel characterization of orbit types of maximal kind in the Burnside Ring product of a finite number of basic degrees for the group $O(2) \times \Gamma \times \mathbb Z_2$.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits for square and rectangular billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical billiards is much like the real game: a point mass, representing the ball, rolls in a straight line on a (perfectly friction-less) table, striking the sides according to the law of reflection. A billiard trajectory is then completely characterised by the number of elastic collisions. The rules of mathematical billiards may be simple, but the possible behaviours of billiard trajectories are endless. In fact, several fundamental theory questions in mathematics can be recast as billiards problems. A billiard trajectory is called a periodic orbit if the number of distinct collisions in the trajectory is finite. We classify all possible periodic orbits on square and rectangular tables. We show that periodic orbits on such billiard tables cannot have an odd number of distinct collisions. We also present a connection between the number of different classes of periodic orbits and Euler's totient function, which for any integer $N$ counts how many integers smaller than $N$ share no common divisor with $N$ other than $1$. We explore how to construct periodic orbits with a prescribed (even) number of distinct collisions, and investigate properties of inadmissible (singular) trajectories, which are trajectories that eventually terminate at a vertex (a table corner).</description>

      <title>Classifying Hyperbolic Ergodic Stationary Measures on Compact Complex Surfaces with Large Automorphism Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact complex surface. Consider a finitely supported probability measure $\mu$ on $\text{Aut}(X)$ such that $\Gamma_{\mu} = \langle \text{Supp}(\mu)\rangle&lt;\text{Aut}(X)$ is non-elementary. We do not assume that $\Gamma_{\mu}$ contains any parabolic elements. In this paper, we study and classify hyperbolic, ergodic $\mu$-stationary probability measures.</description>

      <title>Kac's Lemma and countable generators for actions of countable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kac's lemma determines the expected return time to a set of positive measure under iterations of an ergodic probability preserving transformations. We introduce the notion of an \emph{allocation} for a probability preserving action of a countable group. Using this notion, we formulate and prove generalization of Kac's lemma for an action of a general countable group, and another generalization that applies to probability preserving equivalence relations. As an application, we provide a short proof for the existence of countable generating partitions for any ergodic action of a countable group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of discrete dynamical systems generated by a continuous map $f$ of a compact real interval into itself where at randomly chosen times a function different from $f$ - so called impulse function is applied. We show that both the splittting property and the average contraction property guarantee the stability of the system. We give a number of examples where the verification of these properties is simple.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis in a Generalized Kuramoto Model with a Simplified Realistic Coupling Function and Inhomogeneous Coupling Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate hysteresis in a generalized Kuramoto model with identical oscillators, focusing on coupling strength inhomogeneity, which results in oscillators being coupled to others with varying strength, and a simplified, more realistic coupling function. With the more realistic coupling function and the coupling strength inhomogeneity, each oscillator acquires an effective intrinsic frequency proportional to its individual coupling strength. This is analogous to the positive coupling strength-frequency correlation introduced explicitly or implicitly in some previous models with nonidentical oscillators that show explosive synchronization and hysteresis. Through numerical simulations and analysis using truncated Gaussian, uniform, and truncated power-law coupling strength distributions, we observe that the system can exhibit abrupt phase transitions and hysteresis. The distribution of coupling strengths significantly affects the hysteresis regions within the parameter space of the coupling function. Additionally, numerical simulations of models with weighted networks including a brain network confirm the existence of hysteresis due to the realistic coupling function and coupling strength inhomogeneity, suggesting the broad applicability of our findings to complex real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Computer Validation of Open Gaps for the Almost Mathieu Operator with Critical Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present some computer assisted methods to prove the existence of spectral gaps for the Almost Mathieu operator at critical coupling and give rigorous numerical estimates on their size. As an example we show that the first 8 gaps predicted by the Gap Labelling theorem are open when $\omega=(\sqrt{5}-1)/2$ and 12 of them are open when $\omega=e-2$. A dynamical method based on the constructive conjugation to a hyperbolic cocycle and a spectral method based on the rigorous computation of the eigenvalues of finite-dimensional matrices are presented. We also present some experiments and conjectures on gap size for the associated peridodic problems.</description>

      <title>On dynamical $C^{\star}$-set and its combinatorial consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the methods from topological dynamics, H. Furstenberg introduced the notion of a central set and proved the famous Central Sets Theorem. Later D. De, Neil Hindman, and D. Strauss [Fund. Math.199 (2008), 155-175.] established a stronger version of the Central Sets Theorem and then introduced the notion of $C$-sets satisfying the Central Sets Theorem and studied the properties of these sets. For any weak mixing system $\left(X, \mathcal{B},\mu, T\right),$ and $A_{0},A_{1}\in\mathcal{B}$, with $\mu\left(A_{0}\right)\mu\left(A_{1}\right)&gt;0$, R. Kung and X.Ye [Disc. Cont. Dyn. sys., 18 (2007) 817-827.] proved that the set $N\left(A,B\right)= \left\{n:\mu\left(A_{0}\cap T^{-n}A_{1}\right)&gt;0\right\}$ intersects all sets of positive upper Banach density. However, later N. Hindman and D. Strauss [New York J. Math. 26 (2020) 230-260.] proved that there exist $C$-sets having zero upper Banach density. Inspired by this result, in this article, we prove that $N\left(A, B \right)$ intersects with all $C$-sets. Then we introduce the notion of a dynamical $C^{\star}$-set and then we study their combinatorial properties.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms from aperiodic subshifts to subshifts with the finite extension property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a countable group $G$ and two subshifts $X$ and $Y$ over $G$, a continuous, shift-commuting map $\phi : X \to Y$ is called a homomorphism. Our main result states that if every finitely generated subgroup of $G$ has polynomial growth, $X$ is aperiodic, and $Y$ has the finite extension property (FEP), then there exists a homomorphism $\phi : X \to Y$. By combining this theorem with a previous result of Bland, we obtain that if the same conditions hold, and if additionally the topological entropy of $X$ is less than the topological entropy of $Y$ and $Y$ has no global period, then $X$ embeds into $Y$. We also establish some facts about subshifts with the FEP that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Optimizing Mycorrhizal Inoculants Using Mycoponics: A Novel Framework for Nutrient Transfer and Protein Discovery in Precision Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mycorrhizal fungi form vast subterranean networks that are critical for plant nutrient uptake, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem resilience. Despite their ecological importance, optimizing these networks for precision agriculture, forestry,and carbon sequestration remains an open challenge, particularly when it comes to understanding the complex molecular and quantum-scale processes that govern nutrient exchange. In this paper, we propose a novel experimental framework using mycoponics, a controlled, soil-less environment for the study of plant fungal symbiosis integrated with isotopic labeling and quantum dots to track real-time nutrient transfer.</description>

      <title>Tail behaviour of stationary densities for one-dimensional random diffeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of stationary densities of one-dimensional random diffeomorphisms, at the boundaries of their support, which correspond to deterministic fixed points of extremal diffeomorphisms. In particular, we show how this stationary density at a boundary depends on the underlying noise distribution, as well as the linearisation of the extremal diffeomorphism at the boundary point (in case the corresponding fixed point is hyperbolic), or the leading nonlinear term of the extremal diffeomorphism (in case the corresponding fixed point is not hyperbolic).</description>

      <title>Diophantine approximation and the Mass Transference Principle: incorporating the unbounded setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the Mass Transference Principle for rectangles of Wang \&amp; Wu (Math. Ann. 2021) to incorporate the `unbounded' setup; that is, when along some direction the lower order (at infinity) of the side lengths of the rectangles under consideration is infinity. As applications, we obtain the Hausdorff dimension of naturally occurring $\limsup$ sets within the classical framework of simultaneous Diophantine approximation and the dynamical framework of shrinking target problems. For instance, concerning the former, for $\tau &gt;0$, let $S(\tau)$ denote the set of $(x_1,x_2)\in \mathbb{R}^2$ simultaneously satisfying the inequalities $\|q x_1 \| \, &lt; \, q^{-\tau} $ and $ \|q x_2 \| \, &lt; \, e^{-q}$ for infinitely many $q \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, the `unbounded' Mass Transference Principle enables us to show that
  $\dim_{\rm H} S(\tau) \, = \, \min \big\{ 1, 3/(1+\tau) \big\} \, $.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Dispersal of Ecological Species via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding species dynamics in heterogeneous environments is essential for ecosystem studies. Traditional models assumed homogeneous habitats, but recent approaches include spatial and temporal variability, highlighting species migration. We adopt starvation-driven diffusion (SDD) models as nonlinear diffusion to describe species dispersal based on local resource conditions, showing advantages for species survival. However, accurate prediction remains challenging due to model simplifications. This study uses multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with deep Q-networks (DQN) to simulate single species and predator-prey interactions, incorporating SDD-type rewards. Our simulations reveal evolutionary dispersal strategies, providing insights into species dispersal mechanisms and validating traditional mathematical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13209v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of continuous zooming systems $f:M \to M$ on a compact metric space $M$, which include the non-uniformly expanding ones, possibly with the presence of a critical set, with the zooming set dense on $M$, we prove that any H\"older potential $\phi : M \to \mathbb{R}$ for which the integrals $\int \phi d\mu \geq 0$ with respect to any $f$-invariant probability $\mu$, admits a continuous function $\lambda_{0} : M \to \mathbb{R}$ (which can be H\"older if some integral is positive) such that
  \[
  \phi \geq \lambda_{0}- \lambda_{0} \circ f.
  \]
  This extends a result in [9] for $C^{1}$-expanding maps on the circle $\mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ to important classes of maps as uniformly expanding, local diffeomorphisms with non-uniform expansion, Viana maps, Benedicks-Carleson maps and Rovella maps. We also give an example beyond the exponential contractions context.</description>

      <title>On the dimension theory of random walks and group actions by circle diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new results on the dimensional properties of measures and invariant sets associated to random walks and group actions by circle diffeomorphisms. This leads to several dynamical applications. Among the applications, we show, strengthening of a recent result of Deroin-Kleptsyn-Navas [24], that the minimal set of a finitely generated group of real-analytic circle diffeomorphisms, if exceptional, must have Hausdorff dimension less than one. Moreover, if the minimal set contains a fixed point of multiplicity k + 1 of an diffeomorphism of the group, then its Hausdorff dimension must be greater than k/(k + 1). These results generalize classical results about Fuchsian group actions on the circle to non-linear settings.
  This work is built on three novel components, each of which holds its own interest: a structure theorem for smooth random walks on the circle, several dimensional properties of smooth random walks on the circle and a dynamical generalization of the critical exponent of Fuchsian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a connection between two variants of van der Corput's Difference Theorem (vdCDT) for countably infinite amenable groups $G$ and the ergodic hierarchy of mixing properties of a unitary representation $U$ of $G$. In particular, we show that one variant of vdCDT corresponds to subrepresentations of the left regular representation, and another variant of vdCDT corresponds to the absence of finite dimensional subrepresentations. We then obtain applications for measure preserving actions of countably infinite abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Non-Archimedean techniques and dynamical degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop non-Archimedean techniques to analyze the degeneration of a sequence of rational maps of the complex projective line. We provide an alternative to Luo's method which was based on ultra-limits of the hyperbolic 3-space. We build hybrid spaces using Berkovich theory which enable us to prove the convergence of equilibrium measures, and to determine the asymptotics of Lyapunov exponents.</description>

      <title>The differential of self-consistent transfer operators and the local convergence to equilibrium of mean field strongly coupled dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the differential of a self-consistent transfer operator at a fixed point of the operator itself and show that its spectral properties can be used to establish a kind of local exponential convergence to equilibrium: probability measures near the fixed point converge exponentially fast to the fixed point by the iteration of the transfer operator. This holds also in the strong coupling case. We also show that for mean field coupled systems satisfying uniformly a Lasota-Yorke inequality the differential does also. We present examples of application of the general results to self-consistent transfer operators based on deterministic expanding maps considered with different couplings, outside the weak coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Prox-regular sweeping processes with bounded retraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. On one hand we prove that the Moreau's sweeping process driven by a uniformly prox-regular moving set with local bounded retraction has a unique solution provided that the coefficient of prox-regularity is larger than the size of any jump of the driving set. On the other hand we show how the case of local bounded retraction can be easily reduced to the $1$-Lipschitz continuous case: indeed we first solve the Lipschitz continuous case by means of the so called ``catching-up algorithm", and we reduce the local bounded retraction case to the Lipschitz one by using a reparametrization technique for functions with values in the family of prox-regular sets.</description>

      <title>Equivariant optimisation for the gravitational $n$-body problem: a computational factory of symmetric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present \texttt{SymOrb.jl}, a software which combines group representation theory and variational methods to provide numerical solutions of singular dynamical systems of paramount relevance in Celestial Mechanics and other interacting particles models. Among all, it prepares for large-scale search of symmetric periodic orbits for the classical $n$-body problem and their classification, paving the way towards a computational validation of Poincar\'e conjecture about the density of periodic orbits. Through the accessible language of Julia, \texttt{SymOrb.jl} offers a unified implementation of an earlier version. This paper provides theoretical and practical guidelines for the specific approach we adopt, complemented with examples.</description>

      <title>Gradual convergence for Langevin dynamics on a degenerate potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an ordinary differential equation with a degenerate global attractor at the origin, to which we add a white noise with a small parameter that regulates its intensity. Under general conditions, for any fixed intensity, as time tends to infinity, the solution of this stochastic dynamics converges exponentially fast in total variation distance to a unique equilibrium distribution. We suitably accelerate the random dynamics and show that the preceding convergence is gradual, that is, the function that associates to each fixed $t\geq 0$ the total variation distance between the accelerated random dynamics at time $t$ and its equilibrium distribution converges, as the noise intensity tends to zero, to a decreasing function with values in $(0,1)$. Moreover, we prove that this limit function for each fixed $t \geq 0$ corresponds to the total variation distance between the marginal, at time $t$, of a stochastic differential equation that comes down from infinity and its corresponding equilibrium distribution. This completes the classification of all possible behaviors of the total variation distance between the time marginal of the aforementioned stochastic dynamics and its invariant measure for one dimensional well-behaved convex potentials. In addition, there is no cut-off phenomenon for this one-parameter family of random processes and asymptotics of the mixing times are derived.</description>

      <title>On the amenable subalgebras of group von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We approach the study of sub-von Neumann algebras of the group von Neumann algebra $L\Gamma$ for countable groups $\Gamma$ from a dynamical perspective. It is shown that $L(\Gamma)$ admits a maximal invariant amenable subalgebra. The notion of invariant probability measures (IRAs) on the space of sub-algebras is introduced, analogous to the concept of Invariant Random Subgroups. And it is shown that amenable IRAs are supported on the maximal amenable invariant sub-algebra.</description>

      <title>Completing Prelaminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by problems in the study of Anosov and pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds, we characterize when a pair $(L^+, L^-)$ of subsets of transverse laminations of the circle can be completed to a pair of transverse foliations of the plane or, separately, realized as the endpoints of such a bifoliation of the plane. (We allow also singular bifoliations with simple prongs, such as arise in pseudo-Anosov flows). This program is carried out at a level of generality applicable to bifoliations coming from pseudo-Anosov flows with and without perfect fits, as well as many other examples, and is natural with respect to group actions preserving these structures.</description>
