      <title>Skew Kn\"orrer's periodicity Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of twisted matrix algebras of $M_2(E)$ and twisted direct products of $E\times E$ for an algebra $E$. Let $A$ be a noetherian Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebra, $z\in A_2$ be a regular central element of $A$ and $B=A_P[y_1,y_2;\sigma]$ be a graded double Ore extension of $A$. We use the Clifford deformation $C_{A^!}(z)$ of Koszul dual $A^!$ to study the noncommutative quadric hypersurface $B/(z+y_1^2+y_2^2)$. We prove that the stable category of graded maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over $B/(z+y_1^2+y_2^2)$ is equivalent to certain bounded derived categories, which involve a twisted matrix algebra of $M_2(C_{A^!}(z))$ or a twisted direct product of $C_{A^!}(z)\times C_{A^!}(z)$ depending on the values of $P$. These results are presented as skew versions of Kn\"orrer's periodicity theorem. Moreover, we show $B/(z+y_1^2+y_2^2)$ may not be a noncommutative graded isolated singularity even if $A/(z)$ is.</description>

      <title>On the sumsets of exceptional units in quaternion rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate sums of exceptional units in a quaternion ring $H(R)$ over a finite commutative ring $R$. We prove that in order to find the number of representations of an element in $H(R)$ as a sum of $k$ exceptional units for some integer $k \geq 2$, we can limit ourselves to studying the quaternion rings over local rings. For a local ring $R$ of even order, we find the number of representations of an element of $H(R)$ as a sum of $k$ exceptional units for any integer $k \geq 2$. For a local ring $R$ of odd order, we find either the number or the bounds for the number of representations of an element of $H(R)$ as a sum of $2$ exceptional units.</description>

      <title>Positivity for quantum cluster algebras from orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(S,M,U)$ be a marked orbifold with or without punctures and let $\mathcal A_v$ be a quantum cluster algebra from $(S,M,U)$ with arbitrary coefficients and quantization. We provide combinatorial formulas for quantum Laurent expansion of quantum cluster variables of $\mathcal A_v$ concerning an arbitrary quantum seed. Consequently, the positivity for the quantum cluster algebra $\mathcal A_v$ is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify some results of Bagaria and Magidor \cite{MR3152715} about the relationship between large cardinals and torsion classes of abelian groups, and prove that (1) the Maximum Deconstructibility principle introduced in \cite{Cox_MaxDecon} requires large cardinals; it sits, implication-wise, between Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. (2) While deconstructibility of a class of modules always implies the precovering property by \cite{MR2822215}, the concepts are (consistently) non-equivalent, even for classes of abelian groups closed under extensions, homomorphic images, and colimits.</description>

      <title>On crossed modules of pre-Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak{g}$-module $V$, it is due to Gerstenhaber that there is an isomorphism between $H^3(\mathfrak{g}, V )$ and the group of equivalence classes of crossed modules with kernel $V$ and cokernel $\mathfrak {g}$. The goal of this article is to obtain this result for pre-Lie algebras and their modules.</description>

      <title>The parity of Lusztig's restriction functor and Green's formula for a quiver with automorphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [8], Fang-Lan-Xiao proved a formula about Lusztig's induction and restriction functors which can induce Green's formula for the path algebra of a quiver over a finite field via the trace map. In this paper, we generalize their formula to that for the mixed semisimple perverse sheaves for a quiver with an automorphism. By applying the trace map, we obtain Green's formula for any finite-dimensional hereditary algebra over a finite field.</description>

      <title>Factorization of polynomials over the symmetrized tropical semiring and Descartes' rule of sign over ordered valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetrized tropical semiring is an extension of the tropical semifield, initially introduced to solve tropical linear systems using Cramer's rule. It is equivalent to the real tropical hyperfield, which has been used in the study of tropicalizations of semialgebraic sets. Polynomials over the symmetrized tropical semiring, and their factorizations, were considered by Quadrat. Recently, Baker and Lorscheid introduced a notion of multiplicity for the roots of univariate polynomials over hyperfields. In the special case of the hyperfield of signs, they related multiplicities with Descarte's rule of sign for real polynomials. We investigate here the factorizations of univariate polynomial functions over symmetrized tropical semirings, and relate them with the multiplicities of roots over these semirings. We deduce a Descartes' rule for "signs and valuations", which applies to polynomials over a real closed field with a convex valuation and an arbitrary (divisible) value group. We show in particular that the inequality of the Descartes' rule is tight when the value group is non-trivial. This extends to arbitrary value groups a characterization of Gunn in the rank one case, answering also to the tightness question. Our results are obtained using the framework of semiring systems introduced by Rowen, together with model theory of valued fields.</description>

      <title>On the existence of free sublattices of bounded index and arithmetic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a Dedekind domain whose field of fractions $K$ is a global field. Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional separable $K$-algebra and let $\Lambda$ be an $\mathcal{O}$-order in $A$. Let $n$ be a positive integer and suppose that $X$ is a $\Lambda$-lattice such that $K \otimes_{\mathcal{O}} X$ is free of rank $n$ over $A$. Then $X$ contains a (non-unique) free $\Lambda$-sublattice of rank $n$. The main result of the present article is to show there exists such a sublattice $Y$ such that the generalised module index $[X : Y]_{\mathcal{O}}$ has explicit upper bounds with respect to division that are independent of $X$ and can be chosen to satisfy certain conditions. We give examples of applications to the approximation of normal integral bases and strong Minkowski units, and to the Galois module structure of rational points over abelian varieties.</description>

Abstract: We extend a recent result that for the (additive) semigroup of positive integers $\mathbb{N}$, there are continuum many subdirect products of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ up to isomorphism. We prove that for $U,V$ each one of $\mathbb{Z}$ (the group of integers), $\mathbb{N}_{0}$ (the monoid of non-negative integers), or $\mathbb{N}$, we prove that $U \times V$ has continuum many (semigroup) subdirect products up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Polytope realization of cluster structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the construction of polytope functions and several results about them in [LP], we take a deep look on their mutation behaviors to find a link between a face of a polytope and a sub-cluster algebra of the corresponding cluster algebra. This find provides a way to induce a mutation sequence in a sub-cluster algebra from that in the cluster algebra in totally sign-skew-symmetric case analogous to that achieved via cluster scattering diagram in skew-symmetrizable case by [GHKK] and [M].
  With this, we are able to generalize compatibility degree in [CL] and then obtain an equivalent condition of compatibility which does not rely on clusters and thus can be generalized for all polytope functions. Therefore, we could regard compatibility as an intrinsic property of variables, which explains the unistructurality of cluster algebras. According to such cluster structure of polytope functions, we construct a fan $\mathcal{C}$ containing all cones in the $g$-fan.
  On the other hand, we also find a realization of $G$-matrices and $C$-matrices in polytopes by the mutation behaviors of polytopes, which helps to generalize the dualities between $G$-matrices and $C$-matrices introduced in [NZ] and leads to another polytope explanation of cluster structures. This allows us to construct another fan $\mathcal{N}$ which also contains all cones in the $g$-fan.</description>
