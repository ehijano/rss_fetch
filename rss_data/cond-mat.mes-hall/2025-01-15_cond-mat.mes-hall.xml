      <title>Charge to spin conversion in atomically thin bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report charge to spin conversion in a hybrid heterostructure comprised of atomically thin bismuth (Bi) confined between a silicon carbide (SiC) substrate and epitaxial graphene (EG). We confirm composition, dimensionality, and a 96.5 \% intercalation coverage using X-ray photolectron spectroscopy, scanning transmission microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Electrical transport measurements show signs of weak antilocalization in the heterostructure, consistent with spin-orbit coupling in this hybrid heterostructure. Spin torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements in permalloy/EG/2D-Bi heterostructures probe charge-to-spin conversion and revealing that an in plane polarization of the spin current, perpendicular to the charge current. The ratio of the in-plane to out-of-plane torque is 3.75 times higher than in hydrogenated graphene control samples.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall effect for metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in magnetic topological insulators offers great potential to revolutionize quantum electrical metrology by establishing primary resistance standards operating at zero external magnetic field and realizing a universal "quantum electrical metrology toolbox" that can perform quantum resistance, voltage and current metrology in a single instrument. To realize such promise, significant progress is still required to address materials and metrological challenges -- among which, one main challenge is to make the bulk of the topological insulator sufficiently insulating to improve the robustness of resistance quantization. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the QAHE; discuss the aspects of topological material growth and characterization; and present a path towards an QAHE resistance standard realized in magnetically doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ systems. We also present guidelines and methodologies for QAHE resistance metrology, its main limitations and challenges as well as modern strategies to overcome them.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Induced Slow Relaxation of Phonon Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of the polarization degree of freedom in lattice dynamics in solids has been underlined recently. We theoretically discover a relaxation mechanism for both linear and circular polarizations of acoustic phonons. In the absence of scattering, the polarization exhibits oscillatory behavior. This behavior leads to a counterintuitive result: unlike linear momentum, more frequent scattering events cause slower polarization relaxation due to motional narrowing. We validate this mechanism using the quantum kinetic equation. We derive the relaxation rates of polarizations analytically for isotropic elastic bodies and numerically for a cubic crystal. Remarkably, we reveal that linear polarizations relax more slowly than circular ones. Our findings provide a pathway to extend the lifetime of phonon angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Excitonic oscillator-strength saturation dominates polariton-polariton interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities exhibit large two-body interactions that, thanks to ever refined nanotechnology techniques, are getting closer and closer to the quantum regime where single-photon nonlinearities start being relevant. To foster additional progress in this direction, in this work we experimentally investigate the microscopic mechanism driving polariton-polariton interactions. We measure the dispersion relation of the collective excitations that are thermally generated on top of a coherent fluid of interacting lower-polaritons. By comparing the measurements with the Bogoliubov theory over both the lower and upper polariton branches simultaneously, we find that polariton-polariton interactions stem dominantly from a mechanism of saturation of the exciton oscillator strength.</description>

      <title>Magnon-induced scalar spin chirality in Kagome and honeycomb ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar spin chirality (SSC), defined as a triple product of spins, is essential for describing noncoplanar spin structures and understanding chiral physics in magnetic systems. Traditionally, SSC has been discussed primarily in the context of noncoplanar ground-state spin configurations at zero temperature, as collinear spin systems are generally thought to lack SSC. Consequently, whether the SSC can emerge at finite temperatures in spin systems with collinear ground states remains an open question and has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that thermally excited magnons can induce SSC even in collinear spin systems. By considering 2D ferromagnets on Kagome and honeycomb lattices, we demonstrate that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) which break the effective time-reversal symmetry in the magnon Hamiltonian can lead to finite SSC at finite temperatures. Using a simple spin model, we show both numerically and analytically that the SSC increases with the magnitude of DMI and temperature. Furthermore, calculations based on realistic material parameters reveal that the magnon-induced SSC can achieve a magnitude comparable to those observed in non-coplanar spin configurations. These findings suggest that SSC plays a significant role even in collinear spin systems, providing new insights into the chiral physics of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of helium surface fluctuations on the Rydberg transition of trapped electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium is an extremely clean system which holds promise for a scalable qubit platform. However, the superfluid surface is not free from fluctuations which might cause the decay and dephasing of the electrons quantized states. Understanding and mitigating these fluctuations is essential for the advancement of electrons-on-helium (eHe) qubit technology. Some work has been recently done to investigate surface oscillations due to the mechanical vibration of the cryostat using a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator. In the present work, we focus on a sub-hertz frequency range and observe a strong effect of surface oscillations on the temporal dynamics of the Rydberg transition of electrons confined in a microchannel trapping device. We suggest possible origin of such oscillations and find a reasonable agreement between the corresponding estimation of the oscillation frequency and the observed result.</description>

      <title>Exploring the energy spectrum of a four-terminal Josephson junction: Towards topological Andreev band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid multiterminal Josephson junctions (JJs) are expected to harbor a novel class of Andreev bound states (ABSs), including topologically nontrivial states in four-terminal devices. In these systems, topological phases emerge when ABSs depend on at least three superconducting phase differences, resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) energy spectrum characterized by Weyl nodes at zero energy. Here, we realize a four-terminal JJ in a hybrid Al/InAs heterostructure, where ABSs form a synthetic 3D band structure. We probe the energy spectrum using tunneling spectroscopy and identify spectral features associated with the formation of a tri-Andreev molecule, a bound state whose energy depends on three superconducting phases and, therefore, is able to host topological ABSs. The experimental observations are well described by a numerical model. The calculations predict the appearance of four Weyl nodes at zero energy within a gap smaller than the experimental resolution. These topological states are theoretically predicted to remain stable within an extended region of the parameter space, well accessible by our device. These findings establish an experimental foundation to study high-dimensional synthetic band structures in multiterminal JJs, and to realize topological Andreev bands.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Spin Diffusion in GaAs Quantum Wells: The Role of Electron Density and Channel Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between spin diffusion, spin lifetime, electron density and lateral spatial confinement in two-dimensional electron gases hosted in GaAs quantum wells. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy, we analyze how Hall-bar channel width and back-gate voltage modulation influence spin dynamics. The results reveal that the spin diffusion coefficient increases with reduced channel widths, a trend further amplified at lower electron concentrations achieved via back-gate voltages, where it increases up to 150% for the narrowest channels. The developed theoretical model confirms the spatial inhomogeneities in the spin diffusion as arising from electron-density variations within the channels. The results underscore the importance of tuning electron density and spatial geometry to optimize spin transport and coherence, providing valuable design considerations for spintronic devices where efficient spin manipulation is crucial.</description>

      <title>Origin of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ultra-thin metal films studied by in-situ neutron reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) plays an important role in different spintronic devices. The rapid development of spintronics requires a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms of the PMA formation. In our article, we demonstrate the potential of studying PMA by in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry combined with pulsed laser deposition. Using these techniques, we show the formation of out-of-plane anisotropy in thin CoFeB films (1.8 nm) with a capping Mo layer. Investigating thick (5.3 nm}) and thin (0.5 nm) molybdenum films, we demonstrate that in both cases, PMA was established in bilayer structures without any thermal annealing. Also, we demonstrate how an additional silicon layer grown over the CoFeB/Mo bilayer can critically alter the magnetic properties of the sample. Such studies are possible only through the unique combination of the growth method with the in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry measurement technique. We believe that this approach will open up broad opportunities for the development and investigation of new spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of zero coefficient of friction above a critical pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-superlubricity is a highly anticipated phenomenon where certain solid pairs in contact, without lubricant, exhibit zero wear and virtually null static friction and coefficient of friction (CoF). We present the first experimental observation of self-superlubricity in a microscale single-crystalline graphite flake in contact with a nanoscale-rough Au substrate, achieved when the applied normal pressure exceeds a critical threshold. Theoretical analysis revealed that substrate roughness impedes full contact at low pressures, but increasing the pressure induces a transition to full contact, enabling self-superlubricity. We established a dimensionless criterion for this critical pressure, further validated by observing self-superlubricity between graphite and an atomically smooth sapphire substrate without requiring additional pressure. This breakthrough introduces a transformative principle for next-generation microsystems such as micro/nanoscale generators, motors, oscillators, sensors, etc., enabling reduced power consumption and extended operational lifetimes in applications such as 6G communication, humanoid robotics, and unmanned aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Probing Non-Hermitian Spectral Transition and Eigenstate Skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems exhibit intricate spectral topology arising from complex-valued eigenenergies, with positive/negative imaginary parts representing gain/loss. Unlike the orthogonal eigenstates of Hermitian systems, NH systems feature left and right eigenstates that form a biorthogonal basis and can differ significantly, showcasing pronounced skewness between them. These characteristics give rise to unique properties absent in Hermitian systems, such as the NH skin effect and ultra spectral sensitivity. However, conventional experimental techniques are inadequate for directly measuring the complex-valued spectra and left and right eigenstates -- key elements for enhancing our knowledge of NH physics. This challenge is particularly acute in higher-dimensional NH systems, where the spectra and eigenstates are highly sensitive to macroscopic shapes, lattice geometry, and boundary conditions, posing greater experimental demands compared to one-dimensional systems. Here, we present a Green's function-based method that enables the direct measurement and characterization of both complex-valued energy spectra and the left and right eigenstates in arbitrary NH lattices. Using active acoustic crystals as the experimental platform, we observe spectral transitions and eigenstate skewness in two-dimensional NH lattices under both nonreciprocal and reciprocal conditions, with varied geometries and boundary conditions. Our approach renders complex spectral topology and left eigenstates experimentally accessible and practically meaningful, providing new insights into these quantities. The results not only confirm recent theoretical predictions of higher-dimensional NH systems but also establish a universal and versatile framework for investigating complex spectral properties and NH dynamics across a wide range of physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Pb-intercalated epitaxial graphene on SiC: Full insight into band structure and orbital character of interlayer Pb, and charge transfer into graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercalation is a robust approach for modulating the properties of epitaxial graphene on SiC and stabilizing two-dimensional (2D) intercalant layers at the graphene/SiC interface. In this work, we present synchrotron-based angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements focussing on the band structure of intercalated Pb under a single layer of epitaxial graphene. The interlayer Pb exhibits a metallic character, a $(1 \times 1)$ registry with respect to SiC, and free electron-like bands to a first order. Divergences from the free electron approximation include various band splittings and gaps throughout the Pb Brillouin zone. Light polarization dependent ARPES measurements indicate a predominant out-of-plane orbital character for the Pb bands, suggesting potential interactions between the interlayer Pb and graphene's $\pi$ orbitals that may induce proximity effects in graphene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a $(1 \times 1)$ Pb monolayer on SiC show a reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed interlayer bands as well as the polarization dependent measurements. Finally, temperature dependent ARPES measurements reveal that the nearly charge-neutral graphene layer involves charge transfer from both the interlayer Pb and the substrate SiC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered materials with non-centrosymmetric stacking order are attracting increasing interest due to the presence of ferroelectric polarization, which is dictated by weak interlayer hybridization of atomic orbitals. Here, we use density functional theory modelling to systematically build a library of van der Waals chalcogenides that exhibit substantial ferroelectric polarization. For the most promising materials, we also analyse the pressure dependence of the ferroelectric effect and charge accumulation of photo-induced electrons and holes at surfaces and internal twin boundaries in thin films of such materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analogy of optical waveguides, we investigate the guided modes in graphene waveguides, which is made of symmetric quantum well. The unique properties of the graphene waveguide are discussed based on the two different dispersion relations, which correspond to classical motion and Klein tunneling, respectively. It is shown that the third-order mode is absent in the classical motion, while the fundamental mode is absent in the Klein tunneling case. We hope these phenomena can lead to the potential applications in graphene-based quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address weak-coupling frictional sliding with phononic dissipation by means of analytic many-body techniques.
  Our model consists of a particle (the "slider") moving through a two- or three-dimensional crystal and interacting weakly with its atoms, and therefore exciting phonons.
  By means of linear-response theory we obtain explicit expressions for the friction force slowing down the slider as a function of its speed, and compare them to the friction obtained by simulations, demonstrating a remarkable accord.</description>

      <title>Tunable lateral displacement and spin beam splitter for ballistic electrons in two-dimensional magnetic-electric nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the lateral displacements for ballistic electron beams in a two-dimensional electron gas modulated by metallic ferromagnetic (FM) stripes with parallel and antiparallel (AP) magnetization configurations. It is shown that the displacements are negative as well as positive, which can be controlled by adjusting the electric potential induced by the applied voltage and the magnetic field strength of FM stripes. Based on these phenomena, we propose an efficient way to realize a spin beam splitter, which can completely separate spin-up and spin-down electron beams in the AP configuration by their corresponding spatial positions.</description>

      <title>Integer Quantum Hall Effect: Disorder, temperature, floating, and plateau width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically consider disorder and temperature effects on the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) using a variety of distinct and complementary analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, we address simple, physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there "floating" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We discuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest future experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and temperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an intricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE plateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder. Both must be considered on an equal footing in understanding IQHE experiments.</description>

      <title>Frequency Fluctuations in Nanomechanical Resonators due to Quantum Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators promise diverse applications ranging from mass spectrometry to quantum information processing, requiring long phonon lifetimes and frequency stability. Although two-level system (TLS) defects govern dissipation at millikelvin temperatures, the nature of frequency fluctuations remains poorly understood. In nanoscale devices, where acoustic fields are confined to sub-wavelength volumes, strong coupling to individual TLS should dominate over weak coupling to defect ensembles. In this work, we monitor fast frequency fluctuations of phononic crystal nanomechanical resonators, while varying temperature ($10$ mK$-1$ K), drive power ($10^2-10^5$ phonons), and the phononic band structure. We consistently observe random telegraph signals (RTS) which we attribute to state transitions of individual TLS. The frequency noise is well-explained by mechanical coupling to individual far off-resonant TLS, which are either thermally excited or strongly coupled to thermal fluctuators. Understanding this fundamental decoherence process, particularly its RTS structure, opens a clear path towards noise suppression for quantum and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Surface and Bulk Two-Level System Losses in Lithium Niobate Acoustic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) is a promising material for building acoustic resonators used in quantum applications, but its performance is limited by poorly understood material defects called two-level systems (TLS). In this work, we fabricate high-performance acoustic resonators from LN with quality factors up to $6\times10^7$ and use them to separate bulk and surface contributions to TLS loss. By comparing these bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators with previous surface acoustic wave and phononic crystal studies, we show that devices with high surface participation ratios are limited by surface TLS, while our BAW devices reveal an intrinsic bulk TLS limit. Through systematic surface treatments and microscopy, we demonstrate that BAW resonator performance remains unchanged despite surface modifications, confirming operation in a bulk-limited regime. Our work establishes quantitative bounds on both surface and bulk TLS losses in LN, within the context of material growth and fabrication approaches we have pursued, and provides guidance for future device engineering and materials development.</description>

      <title>Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Compact pulsed laser deposition system for in-situ polarized neutron reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of ferromagnet/heavy metal thin-film structures, such as CoFeB/Mo, with spin-orbit interaction requires advanced methods for their production and study. Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides unique insights into the evolution of magnetic properties, especially when applied in-situ during the growth process. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile method for producing magnetic thin films, and combining PLD with in-situ PNR measurements offers new possibilities for their investigation. In this work, we developed a compact vacuum chamber integrated into the neutron instrument, enabling step-by-step deposition and in-situ PNR measurements. A multilayer Mo/[CoFeB/Mo]12 structure was grown, and neutron reflectivity curves measured after each cycle revealed the gradual evolution of sample properties. A weak magnetic field response suggested the potential formation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at CoFeB/Mo interfaces. Additionally, a single CoFeB film was annealed up to 450{\deg}C, followed by the deposition of a ~5 {\AA} Mo layer. PNR measurements in magnetic fields of 0.01 T and 0.75 T showed a significant increase in in-plane magnetization, confirming PMA formation. Thus, we demonstrate the first successful operation of a combined PLD and in-situ PNR system, showcasing its capabilities for characterizing single-layer CoFeB and multilayer CoFeB/Mo thin-film structures.</description>

      <title>Guiding polaritonic energy and momentum through two-dimensional Bravais lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong exciton absorption in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides provides a promising platform for studying polaritons with tunable dispersions, which are crucial for controlling polaritonic energy and momentum, but remain underexplored. In this work, monolayer MoS$_2$ is coupled with a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity to form polaritons. Five types of Bravais lattices with sub-wavelength periods, based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopillars, are intentionally designed. The energy overlap between the periodic PMMA scattering wave and the polariton establishes a coupling channel that controls the directional flow of polaritonic energy, as demonstrated through angle-resolved reflectance measurements. Back-space image measurements further demonstrate that the dispersion in reciprocal space can be directly and manually tuned, allowing for control over their number and their positions. The coupling between the polariton and PMMA scattering wave is further demonstrated by analyzing the reflectance using the two-port two-mode model. The symmetries of 2D Bravais lattices allow the angle between energy and momentum flow to vary widely, from 90{\deg}, 60{\deg}, 45{\deg}, and 30{\deg} to arbitrary values. By adjusting the lattice vector lengths, the position of the dispersion branch in a specific direction can be fine-tuned, enabling full-range control over polariton dispersion. This work presents the first theoretical and experimental demonstrations of guiding the direction of polaritonic energy and momentum through Bravais lattice design.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling and phonon dynamics in single-layer NbSe$_2$ on graphene: the role of moir\'e phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between substrate interactions and electron-phonon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) materials presents a significant challenge in understanding and controlling their electronic properties. Here, we present a comparative study of the structural characteristics, phonon dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in bulk and monolayer NbSe$_2$ on epitaxial bilayer graphene (BLG) using helium atom scattering (HAS). High-resolution helium diffraction reveals a (9x9)0$^{\circ}$ superstructure within the NbSe$_2$ monolayer, commensurate with the BLG lattice, while out-of-plane HAS diffraction spectra indicate a low-corrugated (3$\sqrt{3}$x3$\sqrt{3}$)30$^{\circ}$ substructure. By monitoring the thermal attenuation of the specular peak across a temperature range of 100 K to 300 K, we determined the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda_{HAS}$ as 0.76 for bulk 2H-NbSe$_2$. In contrast, the NbSe$_2$ monolayer on graphene exhibits a reduced $\lambda_{HAS}$ of 0.55, corresponding to a superconducting critical temperature (T$_C$) of 1.56 K according to the MacMillan formula, consistent with transport measurement findings. Inelastic HAS data provide, besides a set of dispersion curves of acoustic and lower optical phonons, a soft, dispersionless branch of phonons at 1.7 meV, attributed to the interface localized defects distributed with the superstructure period, and thus termed moir\'e phonons. Our data show that moir\'e phonons contribute significantly to the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$. These results highlight the crucial role of the BLG on the electron-phonon coupling in monolayer NbSe$_2$, attributed to enhanced charge transfer effects, providing valuable insights into substrate-dependent electronic interactions in 2D superconductors.</description>

      <title>Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort Carbon Nanotubes with Luminescent Color Centers are Ultrabright NIR-II Nano-Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining brightness and nanoscale size of short-wave infrared (SWIR) emitters is equally essential in the fields of bioimaging, photonics, and quantum science, but such nano-emitters are still lacking. Here we report that when functionalized with luminescent color centers, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with lengths much shorter than 100 nm, are surprisingly bright in the near-infrared second-biological window (NIR-II) of the SWIR. We discuss the origin of this exceptional brightness based on the uncontrollable presence of quenching defects in solubilized carbon nanotubes. The observed NIR-II brightness exceeds that of well-known visible emitters, including quantum dots. After being made biocompatible, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with luminescent color centers open the route toward point-spread function engineering and 3-dimensional single-particle studies for nanoscale NIR-II imaging in thick brain tissue.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Optically and Magnetically Active Edges in Phosphorene Nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoribbons - nanometer wide strips of a two-dimensional material - are a unique system in condensed matter physics. They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times, quantum confinement and topologically protected states can emerge. An exciting prospect for this new material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge. This combination of magnetism and semiconducting properties is the first step in unlocking spin-based electronics such as non-volatile transistors, a route to low-energy computing, and has thus far typically only been observed in doped semiconductor systems and/or at low temperatures. Here, we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). Static (SQUID) and dynamic (EPR) magnetization probes demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs exhibit macroscopic magnetic properties, arising from their edge, with internal fields of ~ 250 to 800 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at modest sub-1T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that upon photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funneled to a dark-exciton state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a unique candidate system for studying the interplay of magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Dispersive nodal fermions along grain boundaries in Floquet topological crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven quantum materials often feature emergent topology, otherwise absent in static crystals. Dynamic bulk-boundary correspondence, encoded by nondissipative gapless modes residing near the Floquet zone center and/or boundaries, is its most prominent example. Here we show that topologically robust gapless dispersive modes appear along the grain boundaries, embedded in the interior of Floquet topological crystals, when the Floquet-Bloch band inversion occurring at a finite momentum (${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv}$) and the Burgers vector (${\bf b}$) of the constituting array of dislocations satisfy ${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv} \cdot {\bf b}=\pi$ (modulo $2 \pi$). Such nondissipative gapless states can be found near the center and/or edges of the Floquet Brillouin zone, irrespective of the drive protocol. We showcase these general outcomes for two-dimensional driven time-reversal symmetry breaking insulators. Promising experimental platforms hosting such dynamic topological dispersive bands in real materials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced phase transitions in double HgTe quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the self-consistent Born approximation, we investigate topological phase transitions in double HgTe quantum wells (QWs) induced by the short-range impurities. Following the evolution of the density-of-states and the spectral function, we demonstrate multiple closings and openings of the band-gap with the increase of the disorder strength due to the mutual inversions between the first and second electron-like and hole-like subbands. We show that starting from a band insulator in the clean limit, under the influence of disorder, the double HgTe QW undergoes a transition, first into a semimetal state similar to "bilayer graphene", and then into a high-order topological insulator state with a double band inversion. We find out that all disorder-induced transitions can be fully characterized by introducing a non-Hermitian quasiparticle Hamiltonian encoding the band structure renormalization and quasiparticle decay.</description>

Abstract: A Josephson junction, formed between two phase-biased superconductors and a normal metal, hosts a discrete spectrum of Andreev bound states (ABS). In this paper, we develop a theory for long ballistic Andreev interferometers in two-dimensional metals. We consider three frameworks in our theoretical analysis: (i) perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitudes; (ii) non-perturbative transport theory; and (iii) physically motivated approximations to visualize the conductance maps in the (flux, voltage) plane. We find a non-standard phase-sensitive Andreev reflection process in ballistic interferometers that couples the supercurrent to the non-equilibrium populations of the ABS in the normal region. Furthermore, our model shows that conductance spectroscopy follows the spectrum of the ABS in long junctions. We also discuss our results in terms of the semiclassical theory, the classical orbits being the one-dimensional Andreev tubes. Our theoretical analysis captures the results of recent experiments by the Penn State and Harvard groups.</description>

      <title>Controllable photocurrent generation in Dirac systems with two frequency drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in Dirac and Weyl semimetals under two-frequency light irradiation. We show that the BPVE emerges for centrosymmetric Dirac and Weyl semimetals in the presence of light fields with frequencies $\Omega$ and $2\Omega$. The BPVE under the two frequency drive involves both shift current contribution independent of the carriers lifetime $\tau$ and the injection current contribution $\propto \tau$. Our calculations indicate that the photocurrent's direction, magnitude and type can be dynamically controlled by tuning parameters of the driving fields. Furthermore, we find that the tilt of the Dirac cone significantly affects the photocurrent, particularly in mirror symmetry-lacking Weyl semimetals, leading to an anisotropic optical response. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic control of photocurrents in topological semimetals, offering promising applications for optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous conductance steps in 3D TI HgTe-based quantum point contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore electrical transport through a point contact in strained HgTe, a three-dimensional topological insulator. In the absence of a magnetic field $B$, there is no quantization. However, under higher magnetic fields, we observe distinct non-integer conductance steps. Based on numerical tight-binding calculations and a phenomenological Landauer-B\"uttiker approach, we attribute these atypical, non-integer quantized plateaus to significant scattering effects at the point contact.</description>

      <title>Tuning the lasing threshold of quantum well exciton-polaritons under a magnetic field in Faraday geometry: a theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamics and the Ericsson nano engine -- Efficiency from equilibrium results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study an Ericsson cycle whose working substance is a charged (quantum) oscillator in a magnetic field that is coupled to a heat bath. The resulting quantum Langevin equations with built-in noise terms encapsulate a thermodynamic structure and allow for the computation of the efficiency of the cycle. We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be tuned to a maximum. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger cat states of a nuclear spin qudit in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum systems are a valuable resource for quantum information processing. They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, which has been demonstrated using continuous-variable states in microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. For example, high-dimensional systems can be used to realise `Schr\"{o}dinger cat' states, superpositions of widely displaced coherent states that can also be used to illustrate quantum effects at large scales. Recent proposals have suggested encoding qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, finite-dimensional systems that can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schrodinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of an antimony atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the symmetry of the qudit, and constitute logical Pauli operations for qubits encoded in the Schrodinger cat states. Our work demonstrates the ability to prepare and control nonclassical resource states, a prerequisite for applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction using our scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform.</description>

      <title>Role of Quantum Coherence in Kinetic Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kinetic Uncertainty Relation (KUR) bounds the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic currents in terms of the number of transitions per unit time, known as the dynamical activity. This bound was derived in a classical context, and can be violated in the quantum regime due to coherent effects. However, the precise connection between KUR violations and quantum coherence has so far remained elusive, despite significant investigation. In this work, we solve this problem by deriving a modified bound that exactly pinpoints how, and when, coherence might lead to KUR violations. Our bound is sensitive to the specific kind of unraveling of the quantum master equation. It therefore allows one to compare quantum jumps and quantum diffusion, and understand, in each case, how quantum coherence affects fluctuations. We illustrate our result on a double quantum dot, where the electron current is monitored either by electron jump detection or with continuous diffusive charge measurement.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature phase-flip rate in a biased parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.</description>
