      <title>Quantum-Inspired Approach to Analyzing Complex System Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum information-inspired framework for analyzing complex systems through multivariate time series. In this approach the system's state is encoded into a density matrix, providing a compact representation of higher-order correlations and dependencies. This formulation enables precise quantification of the relative influence among time series, tracking of their response to external perturbations and also the definition of a recovery timescale without need for dimensional reduction. By leveraging tools such as fidelity from quantum information theory, our method naturally captures higher-order co-fluctuations beyond pairwise statistics, offering a holistic characterization of resilience and similarity in high-dimensional dynamics. We validate this approach on synthetic data generated by a 9-dimensional modified Lorenz-96 model and demonstrate its utility on real-world climate data, analyzing global temperature anomalies across nine regions, quantifying the dissimilarity of each 288-month time window up to July 2025 relative to the 1850-1874 baseline period.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description>
