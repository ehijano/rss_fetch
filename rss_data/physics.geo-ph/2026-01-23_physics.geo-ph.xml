      <title>Low-magnitude seismic activity between the Kamchatka July 20 and July 29, 2025, earthquakes. Spatio-temporal evolution recovered using waveform cross-correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M8.8 Kamchatka earthquake on July 29, 2025 was one of the largest in the first quarter of the 21st century. It deserves a thorough analysis including the preparation process. A smaller M7.4 earthquake occurred on July 20 with its epicenter within the confidence ellipse for the July 29 event. The aftershock sequence of the July 20 earthquake and the evolution of seismicity within the Kamchatka Peninsula region during 10 days period before the July 29 event may provide important information on the earthquake preparation and initiation processes. The CTBTO's International Monitoring System is one of the most sensitive global seismic networks comprising high-resolution array stations with enhanced sensitivity relative to three-component stations at the same locations. The International Data Centre of the CTBTO processes IMS data automatically and interactively to create a Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB), which serves as a source of information for the International Seismological Centre. Waveform cross-correlation (WCC) allows for additional detection capabilities to the IMS data and IDC processing when repeated seismicity is analyzed. The aftershock sequence of the July 20 earthquake is recovered using the WCC-based detection and phase association techniques as applied to the IMS data in order to accurately describe the spatio-temporal evolution of seismic process just before the July 29 event. With the reduced detection threshold, smaller events are found in the zones where the REB has no located sources. This finding opens up the possibility for a more detailed study of seismic and mechanical processes before the July 29 mainshock.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Viscoacoustic Wave Propagation: Forward Modelling, Inversion and Discretization Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic wave forward and inverse modeling are fundamental tools for subsurface imaging and geological hazard assessment. Conventional grid-based numerical methods, such as finite-difference and finite-element approaches, often require dense discretization and repeated forward simulations, leading to high computational cost in inverse problems. Although deep learning has shown promise in seismic applications, its performance is commonly limited by the need for large labeled datasets and weak enforcement of physical constraints.
  In this study, we propose a unified physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for forward modeling and parameter inversion of viscoacoustic wave propagation. By embedding the viscoacoustic wave equation into the learning process, the proposed framework accurately reproduces wavefields, attenuation, and phase characteristics, while enabling the simultaneous inversion of velocity and attenuation parameters from temporally sparse observations.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that the PINN approach achieves stable and reliable accuracy compared with finite-difference solutions, while exhibiting reduced sensitivity to spatial discretization. These results highlight the potential of PINNs as a data-efficient and physically consistent alternative for high-resolution seismic modeling and inversion in attenuative media.</description>

      <title>Distance-Independent Atmospheric Refraction Correction for Accurate Retrieval of Fireball Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>

      <title>Quantitative mobile gamma-ray spectrometry through Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative mapping of gamma-ray sources is critical for applications ranging from radiological emergency response and environmental monitoring to nuclear security and deep space exploration. Here, we show that integrating high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference with mobile gamma-ray spectrometry enables rapid and accurate quantification of distributed and point-like gamma-ray sources. Validated against laboratory and field assays, our framework quantifies natural and anthropogenic gamma-ray sources that conventional methods cannot resolve in $1\,$s with $\sim\!\!1\,\%$ error. The developed method marks a critical advance in quantitative gamma-ray sensing, enabling improved radiological situational awareness, enhanced terrestrial geophysical and geochemical mapping, as well as more robust constraints on radionuclide abundances on extraterrestrial bodies across the Solar System.</description>
