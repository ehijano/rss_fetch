      <title>Thermodynamics of mixtures with strongly negative deviations from Raoult's law. XVII. Permittivities and refractive indices for alkan-1-ol + N,N-diethylethanamine systems at (293.15-303.15) K. Application of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative permittivities at 1 MHz, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}$, at 0.1 MPa and (293.15-303.15) K and refractive indices, $n_{\text{D}}$, at similar conditions have been measured for the alkan-1-ol (methanol, propan-1-ol, butan-1-ol, pentan-1-ol or heptan-1-ol) + N,N-diethylethanamine (TEA) systems. Positive values of the excess permittivities, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ , are encountered for the methanol system at high alcohol concentrations. The remaining mixtures are characterized by negative $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ values over the whole composition range. At ${\phi}_1$ (volume fraction) = 0.5, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ changes in the order: methanol &gt; propan-1-ol &gt; butan-1-ol &lt; pentan-1-ol &lt; heptan-1-ol. Mixtures formed by alkan-1-ol and an isomeric amine, hexan-1-amine (HxA) or N-propylpropan-1-amine (DPA) or cyclohexylamine, behave similarly. This has been explained in terms of the lower and weaker self-association of longer alkan-1-ols. From the permittivity data, it is shown that: (i) (alkan-1-ol)-TEA interactions contribute positively to $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$; (ii) TEA is an effective breaker of the network of the alkan-1-ols; (iii) structural effects, which are very important for the volumetric and calorimetric data of alkan-1-ol + TEA systems, are also relevant when evaluating dielectric data. This is confirmed by the comparison of $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ measurements for alkan-1-ol + aliphatic amine mixtures; (iv) the aromaticity effect (i.e., the replacement of TEA by pyridine in systems with a given alkan-1-ol) leads to an increase of the mixture polarization. Calculations conducted in the framework of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model are consistent with the previous statements.</description>

      <title>Density, speed of sound, refractive index and relative permittivity of methanol, propan-1-ol or pentan-1-ol + benzylamine liquid mixtures. Application of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Densities ($\rho$), speeds of sound ($c$), relative permittivities at 1 MHz ($\varepsilon_{\text{r}}$) and refractive indices at the sodium D-line ($n_{\text{D}}$) at $T$ = (293.15 K to 303.15 K) and $p$ = 0.1 MPa are reported for binary liquid mixtures alkan-1-ol + benzylamine. Methanol, propan-1-ol and pentan-1-ol are the alkan-1-ols studied in this work. The values of the excess molar volume ($V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$), excess isentropic compressibility ($\kappa_S^{\text{E}}$), excess speed of sound ($c^{\text{E}}$), excess refractive index ($n_{\text{D}}^{\text{E}}$), excess relative permittivity ($\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$) and its temperature derivative ${(\partial{\varepsilon_{\text{r}}}/\partial T)}_p$ are calculated, and they are adjusted to Redlich-Kister polynomials. The $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values are negative, indicating a predominance of the solvation between unlike molecules and structural effects. $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ values indicate a positive contribution from the creation of (alkan-1-ol)-benzylamine interactions, and the positive value for the methanol mixture emphasises the importance of solvation. Calculations on excess molar refractions point out to weaker dispersive interactions than in the ideal mixture, which may be explained by the mentioned solvation effects. The Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model has been applied to the mixtures, and the Kirkwood correlation factors suggest an important relative weight, especially in the methanol system, of linear-like molecules in the solutions, which is in accordance with the positive contribution of the formed multimers to $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ due to their good effective response to the electric field.</description>

      <title>Many-body Expansion Based Machine Learning Models for Octahedral Transition Metal Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based machine learning models for materials properties show great potential to accelerate virtual high-throughput screening of large chemical spaces. However, in their simplest forms, graph-based models do not include any 3D information and are unable to distinguish stereoisomers such as those arising from different orderings of ligands around a metal center in coordination complexes. In this work we present a modification to revised autocorrelation descriptors, our molecular graph featurization method for machine learning various spin state dependent properties of octahedral transition metal complexes (TMCs). Inspired by analytical semi-empirical models for TMCs, the new modeling strategy is based on the many-body expansion (MBE) and allows one to tune the captured stereoisomer information by changing the truncation order of the MBE. We present the necessary modifications to include this approach in two commonly used machine learning methods, kernel ridge regression and feed-forward neural networks. On a test set composed of all possible isomers of binary transition metal complexes, the best MBE models achieve mean absolute errors of 2.75 kcal/mol on spin-splitting energies and 0.26 eV on frontier orbital energy gaps, a 30-40% reduction in error compared to models based on our previous approach. We also observe improved generalization to previously unseen ligands where the best-performing models exhibit mean absolute errors of 4.00 kcal/mol (i.e., a 0.73 kcal/mol reduction) on the spin-splitting energies and 0.53 eV (i.e., a 0.10 eV reduction) on the frontier orbital energy gaps. Because the new approach incorporates insights from electronic structure theory, such as ligand additivity relationships, these models exhibit systematic generalization from homoleptic to heteroleptic complexes, allowing for efficient screening of TMC search spaces.</description>

      <title>Inference of non-exponential kinetics through stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an inference scheme of long timescale, non-exponential kinetics from Molecular Dynamics simulations accelerated by stochastic resetting. Standard simulations provide valuable insight into chemical processes but are limited to timescales shorter than $\sim 1 \mu s$. Slower processes require the use of enhanced sampling methods to expedite them, and inference schemes to obtain the unbiased kinetics. However, most kinetics inference schemes assume an underlying exponential first-passage time distribution and are inappropriate for other distributions, e.g., with a power-law decay. We propose an inference scheme that is designed for such cases, based on simulations enhanced by stochastic resetting. We show that resetting promotes enhanced sampling of the first-passage time distribution at short timescales, but often also provides sufficient information to estimate the long-time asymptotics, which allows the kinetics inference. We apply our method to a model system and a short peptide in an explicit solvent, successfully estimating the unbiased mean first-passage time while accelerating the sampling by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A data-driven sparse learning approach to reduce chemical reaction mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduction of detailed chemical reaction mechanisms is one of the key methods for mitigating the computational cost of reactive flow simulations. Exploitation of species and elementary reaction sparsity ensures the compactness of the reduced mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel sparse statistical learning approach for chemical reaction mechanism reduction. Specifically, the reduced mechanism is learned to explicitly reproduce the dynamical evolution of detailed chemical kinetics, while constraining on the sparsity of the reduced reactions at the same time. Compact reduced mechanisms are be achieved as the collection of species that participate in the identified important reactions. We validate our approach by reducing oxidation mechanisms for $n$-heptane (194 species) and 1,3-butadiene (581 species). The results demonstrate that the reduced mechanisms show accurate predictions for the ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, species mole fraction profiles and turbulence-chemistry interactions across a wide range of operating conditions. Comparative analysis with directed relation graph (DRG)-based methods and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods reveals that our sparse learning approach produces reduced mechanisms with fewer species while maintaining the same error limits. The advantages are particularly evident for detailed mechanisms with a larger number of species and reactions. The sparse learning strategy shows significant potential in achieving more substantial reductions in complex chemical reaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Double Configuration Interaction Singles: Scalable and size-intensive approach for orbital relaxation in excited states and bond-dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09912v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical scheme for orbital optimization in configuration interaction singles (CIS) based on a perturbative treatment of its electronic Hessian, whose analytical derivation is also established in this work. The proposed method, which can be interpreted as a "CIS-then-CIS" scheme, variationally accounts for orbital relaxation in excited states, thus significantly reducing the overestimation of charge-transfer excitation energies commonly associated with standard CIS. Additionally, by incorporating de-excitation effects from CIS, we demonstrate that our approach effectively describes single bond dissociation. Notably, all these improvements are achieved at a mean-field cost, with the pre-factor further reduced with the efficient algorithm introduced here, while preserving the size-intensive property of CIS.</description>

      <title>Nudged-Elastic Band Calculations of Polymorph Transitions and Solid-State Reactions in Molecular Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of solid-state transformations, such as polymorphic transitions and chemical reactions in molecular crystals, is vital for many applications like drug design or the development of new synthesis methods but faces several crucial challenges. First, the automatic initial pathway generation in terms of nudged-elastic band (NEB) calculations based on a linear interpolation often fails for periodic systems, leading to unrealistic geometries and atomic collisions. Second, the necessary system sizes are typically beyond the scope of density functional theory (DFT) calculations in terms of computational cost, but the associated accuracy is vitally needed. To address these issues, we introduce a novel hybrid interpolation method that combines linear interpolation for cell parameters with spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) for molecular structures or intramolecular fragments, ensuring smooth and realistic transitions. In addition, we also benchmark the accuracy of the recently introduced SO3krates machine-learned force field (MLFF) architecture in this context, which has the potential to substantially improve the computational efficiency. We apply these methods to two polymorph transitions and a solid-state Diels-Alder reaction and show the applicability of our interpolation method. Furthermore, we find excellent agreement of MLFF results with DFT energy barriers and pathways, when trained on appropriate reference data, potentially paving the way for more automated explorations of solid-state transformations in molecular crystals.</description>

      <title>Dual-Path Mechanism of Amino Acid Racemization Mediated by Quantum Mechanical Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The racemization of amino acids constitutes one of the most elemental and critical reactions, holding primitive significance for understanding the life's origin and maintenance. Nevertheless, its mechanism at the atomic level has been persistently misunderstood for more than a century. In this work, we demonstrate that the racemization of amino acid molecules in aqueous environments can occur simultaneously by two pathways via the carboxyl (COOH) and amino (NH2) groups. Behind this result, the quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) effect plays a pivotal role, as evidenced by the tunneling hindrance of the NH2 reaction and the tunneling enhancement of the COOH reaction. Notably, the disparity in the QMT effect leads to a crossover between the COOH and NH2 reactions within 200-257 K, such that NH2 reactions dominate at high temperatures and COOH reactions dominate at low temperatures. Our work emphasizes the significance of QMT effect in the racemization of amino acids and therefore introduces a dual-path coexistence mechanism, offering valuable insights into the origin of homochirality in extreme environments of the early Earth.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann priors for Implicit Transfer Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of thermodynamic properties is essential in drug discovery and materials science. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a principled approach to this task, yet they typically rely on prohibitively long sequential simulations. Implicit Transfer Operator (ITO) Learning offers a promising approach to address this limitation by enabling stable simulation with time steps orders of magnitude larger than MD. However, to train ITOs, we need extensive, unbiased MD data, limiting the scope of this framework. Here, we introduce Boltzmann Priors for ITO (BoPITO) to enhance ITO learning in two ways. First, BoPITO enables more efficient data generation, and second, it embeds inductive biases for long-term dynamical behavior, simultaneously improving sample efficiency by one order of magnitude and guaranteeing asymptotically unbiased equilibrium statistics. Further, we showcase the use of BoPITO in a new tunable sampling protocol interpolating ITO models trained on off-equilibrium simulation data and an unbiased equilibrium distribution to solve inverse problems in molecular science.</description>

      <title>Random sampling versus active learning algorithms for machine learning potentials of quantum liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training accurate machine learning potentials requires electronic structure data comprehensively covering the configurational space of the system of interest. As the construction of this data is computationally demanding, many schemes for identifying the most important structures have been proposed. Here, we compare the performance of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) for quantum liquid water at ambient conditions trained to data sets constructed using random sampling as well as various flavors of active learning based on query by committee. Contrary to the common understanding of active learning, we find that for a given data set size, random sampling leads to smaller test errors for structures not included in the training process. In our analysis we show that this can be related to small energy offsets caused by a bias in structures added in active learning, which can be overcome by using instead energy correlations as an error measure that is invariant to such shifts. Still, all HDNNPs yield very similar and accurate structural properties of quantum liquid water, which demonstrates the robustness of the training procedure with respect to the training set construction algorithm even when trained to as few as 200 structures. However, we find that for active learning based on preliminary potentials, a reasonable initial data set is important to avoid an unnecessary extension of the covered configuration space to less relevant regions.</description>

      <title>Microstructural Geometry Revealed by NMR Lineshape Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a technique for extracting microstructural geometry from NMR lineshape analysis in porous materials at angstrom-scale resolution with the use of weak magnetic field gradients. Diverging from the generally held view of FID signals undergoing simple exponential decay, we show that a detailed analysis of the line shape can unravel structural geometry on much smaller scales than previously thought. While the original q-space PFG NMR relies on strong magnetic field gradients in order to achieve high spatial resolution, our current approach reaches comparable or higher resolution using much weaker gradients. As a model system, we simulated gas diffusion for xenon confined within carbon nanotubes over a range of temperatures and nanotube diameters in order to unveil manifestations of confinement in the diffusion behavior. We report a multiscale scheme that couples the above MD simulations with the generalized Langevin equation to estimate the transport properties of interest for this problem, such as diffusivity coefficients and NMR lineshapes, using the Green-Kubo correlation function to correctly evaluate time-dependent diffusion. Our results highlight how NMR methodologies can be adapted as effective means towards structural investigation at very small scales when dealing with complicated geometries. This method is expected to find applications in materials science, catalysis, biomedicine and other areas.</description>

      <title>Modeling glasses from first-principles using random structure sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to modeling static properties of glasses without experimental inputs rooted in the first-principles random structure sampling. In our approach, the glassy system is represented by a collection of periodic, small-cell (few 10s of atoms) local minima on the potential energy surface. These are obtained by generating a set of periodic structures with random lattice parameters and random atomic positions, which are then relaxed to their closest local minima on the potential energy surface using the first-principles methods. Using vitreous SiO$_2$ as an example, we show how various properties calculated as averages over the set of such local minima reproduce well the experimental results including mass density, different reciprocal space and real space structure functions as well as the electronic density of states and the bulk modulus. The practical benefit of our approach is in that it transfers the computational burden to linearly scaling and easy to converge averages of properties computed on small-cell structures, rather than simulation cells with 100s if not 1000s of atoms. Because of this it enables the future use of high-cost/high-accuracy electronic structure methods thereby bringing modeling of glasses closer to the state of modeling of crystalline phases.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Trapped Nanocrystals with Symmetry-Preserving Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape of nanocrystals is crucial in determining their surface area, reactivity, optical properties, mechanical strength, and self-assembly behavior. Traditionally, shape control has been achieved through empirical methods, highlighting the need for a more refined theoretical framework. A comprehensive model should account for the kinetic factors at distinct stages of the shape-formation process to identify the key determinants of nanocrystal morphology. By modulating kinetics at terraces, ledges, and kinks, we reveal that the primary factors are the adatom nucleation energies and the geometry of growth islands. Transient sites dominate the growth process, leading to kinetically trapped, metastable shapes. We illustrate these concepts with face-centered cubic nanocrystals, demonstrating diverse shape evolutions, including surface roughening and the preservation of crystal symmetry in cubes, octahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and their truncated variants. This study reveals the mechanisms driving the formation of cubic nanocrystal shapes and offers guidance for their precise synthesis.</description>

      <title>Physical Consistency Bridges Heterogeneous Data in Molecular Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has demonstrated impressive capability in handling molecular science tasks. To support various molecular properties at scale, machine learning models are trained in the multi-task learning paradigm. Nevertheless, data of different molecular properties are often not aligned: some quantities, e.g. equilibrium structure, demand more cost to compute than others, e.g. energy, so their data are often generated by cheaper computational methods at the cost of lower accuracy, which cannot be directly overcome through multi-task learning. Moreover, it is not straightforward to leverage abundant data of other tasks to benefit a particular task. To handle such data heterogeneity challenges, we exploit the specialty of molecular tasks that there are physical laws connecting them, and design consistency training approaches that allow different tasks to exchange information directly so as to improve one another. Particularly, we demonstrate that the more accurate energy data can improve the accuracy of structure prediction. We also find that consistency training can directly leverage force and off-equilibrium structure data to improve structure prediction, demonstrating a broad capability for integrating heterogeneous data.</description>

      <title>Effective osmotic pressure of foams in short-term dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foams exhibit absorptive properties and are widely used for cleaning contaminants, oil recovery, and selective mineral extraction via froth flotation. Although foam absorption has historically been linked to equilibrium osmotic pressure, empirical observations show that drainage occurs at levels much lower than theoretical predictions. In this study, we investigate the effective osmotic pressure in foams. The experimental findings indicate that effective osmotic pressure is primarily influenced by short-term dynamics and is governed by the yield stress rather than equilibrium osmotic pressure. Gravity-induced flow drives bubble movement downward, subjecting the lower bubbles to increased pressure. Once the pressure exerted by the solution exceeds the yield stress, internal bubble rearrangement occurs, and drainage is promoted by the relaxation of inter-bubble repulsive forces. In contrast, below the yield stress, these repulsive forces suppress drainage. While foams have traditionally been modeled as immobile porous media, the reality involves kinematic coupling between the solution and the bubbles, which establishes yield stress as the key factor in determining effective osmotic pressure. This framework is also relevant to the dynamics of soft jammed systems, such as blood flow in vessels, emulsions, and biological tissues, offering significant advancements in the understanding of soft jammed system behavior.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Vibrational States of Double-Well Potentials in the Solid State from DFT Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general approach for the simulation of quantum vibrational states of (symmetric and asymmetric) double-well potentials in molecules and materials for thermodynamic and spectroscopic applications. The method involves solving the nuclear Schr\"odinger equation associated with a one-mode potential of the type $V (Q) = aQ^2 + bQ^3 + cQ^4$ (with $a &lt; 0$ and $c &gt; 0$), and thus explicitly includes nuclear quantum effects. The potential, $V (Q)$, is obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed at displaced nuclear configurations along the selected normal mode, $Q$. The strategy has been implemented into the CRYSTAL electronic structure package and allows for i) the use of many density functional approximations, including hybrid ones, and ii) integration with a quasi-harmonic module. The method is applied to the spectroscopic characterization of soft lattice modes in two phases of the molecular crystal of thiourea: a low-temperature ferroelectric phase and a high-temperature paraelectric phase. Signature peaks associated to structural changes between the two phases are found in the terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which exhibit strong anharmonic character in their thermal evolution, as measured by temperature-dependent terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RMs (reverse micelles) provide a controlled system for studying the unique structural and dynamic behaviors of confined water, thus gaining a general insight into the behavior or water under confinement and at interfaces. This study employs ESR (Electron Spin Resonance) to study the dynamics inside RMs and capitalizes on the fact that different preparations of RMs can precisely manipulate both the size of water pools as well as whether or not different pools can come into contact. A small spin label moiety, less than a half nanometer in size tumbles in solution, offering insight into the rotational diffusion from room temperature down to deeply super-cooled temperatures. Two different spin probes can separately probe the dynamics of the interfacial layer vs. those at the core of the reverse micelle. The results provide critical insights into how thermodynamic transitions affect the stability and behavior of water in confined spaces, enhancing the understanding of nucleation and ice crystal growth, as well as the broader understanding of confined water's role in various chemical and biological systems. The ability to more precisely understand and control reaction dynamics and thermodynamics inside confined aqueous systems across a broad range of temperatures will prove useful to fields ranging from biophysics to the development of new nano-materials.</description>

Abstract: Green's function theory has emerged as a powerful many-body approach not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum chemistry in recent years. We have developed a new all-electron implementation of the BSE@GW formalism using numeric atom-centered orbital basis sets (Liu et al., J. Chem. Phys. 152, 044105 (2020)). We present our recent developments in implementing this formalism for extended systems with periodic boundary conditions. We discuss its numerical implementation and various convergence tests pertaining to numerical atom-centered orbitals, auxiliary basis sets for the resolution-of-identity formalism, and Brillouin zone sampling. Proof-of-principle examples are presented to compare with other formalisms, illustrating the new all-electron BSE@GW method for extended systems.</description>

      <title>QeMFi: A Multifidelity Dataset of Quantum Chemical Properties of Diverse Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress in both Machine Learning (ML) and Quantum Chemistry (QC) methods have resulted in high accuracy ML models for QC properties. Datasets such as MD17 and WS22 have been used to benchmark these models at some level of QC method, or fidelity, which refers to the accuracy of the chosen QC method. Multifidelity ML (MFML) methods, where models are trained on data from more than one fidelity, have shown to be effective over single fidelity methods. Much research is progressing in this direction for diverse applications ranging from energy band gaps to excitation energies. One hurdle for effective research here is the lack of a diverse multifidelity dataset for benchmarking. We provide the Quantum chemistry MultiFidelity (QeMFi) dataset consisting of five fidelities calculated with the TD-DFT formalism. The fidelities differ in their basis set choice: STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, def2-SVP, and def2-TZVP. QeMFi offers to the community a variety of QC properties such as vertical excitation properties and molecular dipole moments, further including QC computation times allowing for a time benefit benchmark of multifidelity models for ML-QC.</description>

      <title>Extending GPU-Accelerated Gaussian Integrals in the TeraChem Software Package to f Type Orbitals: Implementation and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing availability of GPUs for scientific computing has prompted interest in accelerating quantum chemical calculations through their use. The complexity of integral kernels for high angular momentum basis functions however often limits the utility of GPU implementations with large basis sets or for metal containing systems. In this work, we report implementation of $f$ function support in the GPU-accelerated TeraChem software package through the development of efficient kernels for the evaluation of Hamiltonian integrals. The high efficiency of the resulting code is demonstrated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations on increasingly large organic molecules and transition metal complexes, as well as coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations on water clusters. Preliminary investigations into Ni(I) catalysis with DFT and the photochemistry of MnH(CH$_3$) with complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) are also carried out. Overall, our GPU-accelerated software appears to be well-suited for fast simulation of large transition metal containing systems, as well as organic molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first principles strategy for developing state-specific density functional approximations for excited states. We first clarify why approaches based on conventional ground state approximations miss density-driven correlations, by considering excited state physics through the lens of ensemble density functional theory. To solve this issue we gain insights on density driven correlations by exploiting the recently understood low-density limit of electrons in excited states. The theory developments are then combined to produce a proof-of-concept excited state approximation that resolves urgent paradigmatic failures (double excitations, charge transfer excitations, piecewise linearity) of existing state-of-art density-functional approaches, directly from differences of self-consistent field calculations; i.e., $\Delta$SCF. In light of its observed impressive performance, we conclude that the approach represents a major step toward unified and accurate modelling of neutral and charged excitations.</description>

      <title>Potential Distribution Theory of Alchemical Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical description of the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) for molecular binding using the Potential Distribution Theory (PDT) formalism. ATM models the binding free energy by mapping the bound and unbound states of the complex by translating the ligand coordinates. PDT relates the free energy and the probability densities of the perturbation energy along the alchemical path to the probability density at the initial state, which is the unbound state of the complex in the case of a binding process. Hence, the ATM probability density of the transfer energy at the unbound state is first related by a convolution operation of the probability densities for coupling the ligand to the solvent and coupling it to the solvated receptor--for which analytical descriptions are available--with parameters obtained from maximum likelihood analysis of data from double-decoupling alchemical calculations. PDT is then used to extend this analytical description along the alchemical transfer pathway. We tested the theory on the alchemical binding of five guests to the TEMOA host from the SAMPL8 benchmark set. In each case, the probability densities of the perturbation energy for transfer along the alchemical transfer pathway obtained from numerical calculations match those predicted from the theory and double-decoupling simulations. The work provides a solid theoretical foundation for alchemical transfer, offers physical insights on the form of the probability densities observed in alchemical transfer calculations, and confirms the conceptual and numerical equivalence between the alchemical transfer and double-decoupling processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of computational chemistry is increasingly leveraging machine learning (ML) potentials to predict molecular properties with high accuracy and efficiency, providing a viable alternative to traditional quantum mechanical (QM) methods, which are often computationally intensive. Central to the success of ML models is the quality and comprehensiveness of the data sets on which they are trained. Quantum chemistry data sets and databases, comprising extensive information on molecular structures, energies, forces, and other properties derived from QM calculations, are crucial for developing robust and generalizable ML potentials. In this review, we provide an overview of the current landscape of quantum chemical data sets and databases. We examine key characteristics and functionalities of prominent resources, including the types of information they store, the level of electronic structure theory employed, the diversity of chemical space covered, and the methodologies used for data creation. Additionally, an updatable resource is provided to track new data sets and databases at https://github.com/Arif-PhyChem/datasets_and_databases_4_MLPs. Looking forward, we discuss the challenges associated with the rapid growth of quantum chemical data sets and databases, emphasizing the need for updatable and accessible resources to ensure the long-term utility of them. We also address the importance of data format standardization and the ongoing efforts to align with the FAIR principles to enhance data interoperability and reusability. Drawing inspiration from established materials databases, we advocate for the development of user-friendly and sustainable platforms for these data sets and databases.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Dynamics of a Liquid in the Vicinity of an Attractive Surface: The Process of Escaping from the Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the displacements of the particles of a glass-forming molecular liquid perpendicular to a confining solid surface, using extensive molecular dynamics simulations with atomistic models. In the vicinity of an attractive surface, the liquid molecules are trapped. Transient localization of liquid molecules near the surface introduces a relaxation process, related to the escape of molecules from the surface, into the dynamics of the interfacial liquid layer. To describe this process, we analyze several dynamical observables of the confined liquid. The self-intermediate scattering function and the mean-squared displacement of the particles located in the interfacial layer are dominated by the process of escaping from the surface. This relaxation process is also associated with a strong heterogeneity in the mobility of the interfacial particles. The studied model liquid is hydrogenated methyl methacrylate. For the confining wall, we consider different models, namely a periodic single layer of graphene and a frozen amorphous configuration of the bulk liquid (frozen wall). Near graphene, where the liquid molecules form a layered structure and adopt parallel-to-surface orientation, a clear separation between small-scale movements of the molecules near the surface and the process of escaping from the surface is observed. This is reflected in the three-step relaxation of the interfacial layer. However, near the frozen wall, where the liquid molecules do not have a preferential alignment, a clear three-step relaxation is not seen, even though the dynamical quantities are controlled by the process of escaping from the surface.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Molecular Property Predictions from Small Data Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a new tool in chemistry to bypass expensive experiments or quantum-chemical calculations, for example, in high-throughput screening applications. However, many machine learning studies rely on small data sets, making it difficult to efficiently implement powerful deep learning architectures such as message passing neural networks. In this study, we benchmark common machine learning models for the prediction of molecular properties on two small data sets, for which the best results are obtained with the message passing neural network PaiNN, as well as SOAP molecular descriptors concatenated to a set of simple molecular descriptors tailored to gradient boosting with regression trees. To further improve the predictive capabilities of PaiNN, we present a transfer learning strategy that uses large data sets to pre-train the respective models and allows to obtain more accurate models after fine-tuning on the original data sets. The pre-training labels are obtained from computationally cheap ab initio or semi-empirical models and both data sets are normalized to mean zero and standard deviation one to align the labels' distributions. This study covers two small chemistry data sets, the Harvard Organic Photovoltaics data set (HOPV, HOMO-LUMO-gaps), for which excellent results are obtained, and on the Freesolv data set (solvation energies), where this method is less successful, probably due to a complex underlying learning task and the dissimilar methods used to obtain pre-training and fine-tuning labels. Finally, we find that for the HOPV data set, the final training results do not improve monotonically with the size of the pre-training data set, but pre-training with fewer data points can lead to more biased pre-trained models and higher accuracy after fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's h-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</description>
