      <title>The diverse and fair structures of growth with scale-free saturations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world growth processes and scalings have been broadly categorized into three growth regimes with distinctly different properties and driving forces. The first two are characterized by a positive and constant feedback between growth and growth rates which in the context of networks lead to scale-free or single-scale networks. The third, sublinear, regime is characteristic of biological scaling processes and those that that are driven by optimization and efficiency. These systems are characterized by a negative feedback in growth rates and as such naturally exhibit saturations, i.e., areas where growth ceases from a lack of resources. Motivated by this observation, we propose and analyze a simple network growth process that is analogous to this sublinear regime and characterize how its scale-free saturations impact the diversity and fairness of its structural properties and give rise to scaling relations observed throughout complex systems and science.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of COVID-19 Misinformation: An Analysis of Conspiracy Theories, Fake Remedies, and False Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper makes four scientific contributions to the area of misinformation detection and analysis on digital platforms, with a specific focus on investigating how conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports emerge, propagate, and shape public perceptions in the context of COVID-19. A dataset of 5,614 posts on the internet that contained misinformation about COVID-19 was used for this study. These posts were published in 2020 on 427 online sources (such as social media platforms, news channels, and online blogs) from 193 countries and in 49 languages. First, this paper presents a structured, three-tier analytical framework that investigates how multiple motives - including fear, politics, and profit - can lead to a misleading claim. Second, it emphasizes the importance of narrative structures, systematically identifying and quantifying the thematic elements that drive conspiracy theories, fake remedies, and false reports. Third, it presents a comprehensive analysis of different sources of misinformation, highlighting the varied roles played by individuals, state-based organizations, media outlets, and other sources. Finally, it discusses multiple potential implications of these findings for public policy and health communication, illustrating how insights gained from motive, narrative, and source analyses can guide more targeted interventions in the context of misinformation detection on digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Simple crowd dynamics to generate complex temporal contact networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical contact networks or interaction networks demonstrate peculiar characteristics stemming from the fundamental social, psychological, physical mechanisms governing human interactions. Although these mechanisms are complex, we test whether we are able to reproduce some dynamical properties of these empirical networks from relatively simple models. In this study, we perform simulations for a range of 2D models of particle dynamics, namely the Random Walk, Active Brownian Particles, and Vicsek models, to generate artificial contact networks. We investigate temporal properties of these contact networks: the distributions of contact durations, inter-contact durations and number of contact per pair of particle. We demonstrate that the distribution of inter-contact durations can be recovered by the dynamics of these simple crowd particle models, and show that it is simply related to the well-know first-return process, which explains the -3/2 exponent that is found in both the numerical models and empirical contact networks.</description>

      <title>The Waters We Swim In: Replicability and the Evolution of Scientific Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, a series of high-profile retractions and fraud cases have arisen in physics, sparking a conversation about research integrity and replicability. Here, we discuss how the practice of science is shaped by the social and political context in which it operates. Reflection on our norms and values could provide a route to create community-driven safeguards that respond to the changing demands in which our research occurs. We propose that collaborations between physicists, philosophers, social scientists, and historians of science could facilitate these reflections and provide new ideas for social science and humanities colleagues.</description>

      <title>Signed graphs in data sciences via communicability geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signed graphs are an emergent way of representing data in a variety of contexts where antagonistic interactions exist. These include data from biological, ecological, and social systems. Here we propose the concept of communicability for signed graphs and explore in depth its mathematical properties. We also prove that the communicability induces a hyperspherical geometric embedding of the signed network, and derive communicability-based metrics that satisfy the axioms of a distance even in the presence of negative edges. We then apply these metrics to solve several problems in the data analysis of signed graphs within a unified framework. These include the partitioning of signed graphs, dimensionality reduction, finding hierarchies of alliances in signed networks, and quantifying the degree of polarization between the existing factions in social systems represented by these types of graphs.</description>

      <title>Opinion-driven risk perception and reaction in SIS epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze a mathematical model to study the feedback between behavior and epidemic spread in a population that is actively assessing and reacting to risk of infection. In our model, a population dynamically forms an opinion that reflects its willingness to engage in risky behavior (e.g., not wearing a mask in a crowded area) or reduce it (e.g., social distancing). We consider SIS epidemic dynamics in which the contact rate within a population adapts as a function of its opinion. For the new coupled model, we prove the existence of two distinct parameter regimes. One regime corresponds to a low baseline infectiousness, and the equilibria of the epidemic spread are identical to those of the standard SIS model. The other regime corresponds to a high baseline infectiousness, and there is a bistability between two new endemic equilibria that reflect an initial preference towards either risk seeking behavior or risk aversion. We prove that risk seeking behavior increases the steady-state infection level in the population compared to the baseline SIS model, whereas risk aversion decreases it. When a population is highly reactive to extreme opinions, we show how risk aversion enables the complete eradication of infection in the population. Extensions of the model to a network of populations or individuals are explored numerically.</description>
