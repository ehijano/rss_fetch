      <title>The photography transforms and their analytic inversion formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light field reconstruction from the focal stack can be mathematically formulated as an ill-posed integral equation inversion problem. Although the previous research about this problem has made progress both in practice and theory, its forward problem and inversion in a general form still need to be studied. In this paper, to model the forward problem rigorously, we propose three types of photography transforms with different integral geometry characteristics that extend the forward operator to the arbitrary $n$-dimensional case. We prove that these photography transforms are equivalent to the Radon transform with the coupling relation between variables. We also obtain some properties of the photography transforms, including the Fourier slice theorem, the convolution theorem, and the convolution property of the dual operator, which are very similar to those of the classic Radon transform. Furthermore, the representation of the normal operator and the analytic inversion formula for the photography transforms are derived and they are quite different from those of the classic Radon transform.</description>

      <title>Duals of limiting interpolation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to establish duals of the limiting real interpolation $K$- and $J$-spaces $(X_0,X_1)_{0,q,v;K}$ and $(X_0,X_1)_{0,q,v;J}$, where $(X_0,X_1)$ is a compatible couple of Banach spaces, $1\le q&lt;\infty$, $v$ is a slowly varying function on the interval $(0,\infty)$, and the symbols $K$ and $J$ stand for the Peetre $K$- and $J$-functionals. In the case of the classical real interpolation method $(X_0,X_1)_{\theta,q}$, where $\theta \in (0,1)$ and $1\le q &lt; \infty$, this problem was solved by Lions and Peetre.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we completely describe the numerical range of Toeplitz operators on weighted Bergman spaces with harmonic symbol. We also characterize the numerical range of weighted composition operators on weighted Bergman spaces and classify some sets which are the numerical range of composition operators. We investigate the inclusion of zero in the numerical range, and compute the radius of circle and ellipse contained in the numerical range of weighted composition operators on weighted Bergman spaces.</description>

      <title>Operator ordering by ill-posedness in Hilbert and Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For operators representing ill-posed problems, an ordering by ill-posedness is proposed, where one operator is considered more ill-posed than another one if the former can be expressed as a cocatenation of bounded operators involving the latter. This definition is motivated by a recent one introduced by Math\'e and Hofmann [Adv. Oper. Theory, 2025] that utilizes bounded and orthogonal operators, and we show the equivalence of our new definition with this one for the case of compact and non-compact linear operators in Hilbert spaces. We compare our ordering with other measures of ill-posedness such as the decay of the singular values, norm estimates, and range inclusions. Furthermore, as the new definition does not depend on the notion of orthogonal operators, it can be extended to the case of linear operators in Banach spaces, and it also provides ideas for applications to nonlinear problems in Hilbert spaces. In the latter context, certain nonlinearity conditions can be interpreted as ordering relations between a nonlinear operator and its linearization.</description>

      <title>On Lebesgue points and measurability with Choquet integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Choquet integrals with respect to dyadic Hausdorff content of non-negative functions which are not necessarily Lebesgue measurable. We study the theory of Lebesgue points. The studies yield convergence results and also a density result between function spaces. We provide examples which show sharpness of the main convergence theorem. These examples give additional information about the convergence in the norm also, namely the difference of the functions in this setting and continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Hypercyclicity of Toeplitz operators with smooth symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the dynamics of Toeplitz operators $T_F$ with smooth symbols $F$ on the Hardy spaces of the unit disk $H^p$, $p&gt;1$. Building on a model theory for Toeplitz operators on $H^2$ developed by Yakubovich in the 90's, we carry out an in-depth study of hypercyclicity properties of such operators. Under some rather general smoothness assumptions on the symbol, we provide some necessary/sufficient/necessary and sufficient conditions for $T_F$ to be hypercyclic on $H^p$. In particular, we extend previous results on the subject by Baranov-Lishanskii and Abakumov-Baranov-Charpentier-Lishanskii. We also study some other dynamical properties for this class of operators.</description>

      <title>Dense Lineable Criterion for Linear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Li-Yorke chaos for sequences of continuous linear operators from an \(F\)-space to a normed space. We introduce the \emph{D-phenomenon} to establish a common dense lineable criterion that encompasses properties such as recurrence, universality, and Li-Yorke chaos. We show that in every infinite-dimensional separable complex Banach space, there exists a sequence of operators with a dense set of irregular vectors but without a dense irregular manifold, and we exhibit a recurrent operator whose set of recurrent vectors is not dense-lineable. This resolves in the negative a question posed by Grivaux et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we present applied mathematics results on the heat content of bounded domains with smooth boundary and with fractal boundary. Second, we discuss new findings and concepts related to fractal curvatures for domains with fractal boundary. We conjecture that fractal curvatures and their scaling exponents will emerge in the short-time heat content asymptotics of domains with fractal boundary.</description>

      <title>Elliptic operators with non-local Wentzell-Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study strictly elliptic, second-order differential operators on a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, subject to certain non-local Wentzell-Robin boundary conditions. We prove that such operators generate strongly continuous semigroups on $L^2$-spaces and on spaces of continuous functions. We also provide a characterisation of positivity and (sub-)Markovianity of these semigroups. Moreover, based on spectral analysis of these operators, we discuss further properties of the semigroup such as asymptotic behaviour and, in the case of a non-positive semigroup, the weaker notion of eventual positivity of the semigroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the extremality of nonexpansive mappings on a nonempty bounded closed and convex subset of a normed space (therein specific Banach spaces). We show that surjective isometries are extremal in this sense for many Banach spaces, including Banach spaces with the Radon-Nikodym property and all $C(K)$-spaces for compact Hausdorff $K$. We also conclude that the typical, in the sense of Baire category, nonexpansive mapping is close to being extremal.</description>

      <title>On a Santal\'o point for Nakamura-Tsuji's Laplace transform inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nakamura and Tsuji recently obtained an integral inequality involving a Laplace transform of even functions that implies, at the limit, the Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality in its functional form. Inspired by their method, based on the Fokker-Planck semi-group, we extend the inequality to non-even functions. We consider a well-chosen centering procedure by studying the infimum over translations in a double Laplace transform. This requires a new look on the existing methods and leads to several observations of independent interest on the geometry of the Laplace transform. Application to reverse hypercontractivity is also given.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the functional-analytic framework of operator-valued kernels and un-truncated signature kernels, we propose a scalable, provably convergent signature-based algorithm for a broad class of high-dimensional, path-dependent hedging problems. We make minimal assumptions about market dynamics by modelling them as general geometric rough paths, yielding a fully model-free approach. Furthermore, through a representer theorem, we provide theoretical guarantees on the existence and uniqueness of a global minimum for the resulting optimization problem and derive an analytic solution under highly general loss functions. Similar to the popular deep hedging approach, but in a more rigorous fashion, our method can also incorporate additional features via the underlying operator-valued kernel, such as trading signals, news analytics, and past hedging decisions, closely aligning with true machine-learning practice.</description>

      <title>Free dilations of families of $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commuting families of contractions or contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces often fail to admit power dilations resp. simultaneous unitary dilations which are themselves commutative (see [31, 11, 13]). There is however much room for non-commutative results. Sz.-Nagy [41] and Bo\.{z}ejko [4] provided means to dilate families of contractions to (in general non-commuting) families of unitaries. To complement this, the present work extends this discrete-time result to families $\{T_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ of contractive $\mathcal{C}_{0}$-semigroups. We refer to these dilations as continuous-time \emph{free unitary dilations} and present three distinct approaches to obtain them: 1) an explicit derivation applicable to semigroups that arise as interpolations; 2) a full proof with an explicit construction, which utilises the theory of co-generators \`{a} la S{\l}oci\'{n}ski [37, 38] and which generalises to the setting where the index set $I$ is topologised; and 3) a second full proof based on the abstract structure of semigroups, which admits a natural reformulation to semigroup defined over topological free products of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Finally we discuss residuality results and applications to evolution problems, drawing a connection to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1706.02678v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the post-critical set of a class of holomorphic systems with an irrationally indifferent fixed point. We prove a trichotomy for the topology of the post-critical set based on the arithmetic of the rotation number at the fixed point. The only options are Jordan curves, a one-sided hairy Jordan curves, and Cantor bouquet. This explains the degeneration of the closed invariant curves inside the Siegel disks, as one varies the rotation number.</description>
