      <title>Adiabatic state preparation for digital quantum simulations of QED in 1 + 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics in 1 + 1D (QED2) shares intriguing properties with QCD, including confinement, string breaking, and interesting phase diagram when the non-trivial topological $\theta$-term is considered. Its lattice regularization is a commonly used toy model for quantum simulations of gauge theories on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we address algorithms for adiabatic state preparation in digital quantum simulations of QED2. We demonstrate that, for specific choices of parameters, the existing adiabatic procedure leads to level crossing between states of different charge sectors, preventing the correct preparation of the ground state. We further propose a new adiabatic Hamiltonian and verify its efficiency in targeting systems with a nonzero topological $\theta$-term and in studying string breaking phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A characteristic signature of quark confinement is the concentration of the chromoelectric field between a static quark-antiquark pair in a flux tube. Here we report on lattice measurements of field distributions on smeared Monte Carlo ensembles in QCD with (2+1) HISQ flavors. We measure the field distributions for several distances between static quark-antiquark sources, ranging from 0.6 fm up to the distance where the color string is expected to break.</description>

      <title>Small-scale Hamiltonian optimization of interpolating operators for Lagrangian lattice quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice quantum field theory calculations may potentially combine the advantages of Hamiltonian formulations with the scalability and control of conventional Lagrangian frameworks. However, such hybrid approaches need to consider (1) the differences in renormalized coupling values between the two formulations, and (2) finite-volume and discretization effects when the Hamiltonian component of the calculation is characterized by a smaller volume or coarser lattice spacing than the Lagrangian component. This work investigates the role of both factors in the application of Hamiltonian-optimized interpolating operator constructions for the conventional Lagrangian framework. The numerical investigation is realized for the pseudoscalar meson in the Schwinger model, using tensor-network and Monte-Carlo calculations. It is demonstrated that tensor-network-optimized constructions are robust to both (1) and (2). In particular, accurate optimized constructions for the pseudoscalar meson can be obtained from calculations with a smaller number of Hamiltonian lattice sites, even when the meson mass itself receives significant finite-volume corrections. To the extent that these results generalize to theories with more complicated spectra, the method holds promise for near-term applications in large-scale calculations of lattice quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>IR and UV limits of CDT and their relations to FRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) is a lattice theory of quantum gravity. It is shown how to identify the IR and the UV limits of this lattice theory with similar limits studied using the continuum, functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. The main technical tool in this study will be the so-called two-point function. It will allow us to identify a correlation length not directly related to the propagation of physical degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Folding procedure for $\Omega$-$\alpha$ potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the folding procedure, we investigate the bound state of the $\Omega$+$\alpha$ system based on $\Omega$-$N$ ($^{5}S_{2}$) HAL QCD potential. Previous theoretical analyses have indicated the existence of a deeply bound ground state, which is attributed to the strong $\Omega$-nucleon interaction. By employing well-established parameterizations of nucleon density within the alpha particle, and the central HAL QCD $\Omega$-$N$ potential, we performed numerical calculations for the folding $\Omega$-$\alpha$ potential. Our results show that the $V_{\Omega\alpha}(r)$ potential can be accurately fitted using a Woods-Saxon function, with a phenomenological parameter $R = 1.1A^{1/3} \approx 1.74$ fm ($A=4$) in the asymptotic region where $2 &lt; r &lt; 3$ fm. We provide a thorough description of the corresponding numerical procedure. Our evaluation of the binding energy of the $\Omega$+$\alpha$ system within the cluster model is consistent with both previous and recent reported findings. To further validate the folding procedure, we also calculated the $\Xi$-$\alpha$ folding potential based on a simulation of the ESC08c $Y$-$N$ Nijmegen model. A comprehensive comparison between the $\Xi$-$\alpha$ folding and $\Xi$-$ \alpha$ phenomenological potentials is presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Short-flow-time expansion of quark bilinears through next-to-next-to-leading order QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gradient-flow formalism proves to be a useful tool in lattice calculations of quantum chromodynamics. For example, it can be used as a scheme to renormalize composite operators by inverting the short-flow-time expansion of the corresponding flowed operators. In this paper, we consider the short-flow-time expansion of five quark bilinear operators, the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axialvector, and tensor currents, and compute the matching coefficients through next-to-next-to-leading order QCD. Among other applications, our results constitute one ingredient for calculating bag parameters of mesons within the gradient-flow formalism on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Pion mass dependence in $D\pi$ scattering and the $D_0^*(2300)$ resonance from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice QCD results for isospin $I=\frac{1}{2}$ $D\pi$ scattering are presented. Utilizing a series of $N_{\text{f}}=2+1$ Wilson-Clover ensembles with pion masses of $m_\pi \approx 132, 208, 305$ and $317$ MeV, various two-particle operators are constructed and the corresponding finite-volume spectra are determined. The $S$ and $P$-wave scattering phase shifts are then extracted using the L\"{u}scher approach. A clear trend for the motion of the $D_0^*(2300)$ pole is identified. With the physical pion mass configurations also included, this calculation constitutes the first lattice calculation in which the pion mass dependence of the $D_0^*(2300)$ pole is investigated and the scattering lengths are extrapolated/interpolated to the physical pion mass in $D\pi$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Charm physics with overlap fermions on 2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons $D$, $D_s$, $\eta_c$ and vector mesons $D^*$, $D_s^*$, $J/\psi$ are determined from $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD at a lattice spacing $a\sim0.08$ fm. For vector mesons, the decay constants defined by tensor currents are given in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at $2$ GeV. The calculation is performed on domain wall fermion configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD Collaborations and the overlap fermion action is used for the valence quarks. Comparing the current results with our previous ones at a coarser lattice spacing $a\sim0.11$ fm gives us a better understanding of the discretization error. We obtain $f_{D_s^*}^T(\overline{\rm MS},\text{2 GeV})/f_{D_s^*}=0.907(20)$ with a better precision than our previous result. Combining our $f_{D_s^*}=277(11)$ MeV with the total width of $D_s^*$ determined in a recent work gives a branching fraction $4.26(52)\times10^{-5}$ for $D_s^*$ leptonic decay.</description>

      <title>A dualization approach to the Ground State Subspace Classification of Abelian Higher Gauge Symmetry Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the literature, abelian higher gauge symmetry models are shown to be valid in all finite dimensions and exhibit the characteristic behavior of SPT phases models. While the ground state degeneracy and the entanglement entropy were thoroughly studied, the classification of the ground state space still remained obscure. Based on differentio-geometric approach and, anticipating the notation of the current paper, if $\left( C_{\bullet} , \partial^C_{\bullet} \right)$ is the chain complex associated to the geometrical content of these models, while $\left( G_{\bullet} , \partial^G_{\bullet} \right)$ is its symmetries counterpart, we show that the ground state space is classified by a $H^0 (C,G) \times H_0 (C,G)$ group, where $H^0(C,G)$ is the $0$-th cohomology and $H_0 (C,G)$ is the corresponding $0$-th homology group with coefficients in the chain complex.</description>

      <title>Tetraquarks made of sufficiently unequal-mass heavy quarks are bound in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tetraquarks, bound states composed of two quarks and two antiquarks, have been the subject of intense study but are challenging to understand from first principles. We apply variational and Green's function Monte Carlo methods to compute tetraquark ground-state energies in potential nonrelativistic QCD using a wide range of color and spatial wavefunctions. We find no evidence for bound tetraquarks composed of equal-mass quarks and antiquarks. Conversely, we find clear evidence for the existence of bound tetraquarks for sufficiently unequal quark/antiquark mass ratios at all overall mass scales where our effective theory results are applicable. We predict the critical mass ratios for bound state formation and study tetraquark bound states' spatial and color structure at leading order and next-to-leading order in potential nonrelativistic QCD.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double-beta decay in a finite volume from relativistic effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutrinoless double-beta decay process $nn\rightarrow ppee$ within the light Majorana-exchange scenario is studied using the relativistic pionless effective field theory (EFT) in finite-volume cubic boxes with the periodic boundary conditions. Using the low-energy two-nucleon scattering observables from lattice QCD available at $m_\pi=300$, 450, 510, and 806 MeV, the leading-order $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements are predicted and their volume dependence is investigated. The predictions for the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements can be directly compared to the lattice QCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ process at the same pion masses. In particular for the matrix element at $m_\pi=806$ MeV, the predictions with relativistic pionless EFT are confronted to the recent first lattice QCD evaluation. Therefore, the present results are expected to play a crucial role in the benchmark between the nuclear EFTs and the upcoming lattice QCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow pp ee$ process, which would provide a nontrivial test on the predictive power of nuclear EFTs on neutrinoless double-beta decay.</description>

      <title>Approaching Stable Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of whether the ground state of baryon matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the ordinary nucleus or a quark matter state remains a long-standing question in physics. A critical parameter in this investigation is the bag parameter $B$, which quantifies the QCD vacuum energy and can be computed using nonperturbative methods such as Lattice QCD (LQCD). By combining the equation of state derived from perturbative QCD (pQCD) with the bag parameter to fit the LQCD-simulated data for isospin-dense matter, we address the stability of quark matter within the LQCD+pQCD framework. Our findings suggest that the current data imposes an upper bound on $B^{1/4} \lesssim 160~{\rm MeV}$, approaching a conclusive statement on quark matter stability. Given the lower bound on $B$ from the quark condensate contribution to the vacuum energy, the stable 2-flavor quark matter remains possible, whereas the stable 2+1-flavor quark matter is excluded. Additionally, we derive more general thermodynamic bounds on the quark matter energy-per-baryon and $B$, which, while weaker, provide complementary insights.</description>
