      <title>Hofmann-Streicher lifting of fibred categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1997, Hofmann and Streicher introduced an explicit construction to lift a Grothendieck universe $\mathcal{U}$ from $\mathbf{Set}$ into the category of $\mathbf{Set}$-valued presheaves on a $\mathcal{U}$-small category $B$. More recently, Awodey presented an elegant functorial analysis of this construction in terms of the categorical nerve, the right adjoint to the functor that takes a presheaf to its category of elements; in particular, the categorical nerve's functorial action on the universal $\mathcal{U}$-small discrete fibration gives the generic family of $\mathcal{U}$'s Hofmann-Streicher lifting. Inspired by Awodey's analysis, we define a relative version of Hofmann-Streicher lifting in terms of the right pseudo-adjoint to the 2-functor $\mathbf{Fib}_{A}\to\mathbf{Fib}_{B}$ given by postcomposition with a fibration $p\colon A\to B$.</description>

      <title>A three-functor formalism for commutative von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A three-functor formalism is the half of a six-functor formalism that supports the projection and base change formulas. In this paper, we provide a three-functor formalism for commutative von Neumann algebras and their modules. Using the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, this gives rise to a three-functor formalism for measure spaces and measurable bundles of Hilbert spaces. We use this to prove Fell absorption for unitary representations of measure groupoids.
  The three-functor formalism for commutative von Neumann algebras takes values in W*-categories, and we discuss in what sense it is a unitary three-functor formalism.</description>

      <title>Universal Algebra and Effectful Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract clones serve as an algebraic presentation of the syntax of a simple type theory. From the perspective of universal algebra, they define algebraic theories like those of groups, monoids and rings. This link allows one to study the language of simple type theory from the viewpoint of universal algebra.
  Programming languages, however, are much more complicated than simple type theory. Many useful features like reading, writing, and exception handling involve interacting with the environment; these are called side-effects. Algebraic presentations for languages with the appropriate syntax for handling effects are given by premulticategories and effectful multicategories. We study these structures with the aim of defining a suitable notion of an algebra.
  To achieve this goal, we proceed in two steps. First, we define a tensor on $[\to,\category{Set}]$, and show that this tensor along with the cartesian product gives the category a duoidal structure. Secondly, we introduce the novel notion of a multicategory enriched in a duoidal category which generalize the traditional notion of a multicategory. Further, we prove that an effectful multicategory is the same as a multicategory enriched in the duoidal category $[\to,\category{Set}]$. This result places multicategories and effectful multicategories on a similar footing, and provides a mechanism for transporting concepts from the theory of multicategories (which model pure computation) to the theory of effectful multicategories (which model effectful computation). As an example of this, we generalize the definition of a 2-morphism for multicategories to the duoidally enriched case. Our equivalence result then gives a natural definition of a 2-morphism for effectful multicategories, which we then use to define the notion of an algebra.</description>

      <title>The Physical Mathematics of Segal Topoi and Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of dynamics in the setting of Segal topos, by considering the Segal category of stacks $\mathcal{X} = \text{dAff}_{\mathcal{C}}^{\, \sim, \tau}$ on a Segal category $\text{dAff}_{\mathcal{C}}=$ L(Comm($\mathcal{C})^{op})$ as our system, and by regarding objects of $\mathbb{R}\underline{\text{Hom}}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{X})$ as its states. We develop the notion of quantum state in this setting and construct local and global flows of such states. In this formalism, strings are given by equivalences between elements of commutative monoids of $\mathcal{C}$, a base symmetric monoidal model category. The connection with standard string theory is made, and with M-theory in particular.</description>

      <title>How the convex space-metric space compatability conditions determine the Giry algebras on standard Borel spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the Giry monad on the category of measurable spaces restricts to the subcategory of standard Borel spaces, that the restricted $\mathcal{G}$-algebras are expectation maps, and give the necessary and sufficient conditions on a standard Borel space for $\mathcal{G}$-algebras to exist. Those conditions show the category of algebras is a proper subcategory of the category of standard Borel spaces which possess a superconvex space structure and satisfy two compatability conditions between the metric space structure and the superconvex space structure. In this category of algebras every affine measurable map is also countably affine.</description>

      <title>Modular operads, distributive laws and a nerve theorem for circuit algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circuit algebras are a symmetric version of Jones's planar algebras. They originated in quantum topology as a framework for encoding virtual crossings. Oriented circuit algebras are equivalent to wheeled props. This paper
  extends existing results for modular operads to construct a graphical calculus and monad for general circuit algebras and prove an abstract nerve theorem. Specialisations of these results to wheeled props follow as straightforward corollaries.
  The machinery used to prove these results relies on a subtle interplay between distributive laws and abstract nerve theory, and provides extra insights into the underlying structures.</description>

      <title>Automating Transfer of Robot Task Plans using Functorial Data Migrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to ontology-based robot plan transfer by leveraging functorial data migrations, a structured mapping method derived from category theory. Functors provide structured maps between planning domain ontologies which enables the transfer of task plans without the need for replanning. Unlike methods tailored to specific plans, our framework applies universally within the source domain once a structured map is defined. We demonstrate this approach by transferring a task plan from the canonical Blocksworld domain to one compatible with the AI2-THOR Kitchen environment. Additionally, we discuss practical limitations, propose benchmarks for evaluating symbolic plan transfer methods, and outline future directions for scaling this approach.</description>

      <title>Comodule Representations of Second-Order Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and investigate a general theory of representations of second-order functionals, based on a notion of a right comodule for a monad on the category of containers. We show how the notion of comodule representability naturally subsumes classic representations of continuous functionals with well-founded trees. We find other kinds of representations by varying the monad, the comodule, and in some cases the underlying category of containers. Examples include uniformly continuous or finitely supported functionals, functionals querying their arguments precisely once, or at most once, functionals interacting with an ambient environment through computational effects, as well as functionals trivially representing themselves. Many of these rely on our construction of a monad on containers from a monad on shapes and a weak Mendler-style monad algebra on the universe for positions. We show that comodule representability on the category of propositional containers, which have positions valued in a universe of propositions, is closely related to instance reducibility in constructive mathematics, and through it to Weihrauch reducibility in computability theory.</description>

      <title>What is Connectivity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a taxonomy of connectivity for space-like structures. It is inspired by isolating posets of connected pieces of a space and examining its embedding in the ambient space. The taxonomy includes in its scope all standard notions of connectivity in point-set and point-free contexts, such as connectivity in graphs and hypergraphs (as well as k-connectivity in graphs), connectivity and path-connectivity in topology, and connectivity of elements in a frame.</description>
