      <title>On Rational Recursion for Holonomic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently conjectured that every component of a discrete rational dynamical system is a solution to an algebraic difference equation that is linear in its highest-shift term (a quasi-linear equation). Holonomic sequences are trivially seen as solutions to such dynamical systems. We prove that the conjecture holds for holonomic sequences and propose two algorithms for converting holonomic recurrence equations into such quasi-linear equations. The two algorithms differ in their efficiency and the minimality of orders in their outputs.</description>

      <title>Flattability of Priority Vector Addition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector addition systems (VAS), also known as Petri nets, are a popular model of concurrent systems. Many problems from many areas reduce to the reachability problem for VAS, which consists of deciding whether a target configuration of a VAS is reachable from a given initial configuration. One of the main approaches to solve the problem on practical instances is called flattening, intuitively removing nested loops. This technique is known to terminate for semilinear VAS. In this paper, we prove that also for VAS with nested zero tests, called Priority VAS, flattening does in fact terminate for all semilinear reachability relations. Furthermore, we prove that Priority VAS admit semilinear inductive invariants. Both of these results are obtained by defining a well-quasi-order on runs of Priority VAS which has good pumping properties.</description>

      <title>Subsets of groups with context-free preimages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study subsets $E$ of finitely generated groups where the set of all words over a given finite generating set that lie in $E$ forms a context-free language. We call these sets recognisably context-free. They are invariant of the choice of generating set and a theorem of Muller and Schupp fully classifies when the set $\{1\}$ can be recognisably context-free. We extend Muller and Schupp's result to show that a group $G$ admits a finite recognisably context-free subset if and only if $G$ is virtually free. We show that every conjugacy class of a group $G$ is recognisably context-free if and only if $G$ is virtually free. We conclude by showing that a coset is recognisably context-free if and only if the Schreier coset graph of the corresponding subgroup is quasi-isometric to a tree.</description>

      <title>Behavioural pseudometrics for continuous-time diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bisimulation is a concept that captures behavioural equivalence of states in a variety of types of transition systems. It has been widely studied in a discrete-time setting where the notion of a step is fundamental. In our setting we are considering "flow"-processes emphasizing that they evolve in continuous time. In such continuous-time settings, the concepts are not straightforward adaptations of their discrete-time analogues and we restrict our study to diffusions that do not lose mass over time and with additional regularity constraints.
  In previous work we proposed different definitions of behavioural equivalences for continuous-time stochastic processes where the evolution is a flow through time. That work only addressed equivalences. In this work, we aim at quantifying how differently processes behave. We present two pseudometrics for diffusion-like processes. These pseudometrics are fixpoints of two different functionals on the space of 1-bounded pseudometrics on the state space. We also characterize these pseudometrics in terms of real-valued modal logics; this is a quantitative analogue of the notion of logical characterization of bisimulation. These real-valued modal logics indicate that the two pseudometrics are different and thus yield different notions of behavioural equivalence.</description>
