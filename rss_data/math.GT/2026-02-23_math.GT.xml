      <title>4-dimensional Skein modules, Handle attachments, and Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skein lasagna modules are a recent tool developed for the study of 4-manifolds. We provide general formula for 1-, 2-, and 3-handle attachments for skein modules defined with any functorial link theory in $S^3 \times I$ generalizing existing formula of Chen, Manolescu-Neithalath, Manolescu-Walker-Wedrich, and Ren-Willis. These formula are derived from a complete description of the gluing homomorphism on skein modules. For this description, we introduce a variation of these skein modules in the presence of distinguished 3-manifolds in the boundary. A similar construction was recently introduced independently by Blackwell-Krushkal-Luo.</description>

      <title>Positive braid closures and taut foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study taut foliations on the complements of non-split positive braid closures in $S^3$. If $L$ is such a link with components $L_1,\ldots,L_n$ and at least one component is not the unknot, then the Dehn surgery along a multislope $(s_1,\ldots,s_n)\in\mathbb{Q}^n$ satisfying $s_i&lt;2g(L_i)-1$ for $i=1,2,\ldots, n$ yields a non-L-space that admits a co-oriented taut foliation.</description>

      <title>Stuck Knots: Rigidity, Invariants, and Unsticking Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\it stuck knot} is a knot diagram containing designated crossings, called {\it stuck crossings}, whose incident strands are required to remain locally non-separable. These rigidity constraints restrict the allowable ambient isotopies and introduce new geometric features into the study of knot embeddings. In this paper we develop a topological framework for knots governed by such constraints. We model stuck crossings as locally rigid configurations in spatial embeddings, placing stuck knots in close relation to rigid spatial graph theory while preserving the classical over-under information and orientation of crossings. We formalize the corresponding notion of isotopy and introduce the {\it unstick move}, which releases rigidity and allows classical simplifications to occur. To detect rigid structure algebraically, we construct polynomial invariants for stuck knots, including a HOMFLYPT-type invariant and a state-sum model extending the Kauffman bracket. These invariants show that rigidity contributes independent information even when the underlying classical knot type remains fixed. We further introduce a {\it relaxed isotopy} framework and define the {\it unsticking distance}, a geometric measure quantifying the minimal number of rigidity constraints that must be released in order to relate two stuck knots. This perspective interprets stuck crossings as barriers to isotopy and highlights the role of constraint release in diagrammatic simplification.</description>

      <title>Bestvina metric and tree reduction for $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reduce the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for all Artin groups to properties of Artin groups whose Coxeter diagrams are trees, from which we deduce new classes of Artin groups satisfying the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture. This relies on constructing actions of Artin groups on Bestvina complexes of suitable Garside groupoids.</description>

      <title>From Trees to Tripods: Proof of $K(\pi,1)$ for Artin groups with $ABI$-type spherical parabolics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reduce the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for all Artin groups with tree Coxeter diagrams to properties of Artin groups with tripod-shaped Coxeter diagrams. Combining this reduction theorem and properties of braid groups in previous works of Charney, Crisp-McCammond, Haettel and the second named author, we deduce that the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for every Artin group whose spherical parabolic subgroups avoid type $D_n$ ($n \ge 4$) and the exceptional types.
  The reduction theorem relies on producing a ``tower'' of injective metric spaces from a single Artin group. The construction of such a tower relies on two ingredients of independent interests: a notion of combinatorial convexity and a Bestvina-type inequality, in certain injective orthoscheme complexes. These ingredients further rely on the use of structural properties of bi-Helly graphs (also known as absolute bipartite retracts) developed in joint work of the first named author with Munro.</description>

      <title>Invariant sets for homeomorphisms of hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that under some assumptions on how points escape to infinity in the universal cover, homeomorphisms of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are forced to have several invariant sets (in particular, they cannot be minimal). For this, we use some shadowing techniques which, when the homeomorphism has positive speed with respect to a uniform foliation, allow us to obtain strong consequences on the structure of the invariant sets. We discuss also homological rotation sets and end the paper with some extensions to other manifolds as well as posing some general problems for the understanding of minimal homeomorphisms of 3-manifolds.</description>
