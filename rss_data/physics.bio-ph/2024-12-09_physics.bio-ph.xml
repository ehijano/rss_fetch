      <title>Polymyxin B-Enriched Exogenous Lung Surfactant: Thermodynamics and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of exogenous pulmonary surfactant (EPS) to deliver other relevant drugs to the lung is a promising strategy for combined therapy. We evaluated the interaction of polymyxin B (PxB) with clinically used EPS, the poractant alfa Curosurf (PSUR). The effect of PxB on the protein-free model system (MS) composed of four phospholipids (diC16:0PC/16:0-18:1PC/16:0-18:2PC/16:0-18:1PG) was examined in parallel to distinguish the specificity of the composition of PSUR. We used several experimental techniques (differential scanning calorimetry, small-and wide-angle X-ray scattering, small angle neutron scattering, fluorescence spectroscopy, and electrophoretic light scattering) to characterize the binding of PxB to both EPS. Electrostatic interactions PxB -EPS are dominant. The results obtained support the concept of cationic PxB molecules lying on the surface of the PSUR bilayer, strengthening the multilamellar structure of the PSUR as derived from SAXS and SANS. A protein-free MS mimics natural EPS well but was found to be less resistant to penetration of PxB into the lipid bilayer. PxB does not affect the gel-to-fluid phase transition temperature Tm of PSUR, while Tm increased by ~ +2 $^\circ$C in MS. The decrease of the thickness of the lipid bilayer (dL) of PSUR upon PxB binding is negligible. The hydrophobic tail of the PxB molecule does not penetrate the bilayer as derived from SANS data analysis and changes in lateral pressure monitored by excimer fluorescence at two depths of the hydrophobic region of the bilayer. Changes in dL of protein-free MS show a biphasic dependence on the adsorbed amount of PxB with a minimum close to the point of electroneutrality of the mixture. Our results do not discourage the concept of a combined treatment with PxBenriched Curosurf. However, the amount of PxB must be carefully assessed (less than 5 wt% relative to the mass of the surfactant) to avoid inversion of the surface charge of the membrane.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal distribution of the glycoprotein pherophorin II reveals stochastic geometry of the growing ECM of $Volvox~carteri$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of multicellularity involved the transformation of a simple cell wall of unicellular ancestors into a complex, multifunctional extracellular matrix (ECM). A suitable model organism to study the formation and expansion of an ECM during ontogenesis is the multicellular green alga $Volvox~carteri$, which, along with the related volvocine algae, produces a complex, self-organized ECM composed of multiple substructures. These self-assembled ECMs primarily consist of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, a major component of which is pherophorins. To investigate the geometry of the growing ECM, we fused the $yfp$ gene with the gene for pherophorin II (PhII) in $V.~carteri$. Confocal microscopy reveals PhII:YFP localization at key structures within the ECM, including the boundaries of compartments surrounding each somatic cell and the outer surface of the organism. Image analysis during the life cycle allows the stochastic geometry of those growing compartments to be quantified. We find that their areas and aspect ratios exhibit robust gamma distributions and exhibit a transition from a tight polygonal to a looser acircular packing geometry with stable eccentricity over time, evoking parallels and distinctions with the behavior of hydrated foams. These results provide a quantitative benchmark for addressing a general, open question in biology: How do cells produce structures external to themselves in a robust and accurate manner?</description>

      <title>Confinement determines transport of a reaction-diffusion active matter front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Couplings between biochemical and mechanical processes have a profound impact on embryonic development. However, in-vitro studies capable of quantifying these interactions have remained elusive. Here, we investigate a synthetic system where a DNA reaction-diffusion (RD) front is advected by a turbulent flow generated by active matter (AM) flows in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Whereas the dynamics of simple RD fronts solely depend on the reaction and diffusion rates, we show that RD-AM front propagation is also influenced by the confinement geometry. We first experimentally dissected the different components of the reaction-diffusion-advection process by knocking out reaction or advection and observed how RD-AM allows for faster transport over large distances, avoiding dilution. We then show how confinement impacts active matter flow: while changes in instantaneous flow velocities are small; correlation times are dramatically increased with decreasing confinement. As a result, RD-AM front speed increased up to 8-fold compared to a RD one, in quantitative agreement with a conveyor belt RDA theoretical model. The RD-AM experimental system described here provides a framework for the rational engineering of complex spatiotemporal processes observed in living systems. It will reinforce our understanding of how macro-scale patterns and structures emerge from microscopic components in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of skull properties on long-pulsed transcranial focused ultrasound transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the brain in a minimally invasive manner for neuromodulation applications. However, long-pulsed sonication through the skull introduces significant wave interactions, complicating precise energy delivery to the target. We present a comprehensive examination of intracranial acoustic fields generated by focused ultrasound transducers and assess the characteristics of cranial bone that affect acoustic transmission. Acoustic field maps were generated at 88 regions of interest across 10 historical and 2 Thiel-embalmed human skull specimens with sonication at frequencies of 220 kHz, 650 kHz, and 1000 kHz. The average peak pressure insertion loss was 3.1$\pm$1.4 dB, 9.0$\pm$1.7 dB, and 14.6$\pm$4.1 dB, and the average power insertion loss was 5.0$\pm$2.4 dB, 14.9$\pm$3.2 dB, and 24.1$\pm$6.3 dB, respectively. The effect of skull thickness, skull density ratio, and skull curvature on intracranial peak pressure and power was investigated and linear fits produced. Our results demonstrate that Thiel-embalmed samples fall within the confidence intervals of fits for historical samples. The effects of angulation and spacing between the transducer and the skull were also investigated. Results indicate that wave superposition resulting from skull and transducer spacing could lead to a 30-40% uncertainty in peak recorded intracranial pressure.</description>
