      <title>Benjamini-Schramm limits of high genus translation surfaces: research announcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the sequence of Masur-Smillie-Veech (MSV) distributed random translation surfaces, with area equal to genus, Benjamini-Schramm converges as genus tends to infinity. This means that for any fixed radius $r&gt;0$, if $X_g$ is an MSV-distributed random translation surface with area $g$ and genus $g$, and $o$ is a uniformly random point in $X_g$, then the radius-$r$ neighborhood of $o$ in $X_g$, as a pointed measured metric space, converges in distribution to the radius $r$ neighborhood of the root in a Poisson translation plane, which is a random pointed surface we introduce here. Along the way, we obtain bounds on statistical local geometric properties of translation surfaces, such as the probability that the random point $o$ has injectivity radius at most $r$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Grid homology for singular links in lens space and a resolution cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define grid homology for singular links in lens spaces and use it to construct a resolution cube for knot Floer homology of regular links in lens spaces. The results will first be proven over $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and then extended to be over $\mathbb{Z}$ via a sign assignment.</description>

      <title>Exotic elliptic surfaces without 1-handles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a sufficient condition that a knot surgery or log-transformation of $E(n)$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles. We show that if $K$ is a knot that the bridge number is $b(K)\le 9n$, then the knot surgery $E(n)_K$ of an elliptic surface $E(n)$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles. Furthermore, we also show that the double log-transformation $E(n)_{2,q}$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles for any positive integer $n$ and any odd integer $q$.</description>

      <title>Realising VCD for untwisted automorphism groups of RAAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The virtual cohomological dimension of $\operatorname{Out}(F_n)$ is given precisely by the dimension of the spine of Culler--Vogtmann Outer space. However, the dimension of the spine of untwisted Outer space for a general right-angled Artin group $A_\Gamma$ does not necessarily match the virtual cohomological dimension of the untwisted subgroup $U(A_\Gamma) \leq \operatorname{Out}(A_\Gamma)$. Under certain graph-theoretic conditions, we perform an equivariant deformation retraction of this spine to produce a new contractible cube complex upon which $U(A_\Gamma)$ acts properly and cocompactly. Furthermore, we give conditions for when the dimension of this complex realises the virtual cohomological dimension of $U(A_\Gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Twist positivity, L-space knots, and concordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many well studied knots can be realized as positive braid knots where the braid word contains a positive full twist; we say that such knots are twist positive. Some important families of knots are twist positive, including torus knots, 1-bridge braids, algebraic knots, and Lorenz knots. We prove that if a knot is twist positive, the braid index appears as the third exponent in its Alexander polynomial. We provide a few applications of this result. After observing that most known examples of L-space knots are twist positive, we prove: if $K$ is a twist positive L-space knot, the braid index and bridge index of $K$ agree. This allows us to provide evidence for Baker's reinterpretation of the slice-ribbon conjecture: that every smooth concordance class contains at most one fibered, strongly quasipositive knot. In particular, we provide the first example of an infinite family of positive braid knots which are distinct in concordance, and where, as $g \to \infty$, the number of hyperbolic knots of genus g gets arbitrarily large. Finally, we collect some evidence for a few new conjectures, including the following: the braid and bridge indices agree for any L-space knot.</description>

      <title>Intersection of transverse foliations in 3-manifolds: Hausdorff leafspace implies leafwise quasi-geodesic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ be transverse two dimensional foliations with Gromov hyperbolic leaves in a closed 3-manifold $M$ whose fundamental group is not solvable, and let $\mathcal{G}$ be the one dimensional foliation obtained by intersection. We show that $\mathcal{G}$ is \emph{leafwise quasigeodesic} in $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ if and only if the foliation $\mathcal{G}_L$ induced by $\mathcal{G}$ in the universal cover $L$ of any leaf of $\mathcal{F}_1$ or $\mathcal{F}_2$ has Hausdorff leaf space. We end up with a discussion on the hypothesis of Gromov hyperbolicity of the leaves.</description>

      <title>Uniform degeneration of hyperbolic surfaces with boundary along harmonic map rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the degeneration of hyperbolic surfaces along a ray given by the harmonic map parametrization of Teichm\"uller space. The direction of the ray is determined by a holomorphic quadratic differential on a punctured Riemann surface, which has poles of order $\geq 2$ at each puncture. We show that the rescaled distance functions of the universal covers of hyperbolic surfaces uniformly converge, on a certain non-compact region containing a fundamental domain, to the intersection number with the vertical measured foliation given by the holomorphic quadratic differential determining the direction of the ray. This implies that hyperbolic surfaces along the ray converge to the dual $\mathbb{R}$-tree of the vertical measured foliation in the sense of Gromov-Hausdorff. As an application, we determine the limit of the hyperbolic surfaces in the Thurston boundary.</description>

      <title>Profinite almost rigidity in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any compact, orientable 3-manifold with empty or toral boundary is profinitely almost rigid among all compact, orientable 3-manifolds. In other words, the profinite completion of its fundamental group determines its homeomorphism type to finitely many possibilities. Moreover, the profinite completion of the fundamental group of a mixed 3-manifold, together with the peripheral structure, uniquely determines the homeomorphism type of its Seifert part, i.e. the maximal graph manifold components in the JSJ-decomposition. On the other hand, without assigning the peripheral structure, the profinite completion of a mixed 3-manifold group may not uniquely determine the fundamental group of its Seifert part. The proof is based on JSJ-decomposition.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact oriented 3-manifold with non-empty boundary consisting of surfaces of genii $&gt;1$ such that the interior of $M$ is hyperbolizable. We show that for each spherical cone-metric $d$ on $\partial M$ such that all cone-angles are greater than $2\pi$ and the lengths of all closed geodesics that are contractible in $M$ are greater than $2\pi$ there exists a unique strictly polyhedral hyperbolic metric on $M$ such that $d$ is the induced dual metric on $\partial M$.</description>

      <title>Vanishing cycles of symplectic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several results in recent years have shown that the usual generalizations of taut foliations to higher dimensions, based only on topological concepts, lead to a theory that lacks the complexity of its 3-dimensional counterpart. Instead, we propose strong symplectic foliations as natural candidates for such a generalization and we prove in this article that they do yield some interesting rigidity results, such as potentially topological obstructions on the underlying ambient manifold. We introduce a high-dimensional generalization of 3-dimensional vanishing cycles for symplectic foliations, which we call Lagrangian vanishing cycles, and prove that they prevent a symplectic foliation from being strong, just as vanishing cycles prevent tautness in dimension 3 due to the classical result of Novikov from 1964. We then describe, in every codimension, examples of symplectically foliated manifolds which admit Lagrangian vanishing cycles, but for which more classical arguments fail to obstruct strongness. In codimension 1, this is achieved by a rather explicit modification of the symplectic foliation, which allows us to open up closed leaves having non-trivial holonomy on both sides, and is thus of independent interest. Since there is no comprehensive source on holomorphic curves with boundary in symplectic foliations, we also give a detailed introduction to much of the analytic theory, in the hope that it might serve as a reference for future work in this direction.</description>
