      <title>Opportunity-Cost-Driven Reward Mechanisms for Crowd-Sourced Computing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a game-theoretic model tailored for reward distribution on crowd-sourced computing platforms. It explores a repeated game framework where miners, as computation providers, decide their computation power contribution in each round, guided by the platform's designed reward distribution mechanism. The reward for each miner in every round is based on the platform's randomized task payments and the miners' computation transcripts. Specifically, it defines Opportunity-Cost-Driven Incentive Compatibility (OCD-IC) and Dynamic OCD-IC (DOCD-IC) for scenarios where strategic miners might allocate some computation power to more profitable activities, such as Bitcoin mining. The platform must also achieve Budget Balance (BB), aiming for a non-negative total income over the long term. This paper demonstrates that traditional Pay-Per-Share (PPS) reward schemes require assumptions about task demand and miners' opportunity costs to ensure OCD-IC and BB, yet they fail to satisfy DOCD-IC. The paper then introduces Pay-Per-Share with Subsidy (PPSS), a new reward mechanism that allows the platform to provide subsidies to miners, thus eliminating the need for assumptions on opportunity cost to achieve OCD-IC, DOCD-IC, and long-term BB.</description>

      <title>The Feedback Loop Between Recommendation Systems and Reactive Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems underlie a variety of online platforms. These recommendation systems and their users form a feedback loop, wherein the former aims to maximize user engagement through personalization and the promotion of popular content, while the recommendations shape users' opinions or behaviors, potentially influencing future recommendations. These dynamics have been shown to lead to shifts in users' opinions. In this paper, we ask whether reactive users, who are cognizant of the influence of the content they consume, can prevent such changes by actively choosing whether to engage with recommended content. We first model the feedback loop between reactive users' opinion dynamics and a recommendation system. We study these dynamics under three different policies - fixed content consumption (a passive policy), and decreasing or adaptive decreasing content consumption (reactive policies). We analytically show how reactive policies can help users effectively prevent or restrict undesirable opinion shifts, while still deriving utility from consuming content on the platform. We validate and illustrate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-organisation of common good usage and an application to Internet services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural and human-made common goods present key challenges due to their susceptibility to degradation, overuse, or congestion. We explore the self-organisation of their usage when individuals have access to several available commons but limited information on them. We propose an extension of the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS) strategy for such systems, under which individuals use a resource iteratively until they are unsuccessful and then shift randomly. This simple strategy leads to a distribution of the use of commons with an improvement against random shifting. Selective individuals who retain information on their usage and accordingly adapt their tolerance to failure in each common good improve the average experienced quality for an entire population. Hybrid systems of selective and non-selective individuals can lead to an equilibrium with equalised experienced quality akin to the ideal free distribution. We show that these results can be applied to the server selection problem faced by mobile users accessing Internet services and we perform realistic simulations to test their validity. Furthermore, these findings can be used to understand other real systems such as animal dispersal on grazing and foraging land, and to propose solutions to operators of systems of public transport or other technological commons.</description>

      <title>Bandit Social Learning: Exploration under Myopic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07425v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study social learning dynamics motivated by reviews on online platforms. The agents collectively follow a simple multi-armed bandit protocol, but each agent acts myopically, without regards to exploration. We allow the greedy (exploitation-only) algorithm, as well as a wide range of behavioral biases. Specifically, we allow myopic behaviors that are consistent with (parameterized) confidence intervals for the arms' expected rewards. We derive stark learning failures for any such behavior, and provide matching positive results. The learning-failure results extend to Bayesian agents and Bayesian bandit environments.
  In particular, we obtain general, quantitatively strong results on failure of the greedy bandit algorithm, both for ``frequentist" and ``Bayesian" versions. Failure results known previously are quantitatively weak, and either trivial or very specialized. Thus, we provide a theoretical foundation for designing non-trivial bandit algorithms, \ie algorithms that intentionally explore, which has been missing from the literature.
  Our general behavioral model can be interpreted as agents' optimism or pessimism. The matching positive results entail a maximal allowed amount of optimism. Moreover, we find that no amount of pessimism helps against the learning failures, whereas even a small-but-constant fraction of extreme optimists avoids the failures and leads to near-optimal regret rates.</description>

      <title>Effective Two-Stage Double Auction for Dynamic Resource Provision over Edge Networks via Discovering The Power of Overbooking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To facilitate responsive and cost-effective computing resource scheduling and service delivery over edge-assisted mobile networks, this paper investigates a novel two-stage double auction methodology via utilizing an interesting idea of resource overbooking to overcome dynamic and uncertain nature from edge servers (sellers) and demand from mobile devices (as buyers). The proposed auction integrates multiple essential factors such as social welfare maximization and decision-making latency (e.g., the time for determining winning seller-buyer pairs) reduction, by introducing a stagewise strategy: an overbooking-driven pre-double auction (OPDAuction) for determining long-term cooperations between sellers and buyers before practical resource transactions as Stage I, and a real-time backup double auction (RBDAuction) for handling residual resource demands during actual transactions. In particular, by applying a proper overbooking rate, OPDAuction helps with facilitating trading contracts between appropriate sellers and buyers as guidance for future transactions, by allowing the booked resources to exceed supply. Then, since pre-auctions may cause risks, our RBDAuction adjusts to real-time market changes, further enhancing the overall social welfare. More importantly, we offer an interesting view to show that our proposed two-stage auction can support significant design properties such as truthfulness, individual rationality, and budget balance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate good performance in social welfare, time efficiency, and computational scalability, outstripping conventional methods in dynamic edge computing settings.</description>
