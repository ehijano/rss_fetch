      <title>Non-factorizable ribbon Hopf Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the work of Nenciu we provide examples of non-factorizable ribbon Hopf algebras, and introduce a stronger notion of non-factorizability. These algebras are designed to provide invariants of $4$-dimensional $2$-handlebodies up to 2-deformations. We prove that some of the invariants derived from these examples are invariants dependent only on the boundary or on the presentation of the fundamental group of the 2-handlebody.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00105v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</description>

      <title>The Mathematics of Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I report the existence of exactly one non-trivial solution to the equation $i(A,B)+i(A,\neg B)+i(\neg A,B)+i(\neg A,\neg B)= 0$, where $i(A,B)=\log\frac{P(A\text{ and }B)}{P(A)P(B)}$, and $P(A)$ is the probability of the proposition $A$. The equation specifies an information balance condition between two logical propositions, which is satisfied only by independence and by this new solution. The solution is a new elementary informational relationship between logical propositions, which we denote as $A \sim B$.
  The $\sim$ relation cannot be expressed as a relationship between probabilities without the use of complex numbers. It can, however, be greatly simplified by expressing each proposition as a combination of a question and an answer, for example, writing, ``All men are mortal'', as (Are all men mortal?, Yes).
  We will study the mathematics of questions and find out what role the $\sim$ relationship plays inside the algebra. We will find that, like propositions, questions can act on probability distributions. A proposition, $X$, can be given, setting $P(X)$ to 1. The question of $X$ can be raised, setting $P(X)$ to $1/2$. Giving the proposition adds information to the probability distribution, but raising the question takes information away. Introducing questions into probability theory makes it possible to represent subtraction of information as well as addition.
  We will examine how questions can be related to each other geometrically. Remarkably, the simplest way of orienting questions in space has the same structure as the simplest quantum system -- the two-state system. We will find that the essential mathematical structure of the two-state quantum system can be derived from the mathematics of questions, including non-commutativity, complementarity, wavefunction collapse, the Hilbert space representation and the Born rule, as well as quantum entanglement and non-locality.</description>

      <title>Inverse Hamiltonian reduction in type A and generalized slices in the affine Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric proof of inverse Hamiltonian reduction for all finite W-algebras in type $A$, a certain embedding of the finite W-algebra corresponding to an arbitrary nilpotent in $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ into that corresponding to a larger nilpotent with respect to the closure order on orbits, tensored with an auxiliary algebra of differential operators. We first prove a classical analogue for equivariant Slodowy slices using multiplication maps on generalized slices in the affine Grassmannian, then deduce the result for equivariant finite W-algebras by Fedosov quantization. This implies the statement for finite W-algebras, as well as Kostant-Whittaker reductions of arbitrary algebras in the category of Harish Chandra bimodules, including quantizations of Moore--Tachikawa varieties.</description>

      <title>Jet Functors in Noncommutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we construct three infinite families of endofunctors $J_d^{(n)}$, $J_d^{[n]}$, and $J_d^n$ on the category of left $A$-modules, where $A$ is a unital associative algebra over a commutative ring $\mathbb{k}$, equipped with an exterior algebra $\Omega^\bullet_d$. We prove that these functors generalize the corresponding classical notions of nonholonomic, semiholonomic, and holonomic jet functors, respectively. Our functors come equipped with natural transformations from the identity functor to the corresponding jet functors, which play the r\^{o}les of the classical prolongation maps. This allows us to define the notion of linear differential operators with respect to $\Omega^{\bullet}_d$. We show that if $\Omega^1_d$ is flat as a right $A$-module, the semiholonomic jet functor satisfies the semiholonomic jet exact sequence $0 \rightarrow \bigotimes^n_A \Omega^1_d \rightarrow J^{[n]}_d\rightarrow J^{[n-1]}_d \rightarrow 0$. Moreover, we construct a functor of symmetric (in a suitable noncommutative sense) forms $S^n_d$ associated to $\Omega^\bullet_d$, and proceed to introduce the corresponding noncommutative analogue of the Spencer $\delta$-complex. We give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the holonomic jet functor $J_d^n$ satisfies the (holonomic) jet exact sequence, $0\rightarrow S^n_d \rightarrow J_d^n \rightarrow J_d^{n-1} \rightarrow 0$. In particular, for $n=1$ the sequence is always exact, for $n=2$ it is exact for $\Omega^1_d$ flat as a right $A$-module, and for $n\ge 3$, it is sufficient to have $\Omega^1_d$, $\Omega^2_d$, and $\Omega^3_d$ flat as right $A$-modules and the vanishing of the Spencer $\delta$-cohomology $H^{\bullet,2}_{\delta_d}$.</description>

      <title>The non-semisimple Kazhdan-Lusztig category for affine $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at admissible levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Kazhdan and Lusztig's category $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of modules for the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2$ at an admissible level $k$, equivalently the category of finite-length grading-restricted generalized modules for the universal affine vertex operator algebra $V^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, is a braided tensor category. Although this tensor category is not rigid, we show that the subcategory of all rigid objects in $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is equal to the subcategory of all projective objects, and that every simple module in $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ has a projective cover. Moreover, we show that the full subcategory of projective objects in $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is monoidal equivalent to the category of tilting modules for quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at the root of unity $\zeta=e^{\pi i/(k+2)}$. Using this, we establish a universal property of the tensor category $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, and as an application, we prove a weak Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence, that is, we obtain an exact essentially surjective (but not full or faithful) tensor functor from $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ to the category of finite dimensional weight modules for the quantum group associated to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at the root of unity $\zeta $. We also use the universal property to classify the categories $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ up to (braided) tensor equivalence and to obtain a tensor-categorical version of quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction, that is, we construct a braided tensor functor from $KL^k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ to a category of modules for the Virasoro algebra at central charge $1-\frac{6(k+1)^2}{k+2}$.</description>
