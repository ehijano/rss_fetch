      <title>XDXD: End-to-end crystal structure determination with low resolution X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining crystal structures from X-ray diffraction data is fundamental across diverse scientific fields, yet remains a significant challenge when data is limited to low resolution. While recent deep learning models have made breakthroughs in solving the crystallographic phase problem, the resulting low-resolution electron density maps are often ambiguous and difficult to interpret. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we introduce XDXD, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end deep learning framework to determine a complete atomic model directly from low-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Our diffusion-based generative model bypasses the need for manual map interpretation, producing chemically plausible crystal structures conditioned on the diffraction pattern. We demonstrate that XDXD achieves a 70.4\% match rate for structures with data limited to 2.0~\AA{} resolution, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 0.05. Evaluated on a benchmark of 24,000 experimental structures, our model proves to be robust and accurate. Furthermore, a case study on small peptides highlights the model's potential for extension to more complex systems, paving the way for automated structure solution in previously intractable cases.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Generation of Special Quasirandom Structures with ATAT Using Interactive Online Interface - SimplySQS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is a widely used approach for modeling random alloys with periodic boundary conditions. Among available implementations, the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) mcsqs module remains one of the most established tools for SQS generation. However, its command-line operation and input file preparation often present a steep learning curve, particularly for students and researchers without programming experience. To lower these barriers, we have developed SimplySQS (simplysqs.com), an online, browser-based interactive interface that automates the preparation, execution, and analysis of ATAT mcsqs outputs. SimplySQS allows users to upload or import structures from databases (MP, AFLOW, COD), configure compositions and supercells via guided forms, automatically generate ATAT input and batch scripts, and visualize results such as convergence behavior, correlation functions, and radial distribution functions. The best SQS outputs can be exported in standard formats (POSCAR, CIF, LMP, XYZ). By simplifying setup and minimizing file-handling errors, SimplySQS broadens access to ATAT mcsqs, making SQS generation more approachable for beginners while streamlining workflows for experienced users. The workflow is illustrated on the perovskite series Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3 (STO)), where an all-in-one batch script generated with SimplySQS was used to obtain SQSs across the composition range. The resulting structures were subsequently optimized using the MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0 universal machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to predict evolution of lattice parameters. The MLIP accurately reproduced the cubic-to-tetragonal transition near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic (x &gt; 0.5) and 3 % in the tetragonal (x &lt; 0.5) regions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking 34 OpenKIM Nickel Potentials with an Emphasis on Surfaces and Extended Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automated benchmarking suite for face-centered-cubic (FCC) nickel that evaluates 47 quantitative metrics spanning both standard tests (equation of state, elastic constants, surface energies and phonons) and application-specific scenarios such as defect formation and migration, grain boundaries, step edges, close-range interactions, and vacancy cluster energetics. Using this framework, we assess 34 interatomic potentials from the OpenKIM repository, including pairwise, embedded-atom, modified-embedded-atom, angular-dependent, and spectral neighbor analysis potentials (SNAP). Results are compared against ab initio benchmarks compiled from the literature. Most potentials accurately reproduce lattice parameters, elastic constants, and surface energies, whereas predictive accuracy degrades for migration barriers and short-range compression. Principal-component analysis identifies correlated property groups and a partially orthogonal component associated with migration and short-range physics, revealing Pareto trade-offs between accuracy domains. SNAP models occupy the lowest-error frontier, although several embedded-atom potentials remain competitive across many metrics. The framework provides a reproducible baseline for potential selection, highlights systematic limitations across formalisms, and supports benchmarking-in-the-loop strategies for developing next-generation machine-learning potentials for Ni and Ni-based alloys.</description>

      <title>Oxidation State Dynamics and Emerging Patterns in Magnetite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetite is an important mineral with many interesting applications related to its magnetic, electrical and thermal properties. Typically studied by electronic structure calculations, these methods are unable to capture the complex ion dynamics at relevant temperatures, time and length scales. We present a hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics (MC/MD) method based on iron oxidation state exchange for accurate atomistic modelling of bulk magnetite, magnetite surfaces and nanoparticles that captures the complex ionic dynamics. By comparing oxidation state patterns with those obtained from density functional theory, we confirmed the accuracy of our approach. Lattice distortions leading to the stabilisation of excess charges and a critical surface thickness at which the oxidation states transition from ordered to disordered were observed. This simple yet efficient approach paves the way for elucidating aspects of oxidation state ordering of inverse spinel structures in general and battery materials in particular.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Investigation of the Physical and Thermoelectric Properties of Chalcogenide Compounds for Waste-Heat Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving energy efficiency by recovering waste heat and providing thermal protection is of high technological importance. This work investigates the chalcogenide compounds CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 using density functional theory and BoltzTraP2 calculations. Both materials are dynamically stable, brittle, and elastically anisotropic. Electronic structure calculations show direct band gaps that range from 1.0 to 2.2 electronvolt. Carrier effective masses are favorable, with CdGa2Te4 showing light electrons equal to 0.21 times the free electron mass and ZnGa2Te4 showing moderately heavy carriers equal to 0.39 times the free electron mass. Thermoelectric transport calculations yield large Seebeck coefficients of about 108 to 119 microvolt per kelvin. The thermoelectric figure of merit ZT increases from about 0.4 at 50 K to about 0.78 at 800 kelvin, indicating promising thermoelectric performance. For thermal barrier coating applications, both compounds combine ultralow lattice thermal conductivity with moderate melting points around 790 to 850 K and small thermal expansion coefficients, which helps resist thermal stress. Overall, CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 are multifunctional materials suitable for efficient waste heat recovery and durable thermal barrier operation below 900 K.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic-Strain Control of The Magnetic Structure in Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first principles study is conducted to explore the changes in the magnetic structure of Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN under anisotropic biaxial strain. Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN is an antiperovskite with a structure similar to that of an ideal cubic perovskite. Several manganese nitride antiperovskites including Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN were reported to have a frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure. Successful electric switching of its magnetic structure has been reported. Furthermore, despite a cubic lattice symmetry, the magnetic symmetry is rhombohedral, allowing a piezomagnetic response. Tensile biaxial strain has been shown to produce a net magnetic moment by inducing in-plane spin canting. Compressive biaxial strain has been used to induce a spin-polarized ferro- or ferrimagnetic phase. In this study, anisotropic strain in the (001) plane is applied, outlining a magnetic phase diagram that can predict the properties when growing Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN thin films on noncubic substrates. The lattice vectors along the a and b crystallographic axes are strained by -5\% to 5\% in percentwise increments in all permutations. An extensive phase diagram is mapped, revealing multiple combinations of strain applied to the two lattice vectors that result in a ferro- or ferrimagnetic transition. Unlike previous results, not only strictly compressive strain on both lattice vectors, but combinations of tensile and compressive strain, as well as uniaxial strain, are seen producing the magnetic phase transitions. Furthermore, while biquadratic strain was seen producing a net moment in the [110] direction under tensile strain and [\bar{1}\bar{1}0] under compressive strain, anisotropic strain allows tuning the direction of the net magnetization.</description>

      <title>MACE Foundation Models for Lattice Dynamics: A Benchmark Study on Double Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in materials informatics and artificial intelligence has led to the emergence of foundational energy models for material chemistry, as represented by the suite of MACE-based foundation models, bringing a significant breakthrough in universal potentials for inorganic solids. As to all method developments in computational materials science, performance benchmarking against existing high-level data with focusing on specific applications, is critically needed to understand the limitations in the models, thus facilitating the ongoing improvements in the model development process, and occasionally, leading to significant conceptual leaps in materials theory. Here, using our own published DFT (Density Functional Theory) database of room-temperature dynamic stability and vibrational anharmonicity for $\sim2000$ cubic halide double perovskites, we benchmarked the performances of four different variants of the MACE foundation models for screening the dynamic stabilities of inorganic solids. Our analysis shows that, as anticipated, the model accuracy improves with more training data. The dynamic stabilities of weakly anharmonic materials (as predicted by DFT) are more accurately reproduced by the foundation model, than those highly anharmonic and dynamically unstable ones. The predominant source of error in predicting the dynamic stability arises predominantly from the amplification of errors in atomic forces when predicting the harmonic phonon properties through the computation of the Hessian matrix, less so is the contribution from possible differences in the range of the configurational spaces that are sampled by DFT and the foundation model in molecular dynamics. We hope that our present findings will stimulate future works towards more physics-inspired approaches in assessing the accuracy of foundation models for atomistic modelling.</description>

      <title>Interatomic potential development for topological insulator Bi1-xSbx and its dislocation by force-following active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a force following active learning algorithm that integrates density functional theory DFT with the Gaussian Approximation Potential GAP framework to develop a robust interatomic potential IP for a dislocation in a topological insulator Bi1xSbx. Starting from an initial potential IP0 trained on unit cell data from strained Bi Sb binaries our active learning approach iteratively refines the IP during a structural relaxation. In each cycle if the force error uncertainty of any atom near the dislocation core exceeds a threshold value the IPi is efficiently retrained IPi to IPi1 by incorporating DFT computed forces and energies of atoms near the high uncertainty atom. This strategy ensures that the relaxation process maintains a low force error until full convergence is achieved. Consequently the final IP here IP5 has two capabilities 1 it reproduces the relaxation pathway observed during the active learning process unlike the initial IP0 which lacks prior dislocation core knowledge and 2 it captures the lattice and elastic properties of Bi Sb binaries across a range of Sb concentrations. We also evaluate dislocation properties Peierls stresses and dislocation generation by compression to assess the performance of the trained potential IP5.</description>

      <title>Zero-Dimensional Stacking Domains Enable Strong-Ductile Synergy in Additive Manufactured Titanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alloying by addition of oxygen interstitials during additive manufacturing provides new routes to strengthen and toughen metals and alloys. The underlying mechanisms by which such interstitial atoms lead to enhanced properties remain, however, unclear, not least due a lack of quantitative atomic-scale models linking microstructure to properties. Here using quasi-3D imaging based on multi-slice electron ptychography, we reveal the importance of a new type of interstitial-character lattice defect, namely zero-dimensional stacking domains (ZDSDs), present in high density in AM-processed oxygen-modulated pure titanium. These ZDSDs promote slip diversity, and support intense work hardening, enabling a three-fold enhancement in both strength and ductility in Ti-0.45O compared to conventional pure Ti. The work demonstrates the potential for using interstitial solutes to enhance mechanical properties in a range of critical engineering alloys.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering enabled by charge density wave transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering has emerged as a powerful approach for dynamically tailoring the electronic structures of quantum materials through time-periodic light fields generated by ultrafast laser pulses. The light fields can transiently dress Bloch electrons, creating novel electronic states inaccessible in equilibrium. While such temporal modulation provides dynamic control, spatially periodic modulations, such as those arising from charge density wave (CDW) order, can also dramatically reconstruct the band structure through real-space symmetry breaking. The interplay between these two distinct forms of modulation-temporal and spatial-opens a new frontier in electronic-phase-dependent Floquet engineering. Here we demonstrate this concept experimentally in the prototypical CDW material 1T-TiSe$_2$. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES) with mid-infrared pumping, we observe a striking pump-induced instantaneous downshift of the valence band maximum (VBM), which is in sharp contrast to the subsequent upward shift on picosecond timescale associated with CDW melting. Most remarkably, the light-induced VBM downshift is observed exclusively in the CDW phase and only when the pump pulse is present, reaching maximum when pumping near resonance with the CDW gap. These observations unequivocally reveal the critical role of CDW in the Floquet engineering of TiSe$_2$. Our work demonstrates how time-periodic drives can synergistically couple to spatially periodic modulations to create non-equilibrium electronic states, establishing a new paradigm for Floquet engineering enabled by spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GoodRegressor, a general-purpose, C++-based symbolic regression framework for interpretable materials modeling, is presented. The workflow consists of five modules, parser, designer, curator, regressor, and designer (as a post-process), that systematically explore descriptor combinations, nonlinear transformations, and interaction terms to construct compact and physically interpretable models. Applied to oxygen-ion conductors, the framework successfully predicts activation energies and Arrhenius prefactors with high accuracy ($R^2=0.804$ and $R^2=0.723$, respectively) and reveals clear physical trends linking ionic transport (particularly activation energy) to coordination environment, elastic moduli, and lattice flexibility. GoodRegressor bridges data-driven prediction and physical understanding, providing a transparent and extensible platform for symbolic regression applicable across diverse materials systems.</description>

      <title>Chemical States and Local Structure in Cu-Deficient CuInSe2 Thin Films: Insights into Engineering and Bandgap Narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cu-deficient CuxInSe2 (x larger than 0.3) phase can be stabilized as a thin film. A uniform Cu-deficient composition with a chalcopyrite structure was obtained by the precision engineering of a two-step synthesis process involving electron-beam evaporation and Se vapor deposition. Detailed structural and chemical analyses were performed employing various X-ray and microscopic techniques to demonstrate that the chemical states and local structure in the Cu-Se-In tetrahedral networks change with the loss of Cu, the In-Se bond becomes shorter, and the In ions become excessively oxidized without phase separation. Moreover, the results indicate that the bandgap narrowing is primarily attributed to the reconstruction of In3+d 5s orbital states. The bandgap narrows from 1.51 eV to 1.4 eV, which is optimal for the photon absorber. Therefore, cation-deficient selenide is promising for stable nontoxic photovoltaics with tunable bandgaps.</description>

      <title>Aqueous Preparation of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals Under Ambient Conditio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have had a profound impact on numerous emerging optoelectronic technologies, achieving performance metrics that rival or exceed incumbent materials. This impact is underpinned by the exceptional properties of MHPs, including tuneable band gaps, high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths and combined with uncomplicated synthesis methods. However, current MHP production relies on the toxic solvents, which pose significant environmental and health risks. Moreover, these methods often require complex multi component solvent systems and thermal processing to achieve the desired material phases, further hindering scalability and sustainability. Overcoming these challenges is critical to the future development of MHP-based technologies. Overcoming these challenges is critical to the future development of MHP-based technologies. Here, we present a novel water-based solvent system and synthetic approach for the preparation of size-controlled CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals in ambient air and at room temperature. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of CsPbBr3 erovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exceeds 60 precent. To demonstrate the light to current conversion ability of our PNCs a series of photoconductors were prepared, with the best performing devices achieving a specific detectivity (D*) of 1.2 x 10^11 Jones. Thus, this green, scalable, and low-cost approach offers a sustainable pathway for precise size and compositional control of MHP nanocrystals, opening new possibilities for environmentally friendly optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Ideal Nodal-Sphere Semimetal in the Three-Dimensional Boron Allotrope CT-B$_{24}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal-sphere semimetals (NSSMs), featuring spherical band degeneracies in momentum space, constitute a fascinating class of topological materials. However, their realization in real materials is severely hampered by discrete crystallographic symmetry constraints, often resulting in gapped ``pseudo'' nodal spheres. Here, combining first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we predict a new three-dimensional boron allotrope, CT-B$_{24}$, as a nearly ideal NSSM. Its structural stability is systematically confirmed by phonon calculations, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations at 600~K, and elastic constant analysis. Notably, the electronic structure of CT-B$_{24}$ exhibits two bands crossing linearly near the Fermi level, forming a quasi-nodal sphere around the $\Gamma$ point. The maximum energy gap is merely 0.008~meV, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the gaps reported in previous pseudo-NSSMs. Furthermore, the (001) surface hosts pronounced drumhead-like surface states located outside the projected nodal sphere, providing distinct signatures detectable by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The nodal sphere also demonstrates remarkable robustness and tunability under external strain, driving a topological phase transition from an NSSM to a Dirac semimetal and finally to a trivial insulator. Our work not only presents a superior material platform for exploring nodal-sphere physics but also suggests potential for strain-tunable topological devices.</description>

      <title>Robust Material Properties in Epitaxial In$_2$Te$_3$ Thin Films Across Varying Thicknesses</title>

Abstract: Sesqui-chalcogenides serve as a critical bridge between traditional semiconductors and quantum materials, offering significant potential in applications such as thermoelectrics, phase change memory, and topological insulators. While considerable attention has been focused on antimony- and bismuth-based compounds, characterized by substantial property changes upon reduction in film thickness, indium containing sesqui-chalcogenides like In$_2$Te$_3$ are emerging as promising candidates for photovoltaics and electronic devices. However, the effects of film thickness on the properties of In$_2$Te$_3$ remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate high-quality In$_2$Te$_3$ thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111) substrates across a thickness range from 2.7 nm to 24 nm. We employ X-ray diffraction, reflective high-energy electron diffraction and atomic force microscopy to analyze both the crystal structure and film morphology. Additionally, we utilize broadband optical spectroscopy alongside femtosecond pump-probe measurements and Raman spectroscopy to assess optical and vibrational properties, respectively. Our analysis reveals that material properties exhibit minimal dependence on film thickness, contrasting sharply with behavior observed in other chalcogenides such as Sb$_2$Te$_3$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, or GeTe. This phenomenon can be attributed to covalent bonding present in In$_2$Te$_3$, which differs from those in its antimony- and bismuth-containing counterparts.</description>

      <title>Persistence of Layer-Tolerant Defect Levels in ReS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors play a decisive role in determining their electronic, optical, catalytic and quantum properties. Understanding how defect energy levels respond to variations in layer thickness is essential for achieving reproducible and scalable device performance. We report the persistence of layer-tolerant defect levels in rhenium disulfide (ReS2), where both donor- and acceptor-type charge transition levels remain nearly unchanged from monolayer to bulk in both AA and AB stacking. The associated two-level quantum system also retains its character across thicknesses, enabling ReS2 to serve as a platform for layer-tolerant single-photon emitters. The invariance arises from the interplay between electronic energy minimization and structural relaxation, which together counteract quantum confinement and reduced dielectric screening. Additionally, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling in ReS2 plays a crucial role. Our findings uncover the microscopic origin of this unique behavior, distinguishing ReS2 from other transitionmetal dichalcogenides and highlighting its potential for thickness-independent optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Uncovering critical temperature dependence in Heusler magnets via explicit machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ interpretable explicit machine learning to analyze the material dependence of the magnetic transition temperature $T_c$ in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic Heusler compounds. For around 200 compounds, we consider both experimental $T_c$ and calculated $T_c$ using \textit{ab initio} determination of magnetic interactions together with a Monte-Carlo solution. We use the hierarchical dependence extraction (HDE) procedure [Mor\'ee and Arita, Phys. Rev. B 110, 014502 (2024)] to extract the dependencies of $T_c$ on chemical proportions and magnetic moments from the main order to the higher order, and construct an explicit expression of $T_c$ from these dependencies. The main results are: (a) $T_c$ is mainly controlled by the proportions of Fe, Co, and Mn, and increases with these proportions, consistent with previous machine learning analyses of ferromagnetic materials. (b) The HDE describes $T_c$ with an accuracy that is comparable to that of other machine learning procedures. (c) The HDE expression of $T_c$ can be interpreted as a generalized order parameter that increases with increasing magnetization amplitude, in qualitative agreement with various theories of phase transitions. These results strengthen our understanding of the material dependence of $T_c$ in collinear Heusler magnets and motivate the further use of HDE in material design.</description>

Abstract: Tip functionalization in AFM allows imaging organic nano-structures with sub-molecular resolution. Here, recent progress by using atomically defined copper-oxide tips is discussed.

      <title>Stability Criteria and Optoelectronic Properties of Mg3ZBr3 (Z = As, Sb, Bi) Perovskites for Evaluating the Performance in PIN Photo Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The toxicity and stability issues of lead-based perovskites motivate the search for non-toxic, durable alternatives. This work examines lead-free $\mathrm{Mg_3ZBr_3}$ ($Z=\mathrm{As,Sb,Bi}$) halide perovskites as optoelectronic materials, with emphasis on $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and $\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$. First-principles calculations establish cubic $Pm\bar{3}m$ frameworks stabilized by strong Mg--Br linkages, and indirect band gaps of $2.0645\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and $1.6533\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$ obtained using hybrid functionals. Optical spectra show a rapid rise in absorption above the gap and an increasing static dielectric response along $\mathrm{As}\rightarrow\mathrm{Sb}\rightarrow\mathrm{Bi}$, indicating strengthened light--matter coupling. Phonon dispersions lack imaginary branches, confirming dynamical stability, and exhibit large mode anharmonicity (Gr\"uneisen signatures) consistent with soft-lattice heat transport. Moving down the pnictogen series expands the lattice and lowers the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, while enhanced pnictogen--Br $p$-orbital hybridization and stereochemically active $n\mathrm{s}^{2}$ lone pairs (Sb, Bi) narrow the band gap and increase the optical dielectric response. Elastic analyses confirm Born stability and moderate stiffness, with Hill-averaged bulk moduli decreasing from approximately $44\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$) to $35\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3BiBr_3}$). Drift--diffusion $p$--$i$--$n$ simulations qualitatively track band-edge-limited spectra, aligning with the computed gaps. Together, these results position these materials as promising lead-free candidates for stable thin-film photodiode and photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic-like Excitation in Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroics are materials with coexisting electric and magnetic orders that are of central importance for fundamental research and applications in sensor and information technologies. However, intrinsic multiferroics that operate at room temperature remain rare due to an apparent incompatibility between magnetism and ferroelectricity. Here we predict that a pure ferroelectric hosts multiferroic-like quasiparticles that simultaneously carry \emph{static} magnetic and electric dipoles. The electric dipole moment emerges from the parity-odd anharmonicity of the ferroelectric dynamics, while the magnetic moment has both paramagnetic and diamagnetic origins generated by circularly polarized transverse fluctuations of the ferroelectric polarization. In contrast to the established ``dynamical multiferroicity" of conventional phonons, which involve only \emph{oscillating} electric dipoles, these ``multiferron" modes produce a colossal electric-field-tunable second-harmonic optical response as well as a magnetoelectric cross coupling. Multiferrons open a new route toward nonlinear THz optical applications and offer multiferroic functionalities in simple ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Defect Landscape of Orthorhombic Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$ from First-Principles Calculations: The Role of Oxygen Interstitials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brownmillerite-type oxide Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$ (BIO) is a potential candidate as an electrolyte material for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in solid oxide fuel cells. Despite its structural relation to perovskite oxides, the defect chemistry of BIO has remained largely unexplored. Using Density Functional Theory within the generalized gradient approximation, complemented by selected hybrid-functional calculations, we evaluate the formation energies, charge transition levels, and concentrations as a function of oxygen partial pressure of vacancies, oxygen interstitials, Frenkel pairs, and substitutional Cr doping. Our results reveal that oxygen vacancies and interstitials dominate the intrinsic defect landscape. Among the interstitials, we identify stable dumbbell configurations that remain neutral across the entire band gap. Other interstitial configurations show charged states and become the prevailing compensating defect at high oxygen partial pressures. For extrinsic doping, we find that Cr preferentially substitutes at the tetrahedral In site and behaves as a donor. Its negative formation energies suggest the formation of secondary phases, possibly the tetragonal Cr-doped BIO. These results provide a first picture of the thermodynamics of intrinsic and extrinsic defects in BIO and set the stage for future investigations into the tetragonal phase and the diffusion dynamics of oxygen vacancies and interstitials.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Investigation of Sr2PrSbO6 Double Perovskite: An Emerging Aspirant for Electrocatalysis, Plasmonic, Photonics, Thermoelectric and Solar Cell Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the structural properties, chemical stability, and electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ using first-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). The goal of this study is to evaluate its potential contribution to next-generation electrocatalysts, optoelectronic devices, and thermoelectric systems. The structural optimization reveals that $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ crystallizes in a stable cubic perovskite structure with space group $Fm\bar{3}m$. The calculated formation energy indicates high thermodynamic stability, confirming the viability of $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ for practical applications. The electronic band structure calculations show that $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct bandgap of $3.488~\mathrm{eV}$ at the $\Gamma$-point. The calculated density of states (DOS) indicates significant contributions from O $2p$, Sb $5p$, and Pr $5d$ orbitals. Optical property calculations, including the dielectric function and absorption coefficient, reveal strong absorption in the UV regions, making $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications such as UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE) tandem systems. At room temperature, the calculated dimensionless quantity $ZT$ is $0.33$, which indicates this material as a possible candidate for thermoelectric applications. Our results will serve as a benchmark for future experimental and theoretical research on the properties of this material.</description>

      <title>Donor doping-regulated dislocation plasticity across the length scale in SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Donor doping as a form of point defect engineering is a popular strategy for tuning the physical properties of functional oxides. The renewed interest in dislocation-tuned functional properties in ceramics requires a deeper understanding of point defect-dislocation interactions. Here, we study the room-temperature dislocation plasticity of donor-doped (0.05 wt% and 0.5 wt% Nb as dopants) single-crystal SrTiO3 across the length scale, using a combinatorial mechanical deformation approach including nanoindentation (nano-/microscale), Brinell indentation (mesoscale), and uniaxial bulk compression (macroscale). Compared to the nominally undoped sample, Nb-doped SrTiO3 exhibits higher nanoindentation pop-in load and lower indentation creep rates, suggesting less favored dislocation nucleation and motion. Under cyclic Brinell indentation, the discrete slip traces on the 0.5 wt% Nb-doped sample indicate suppressed dislocation multiplication. Extending to bulk compression, 0.5 wt% Nb-doped samples exhibit ~50% higher yield strength compared to that of the nominally undoped sample. We further validated the findings by comparing with an acceptor (Fe)-doped single crystal with equivalent doping concentrations. This length-scale bridging approach consistently reveals suppressed dislocation nucleation, multiplication, and motion in the 0.5 wt% Nb-doped samples. These insights underline the importance of dislocation-defect chemistry on the mechanical behavior of functional oxides.</description>

      <title>Non-Arrhenius Li-ion transport and grain-size effects in argyrodite solid electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argyrodite solid electrolytes, such as Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl, exhibit some of the highest known superionic conductivities. Yet, the mechanistic understanding of Li$^+$ transport in realistic argyrodite microstructures -- where atomic-scale mechanisms interplay with continuum-scale dynamics at grain boundaries -- remains limited. Here, we resolve Li$^+$ transport in silico by developing accurate machine-learning potentials via closed-loop active learning and embedding the potentials in a multiscale modeling framework that integrates molecular dynamics with finite element simulations. We show that bulk diffusion barriers scale linearly with anion radius. Grain boundaries have opposite effects depending on the bulk -- enhancing Li$^+$ diffusion in low-diffusivity phases but suppressing it in fast-diffusing ones. Simulations of polycrystalline Li$_6$PS$_5$I reveal non-Arrhenius transport behaviors consistent with experiments. Grain-size-dependent predictions indicate that grain refinement improves intergranular contacts in argyrodites without compromising superionic conductivity, while nanosizing can activate ionic transport in electrolytes lacking intrinsic superionic behavior. Our findings highlight the decisive role of microstructure in developing solid electrolytes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge carriers in organic semiconductors form polarons, which are self-localized states stabilized by interactions with their environment. Using a dielectric-stabilized tight-binding model parameterized from first-principles calculations, we compute ground and excited polaron states in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Our results quantitatively reproduce key mid-infrared absorption features, notably the chain-length-dependent shift of the intrachain polaron excitation peak (peak B) and its variation between regioregular and regiorandom P3HT. Comparison to an alternative stabilization mechanism based on local ring distortions reveals that dielectric polarization dominates polaron formation, as ring distortions yield insufficient binding and excitation energies inconsistent with experiments. These findings clarify the microscopic origin of polarons in conjugated polymers and provide a predictive framework linking polaron energetics to spectroscopic observables, advancing the understanding of charge transport in organic semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational models are used here for simulating diffusion-controlled redistribution of hydrogen that is picked up by zirconium-base nuclear fuel cladding during light water reactor operation. Axial localization of hydrogen, leading to localized precipitation of zirconium hydrides at lower-temperature regions near interpellet gaps, is studied with a bespoke model, while radial diffusion, leading to formation of a densely hydrided rim subjacent to the waterside oxide layer, is studied with a more general model. The calculated results are compared with experimental observations and similar computational studies reported in the literature. The results underline the importance of hydrogen redistribution with regard to local embrittlement of the cladding tubes.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Magnetism, Band Gap Tuning, Optical, and Thermoelectric Responses in Fe-Doped YMnO$_3$: Insights from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hexagonal multiferroic oxide YMnO$_3$ has demonstrated applications in various fields and is widely researched due to its interesting properties. Since Mn(3d)--O(2p) interactions predominate close to the Fermi level, doping in the B-site (Mn) with Fe provides a way to modulate the band gap and magnetic order of YMnO$_3$. The need for a lead-free ferroelectric material with a narrow band gap is crucial for absorbing a wide range of the solar spectrum. Density functional theory calculations were carried out using GGA and meta-GGA (for an accurate description of the band gap) exchange correlation functional for the Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ multiferroics. Various magnetic configurations were analyzed, finding collinear G-type AFM as the least energy state. The hexagonal lattice is retained after Fe doping with slight distortions and a change in lattice constants. Fe doping reduces spin frustration and induces magnetization, while reducing the band gap from 1.88 eV for pure to 1.19 eV for a 25 percent doping concentration. Additionally, Fe doping exhibits an enhanced dielectric response, characterized by an increase in the static dielectric constant and the presence of strong absorption peaks in the visible and UV energy ranges. Thermoelectric studies illustrate enhanced conductivity due to increased charge carriers induced by doping. In summary, first-principles predictions of structural, electronic, optical, and transport behavior in Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ provide a foundation for tailoring this oxide in photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Scale-bridging dislocation plasticity in MgO at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations in ceramics have gained renewed research interest contrasting the traditional belief that ceramics are brittle. Understanding dislocation mechanics in representative oxides is beneficial for effective dislocation engineering. Here, we use MgO single crystals with mechanically seeded dislocation densities from ~10^12 to ~10^15 m-2 to investigate the mechanical behavior such as yield and fracture. Nano-/micro-pillar compression tests reveal a dislocation density-dependent yield strength, mediated by the varying dominating dislocation mechanisms from nucleation to multiplication/motion. The dislocation-seeded samples can achieve a much-improved compressive plastic strain beyond ~70%, with a high yield strength of ~2.35 GPa (diameter of ~400 nm). Complementary bulk compression tests, along with digital image correlation (DIC), demonstrate a consistent dislocation-mediated deformation and a notable size effect, with bulk samples exhibiting much reduced yield strength (~120 MPa) compared to the nano-/micro-pillars. Using three-dimensional Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (3D-DDD) simulation, we further underline the dislocation avalanche and work hardening during compression. This study provides new insights into dislocation-mediated plasticity in MgO across the length scale with tunable dislocation densities.</description>

      <title>An Encoder-Decoder Foundation Chemical Language Model for Generative Polymer Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning has advanced polymer discovery, yet direct generation of chemically valid and synthesizable polymers without exhaustive enumeration remains a challenge. Here we present polyT5, an encoder-decoder chemical language model based on the T5 architecture, trained to understand and generate polymer structures. polyT5 enables both property prediction and the targeted generation of polymers conditioned on desired property values. We demonstrate its utility for dielectric polymer design, seeking candidates with dielectric constant &gt;3, bandgap &gt;4 eV, and glass transition temperature &gt;400 K, alongside melt-processability and solubility requirements. From over 20,000 generated promising candidates, one was experimentally synthesized and validated, showing strong agreement with predictions. To further enhance usability, we integrated polyT5 within an agentic AI framework that couples it with a general-purpose LLM, allowing natural language interaction for property prediction and generative design. Together, these advances establish a versatile and accessible framework for accelerated polymer discovery.</description>

      <title>Micromechanical characterisation of osteoarthritic subchondral bone by micropillar compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifaceted joint disease which poses significant socioeconomic burdens and remains a significant clinical challenge. Evidence suggests that structural and mechanical changes in subchondral bone influence the pathogenesis and development of OA, leading to diminished bone quality and cartilage degeneration. While changes in microstructure and tissue scale elastic properties are well reported, the tissue yield response of subchondral bone in OA and their correlation with compositional changes have not been investigated. Here, we performed quasistatic micropillar compression and nanoindentation within the subchondral bone plate and trabeculae of hydrated non-diseased (ND) and OA affected specimens retrieved from the distal tibia in vivo. The micropillars, extracted by laser ablation, exhibited a taper angle which mandated the use of an in silico micropillar compression routine to back-calculate elastic modulus and strength of the bone tissue that comprised each micropillar. Elastic modulus remained unchanged between ND and OA subchondral bone, whereas strength increased from 46.0 MPa to 57.3 MPa in OA subchondral trabecular bone but not in the bone plate. Micropillar matched Raman spectroscopy and quantitative backscattered electron imaging revealed mineralisation is the underlying determinant of elastic modulus and strength at the microscale. By combining micromechanical and tissue compositional analyses, we investigated how the mechanical properties are related and how these properties are affected in subchondral bone by OA. Our results may be of value in the development and optimisation of interventions used to alleviate the socioeconomic burdens associated with this debilitating joint disease.</description>

      <title>Impact of Switching Layer Architecture on Power Consumption in RRAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that porous helical WOx architectures enable a distinct low-power regime for planar ITO/WOx/ITO resistive random-access devices. While thin film and helical devices behave similarly at a 5 mA compliance, only helical devices sustain reproducible operation at 500 uA, where RESET voltages reduce by ~60%, switching currents decrease by 68-75%, and SET/RESET power drops by ~89% and ~83%. With helical devices operating at 500 uA, the memory window expands 400-600% due to selective suppression of high- resistive-state leakage, yielding both lower-power and improved read margin in a regime inaccessible to thin film devices. These results highlight geometry-driven field enhancement and confinement as practical design principles for low-power, high-margin resistive memories and point toward opportunities in transparent, flexible, and high-surface-area material systems.</description>

      <title>Evolve with Your Research - Stepwise System Evolution from Document-driven to Fact-centric Research Data Management in Materials Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digitalisation of research requires data management systems capable of supporting a broad spectrum of usage scenarios, ranging from document-oriented repositories to fully factographic environments. This paper introduces a methodological approach for the stepwise development of such systems, illustrated by the MatInf Research Data Management System (RDMS). The proposed framework combines a graph-based STAR paradigm-emphasising Statefulness, Traceability, Aim, and Result-with the SET methodology, which enables systematic Standardisation, Extraction, and Testing of research data. Together, these principles provide a pathway towards FAIR-compliant data infrastructures, facilitating reproducibility, re-use, and integration of heterogeneous materials science data. By demonstrating the gradual consolidation of research outputs into unified datasets, this study highlights how adaptive RDMS design can support accelerated scientific discovery and enhance collaborative research in large-scale projects.</description>

      <title>Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piezoelectric plates, which become electrically polarised in response to bending, have recently been proposed for water wave energy conversion. However, piezoelectric materials (e.g. Polyvinylidene Fluoride) can be anisotropic, which makes them challenging to model in three dimensions. This paper considers the simpler problem of water wave scattering by an anisotropic elastic plate, i.e., the piezoelectric effect is ignored. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the elastic plate modes. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry. Although not considered in this paper, the method we present is applicable to piezoelectric plates, and thereby facilitates the extension of piezoelectric wave energy converter models to the three dimensional water wave setting.</description>

      <title>A Hall viscosity for skyrmion via magnon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a Hall viscosity term directly from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), that breaks parity symmetry, in the skyrmion motion of insulating magnets by time-averaging the magnon contribution to all orders. The viscosity term is proportional to the skyrmion charge. Skyrmion Hall angle shows significant dependence on the skyrmion shape and size, the ratio of exchange over DMI parameters, while roughly independent of the Gilbert damping parameter. The Hall angles have the same magnitude for opposite skyrmion charges. We speculate a velocity-dependent Hall viscosity contribution to seek asymmetric Hall angles for the opposite charges.</description>

      <title>Probing Hidden Symmetry and Altermagnetism with Sub-Picometer Sensitivity via Nonlinear Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray and neutron diffraction are foundational tools for determining crystal structures, but their resolution limits can lead to misassignments, especially in materials with subtle distortions or competing phases. Here, we demonstrate the use of nonlinear transport as a complementary approach to uncover hidden crystal symmetries, using the strongly correlated Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a case study. Below 48 K (T$_S$), where the magnetic moments of the antiferromagnetic phase reorient from the a- to the b-axis, leading to a pseudogap opening, our measurements, with support of DFT, reveal a previously overlooked lower-symmetry phase. This is manifested by the emergence of longitudinal nonlinear resistance (NLR) along the b-axis below T$_S$, providing direct evidence of combined translational and time-reversal symmetry breaking. This response also suggests a transformation from a conventional antiferromagnet into an altermagnet. The lower-symmetry phase arises from a subtle lattice distortion (~0.1 pm) associated with the magnetic transition at T$_S$, below the detection limit of conventional diffraction. Moreover, this NLR below T$_S$ is accompanied by a nonlinear Hall effect, both of which are enhanced by the large quantum metric associated with Weyl chains near the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate nonlinear transport as a sensitive probe of hidden symmetry breaking and altermagnetism, complementing and extending beyond the reach of traditional diffraction and spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>All-Electrical Self-Switching of van der Waals Chiral Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have garnered significant attention due to their negligible stray field and ultrafast magnetic dynamics, which are promising for high-density and ultrafast spintronic applications. Their dual functionality as both spin sources and information carriers could enable all-electrical self-induced switching of antiferromagnetic order, offering great potential for ultra-compact spintronic devices. However, related progress is still elusive. Here, we report the deterministic switching of chiral antiferromagnetic orders induced by charge current at zero external magnetic field in the van der Waals (vdW) magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoTa3S6. This system exhibits strong interactions between cobalt atom magnetic moment lattice and itinerant electrons within the metallic layers, as demonstrated by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and topological Nernst effect measurements. Notably, the itinerant-localization interactions lead to current-induced chiral spin orbit torques as well as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange torques that interact with the localized magnetic moments, facilitating all-electrical switching of the chiral magnetic order in the CoTa3S6 flake. Our work opens a promising avenue for manipulating antiferromagnetic orders by delicately engineering the synergistic interactions between magnetic moments and itinerant electrons.</description>

      <title>Cavity modification of magnetoplasmon mode through coupling with intersubband polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of a multi-mode metal-insulator-metal cavity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a quantum well in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The TM cavity mode is strongly hybridized with an intersubband transition of the 2DEG, forming a polaritonic mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime, while the TE mode remains an almost purely cavity mode. The magnetoplasmon excitation emerging from the presence of the magnetic field couples with both TM and TE modes, exhibiting different coupling strengths and levels of spatial field inhomogeneity. While the strong homogeneity of the bare TE mode gives rise to the standard anticrossing of strong coupling, the inhomogeneous polaritonic TM mode is shown to activate an observable Coulombic effect in the spectral response, often referred to as non-locality. This experiment demonstrates a cavity-induced modification of the 2DEG response and offers a new route to probing the effect of Coulomb interactions in ultrastrongly coupled systems via reshaping of their cavity mode profiles.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Antiparallel Domains in 2D Hexagonal Boron Nitride Uncovered by Interferometric Nonlinear Optical Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) supports a wide range of two-dimensional (2D) technologies, yet assessing its crystalline quality over large areas remains a fundamental challenge. Both antiparallel domains, an intrinsic outcome of epitaxy on high-symmetry substrates, and associated structural defects have long evaded optical detection. Here, we show that interferometric second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging provides a powerful, nondestructive probe of lattice orientation and structural integrity in chemical vapor deposition-grown hBN. This approach reveals the ubiquitous formation of antiparallel domains and quantifies their impact on crystalline order. SHG intensity also emerges as a direct optical metric of domain disorder, spanning three orders of magnitude across films produced by ten different growth routes. Correlation with Raman spectroscopy establishes a unified framework for evaluating crystalline quality. Beyond hBN, this method offers a high-throughput route to wide-area structural imaging in various non-centrosymmetric materials, advancing their deployment in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital magnetization (OM) in Sierpinski carpet (SC) and triangle (ST) fractal is theoretically investigated by using Haldane model as a prototypical example. The OM calculation is performed following two distinct approaches; employing the definition and local markers formalism. Both methods coincides for all systems analyzed. For the SC, higher fractal generations create a dense set of edge states, resulting in a staircase profile, leading to oscillations in the magnetization as a function of the chemical potential. In contrast, the ST self-similarity produces distinct fractal-induced spectral gaps, which manifest as constant plateaus in the magnetization. The STs exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to edge terminations. Our results reveal how quantum confinement in fractal structures affects the electronic orbital angular momentum, pointing to possible pathways for exploring novel orbitronics in systems with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Coherent and Dynamic Small Polaron Delocalization in CuFeO$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small polarons remain a significant bottleneck in the realization of efficient devices using transition metal oxides. Routes to engineer small polaron coupling to electronic states and lattice modes to control carrier localization remain unclear. Here, we measure the formation of small polarons in CuFeO$_{2}$ using transient extreme ultraviolet reflection spectroscopy and compare it to theoretical predictions in realistically parameterized Holstein models, demonstrating that polaron localization depends on its coupling to the high-frequency versus low-frequency components of the phonon bath. We measure that small polaron formation occurs on a comparable ~100 fs timescale to other Fe(III) compounds. After formation, a dynamic delocalization of the small polaron occurs through a coherent lattice expansion between Fe-O layers and charge-sharing with surrounding Fe(IV) states. Our simulations of polaron formation dynamics reveal that two major factors dictate polaron formation timescales: phonon density and reorganization energy distributions between acoustic and optical modes, matching experimental findings. Our work provides a detailed, real-time observation of how electronic-structural coupling in a polaron-host material can be leveraged to suppress polaronic effects for various applications.</description>

Abstract: A neuroevolution potential (NEP) for the ternary $\alpha$-Fe--C--H system was developed based on a database generated from spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations, achieving empirical potential efficiency with DFT accuracy. At the same power consumption, simulation speeds using NEP are comparable to, or even faster than, those with bond order potentials. The NEP achieves DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of scenarios commonly encountered in studies of $\alpha$-Fe- and $\alpha$-Fe--C under hydrogen environments. The NEP enables large-scale atomistic simulations with DFT-level accuracy at the cost of empirical potentials, offering a practical tool to study hydrogen embrittlement in steel.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the probability of detecting the most nontrivial conductivity behavior regimes in metals whose electron spectrum is described by the tight-binding approximation. These regimes are associated with the emergence of highly complex electron trajectories on the Fermi surface and correspond to a nontrivial (scaling) behavior of the conductivity tensor in strong magnetic fields. The geometry of such trajectories, as well as the corresponding conductivity regimes, have been well studied theoretically; however, they have not yet been observed experimentally. The results of our study allow us, in particular, to estimate the probability of their occurrence and to indicate the conditions for their possible detection for a wide class of conductors.</description>

      <title>Measuring vacancy-type defect density in monolayer semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted wide-spread interest due to their unique and tunable properties. Their optoelectronic, mechanical, and thermal properties are greatly influenced by crystal defects, which are, in turn, used to control these properties. However, experimental quantification of the density of defects, whether deliberately introduced or inherent, is very difficult in these atomically thin materials. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction can be used to measure the defect density in 15x20um monolayer MoS2, a prototypical 2D semiconductor, quickly and easily compared to standard methods. We present a simple analytic model, the lattice gas equation, that fully captures the relationship between atomic Bragg diffraction intensity and defect density. The model, combined with ab initio scattering calculations, shows that our technique can immediately be applied to a wide range of 2D materials, independent of sample chemistry or structure. Additionally, wafer-scale characterization is immediately possible.</description>

      <title>Terahertz radiation induced attractive-repulsive Fermi polaron conversion in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the rate of the direct optical conversion process which has a threshold where the terahertz photon energy equals to the Fermi polaron binding energy. This process features a characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold, due to final-state electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on the electron temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Large-scale stochastic propagation method beyond the sequential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ stochastic propagation method, which relies on the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation using random initial states, is widely used in large-scale first-principles calculations. In this work, we eliminate the conventional sequential computation of intermediate states by introducing a concurrent strategy that minimizes information redundancy. The new method, in its state-, moment-, and energy-based implementations, not only surpasses the time step constraint of sequential propagation but also maintains precision within the framework of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Systematic benchmarking on one billion atoms within the tight-binding model demonstrates that our new concurrent method achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup, enabling the rapid computation of a wide range of electronic, optical, and transport properties. This performance breakthrough offers valuable insights for enhancing other time-propagation algorithms, including those employed in large-scale stochastic density functional theory.</description>
