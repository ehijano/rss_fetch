      <title>Subgroups of symmetric groups: enumeration and asymptotic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the symmetric group $\mathrm{S}_n$ has $2^{n^2/16+o(n^2)}$ subgroups, settling a conjecture of Pyber from 1993. We also derive asymptotically sharp upper and lower bounds on the number of subgroups of $\mathrm{S}_n$ of various kinds, including the number of $p$-subgroups. In addition, we prove a range of theorems about random subgroups of $\mathrm{S}_n$. In particular, we prove the surprising result that for infinitely many $n$, the probability that a random subgroup of $\mathrm{S}_n$ is nilpotent is bounded away from $1$.</description>

      <title>Outer space and finiteness properties for symmetric automorphisms of RAAGs, and generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the symmetric (outer) automorphism group of a right-angled Artin group and construct for it a (spine of) Outer space. This `symmetric spine' is a contractible cube complex upon which the symmetric outer automorphism group acts properly and cocompactly. One artefact of our technique is a strengthening of the proof of contractibility of the untwisted spine, mimicking the original proof that Culler--Vogtmann Outer space is contractible, which may be of independent interest. We apply our results to derive finiteness properties for certain subgroups of outer automorphisms. In particular, we prove that the subgroup consisting of those outer automorphisms which permute any given finite set of conjugacy classes of a right-angled Artin group is of type \emph{VF}, and we show that the virtual cohomological dimension of the symmetric outer automorphism group is equal to both the dimension of the symmetric spine and the rank of a free abelian subgroup.</description>

      <title>Word problems and embedding-obstructions in cellular automata groups on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study groups of reversible cellular automata, or CA groups, on groups. More generally, we consider automorphism groups of subshifts of finite type on groups. It is known that word problems of CA groups on virtually nilpotent groups are in co-NP, and can be co-NP-hard. We show that under the Gap Conjecture of Grigorchuk, their word problems are PSPACE-hard on all other groups. On free and surface groups, we show that they are indeed always in PSPACE. On a group with co-NEXPTIME word problem, CA groups themselves have co-NEXPTIME word problem, and on the lamplighter group (which itself has polynomial-time word problem) we show they can be co-NEXPTIME-hard. We show also two nonembeddability results: the group of cellular automata on a non-cyclic free group does not embed in the group of cellular automata on the integers (this solves a question of Barbieri, Carrasco-Vargas and Rivera-Burgos); and the group of cellular automata in dimension $D$ does not embed in a group of cellular automata in dimension $d$ if $D \geq 3d+2$ (this solves a question of Hochman).</description>

      <title>Framed Braid Equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce framed versions of the $L$-moves and prove a one move theorem for the extension of the Markov theorem for framed braids. We further introduce framed versions of the Hilden and Pure Hilden groups, we give presentations and we use them to state and prove a framed version of the Birman theorem for framed links in plat representation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Cayley Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the problem of finding paths in Cayley graphs of groups and group actions, using the Rubik's cube as an example, and we list several more examples of significant mathematical interest. We then show how to formulate these problems in the framework of diffusion models. The exploration of the graph is carried out by the forward process, while finding the target nodes is done by the inverse backward process. This systematizes the discussion and suggests many generalizations. To improve exploration, we propose a ``reversed score'' ansatz which substantially improves over previous comparable algorithms.</description>

      <title>When is the Outer Space of a free product CAT(0)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing Culler and Vogtmann's Outer Space for the free group, Guirardel and Levitt construct an Outer Space for a free product of groups. We completely characterize when this space (or really its simplicial spine) supports an equivariant piecewise-Euclidean or piecewise-hyperbolic CAT(0) metric. Our results are mostly negative, extending thesis work of Bridson and related to thesis work of Cunningham. In particular, provided the dimension of the spine is at least three, it is never CAT(0). Surprisingly, we exhibit one family of free products for which the Outer Space is two-dimensional and does support an equivariant CAT(0) metric.</description>

      <title>The Andreadakis Problem for the McCool groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short paper, we show that the McCool group does not satisfy the Andreadakis equality from degree $7$, and we give a lower bound for the size of the difference between the two relevant filtrations. As a consequence, we see that the Andreadakis problem for the McCool group does not stabilize.</description>

      <title>The automorphism group of a strongly irreducible subshift on a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the automorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ of a non-trivial strongly irreducible subshift $X$ on an arbitrary infinite group $G$ and generalize classical results of Ryan, Kim and Roush.
  We generalize Ryan's theorem by showing that the center of $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ is generated by shifts by elements of the center of $G$ modded out by the kernel of the shift action.
  We generalize Kim and Roush's theorem by showing that if the free group $F_k$ of rank $k\geq 1$ embeds into $G$, then the automorphism group of any full $F_k$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$. If $X$ is an SFT, or more generally, if $X$ satisfies the strong topological Markov property, then we can weaken the conditions on $G$. In this case we show that the automorphism group of any full $\mathbb{Z}$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ provided $G$ is not locally finite, and that the automorphism group of any full $F_k$-shift embeds into $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ whenever $G$ is nonamenable. Our results rely on a new marker lemma which is valid for any nonempty strongly irreducible subshift on an infinite group.
  We remark that our results are new even for $G=\mathbb{Z}$ as they do not require the subshift to be an SFT.</description>
