      <title>Logistic Regression Analysis on the Dietary Behavior and the Risk of Nutritional Deficiency Dermatosis: The Case of Bicol Region, Philippines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed at exploring the relationship between dietary behavior and the risk of nutritional deficiency dermatoses (NDD) in the Bicol region of the Philippines, where malnutrition remains a public health concern. In particular, this study employed regression analysis in an existing data from the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) and investigated food purchase patterns on specific food groups such as cereal products, meat products, and dairy products to assess riboflavin intake among Bicolano households, which is a key contributor in the development of dermatosis. Findings revealed that the prevalence of nutritional deficiency dermatosis risk in Bicolanos is at 15.75%, with Masbate and Camarines Sur collectively contributing more than half of these cases. This can be traced to their dependence to rice (at most 1590.93 g/day) and plant-based diet (523.30 g/day) based on their daily food purchase, which were further found to significantly reduce the odds of NDD by 0.3% for every additional gram of purchase even when they are not notably rich in riboflavin. Fish products, together with typical sources of riboflavin such as meat, eggs, poultry, and dairy products were found to significantly reduce the odds of NDD by at most 3% per additional gram of purchase. The logistic regression model showed good fit, with significant Nagelkerke value of 0.765, with performance metrics showing overall accuracy of 94.1% and precision of 84.5%. Model suggests the need for nutrition interventions, with emphasis on the promotion of enriched variety of rice, improved access to agricultural markets with products rich in riboflavin, and public health strategies such as food diversity education which will enable Bicolanos to have sufficient amount of riboflavin in their body, thereby reducing the discomfort brought about by dermatosis and its other potential health consequences.</description>

      <title>GatingTree: Pathfinding Analysis of Group-Specific Effects in Cytometry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in cytometry technologies have led to a remarkable increase in the number of markers that can be analyzed simultaneously, presenting significant challenges in data analysis. Traditional approaches, such as dimensional reduction techniques and computational clustering, although popular, often face reproducibility challenges due to their heavy reliance on inherent data structures, preventing direct translation of their outputs into gating strategies to be used in downstream experiments. Here we propose the novel Gating Tree methodology, a pathfinding approach that investigates the multidimensional data landscape to unravel group-specific features without the use of dimensional reduction. This method employs novel measures, including enrichment scores and gating entropy, to effectively identify group-specific features within high-dimensional cytometric datasets. Our analysis, applied to both simulated and real cytometric datasets, demonstrates that the Gating Tree not only identifies group-specific features comprehensively but also produces outputs that are immediately usable as gating strategies for unequivocally identifying cell populations. In conclusion, the Gating Tree facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the multidimensional data landscape and provides experimentalists with practical, successive gating strategies that enhance cross-experimental comparisons and downstream analyses such as flow cytometric sorting.</description>

      <title>Nightbeat: Heart Rate Estimation From a Wrist-Worn Accelerometer During Sleep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's fitness bands and smartwatches typically track heart rates (HR) using optical sensors. Large behavioral studies such as the UK Biobank use activity trackers without such optical sensors and thus lack HR data, which could reveal valuable health trends for the wider population. In this paper, we present the first dataset of wrist-worn accelerometer recordings and electrocardiogram references in uncontrolled at-home settings to investigate the recent promise of IMU-only HR estimation via ballistocardiograms. Our recordings are from 42 patients during the night, totaling 310 hours. We also introduce a frequency-based method to extract HR via curve tracing from IMU recordings while rejecting motion artifacts. Using our dataset, we analyze existing baselines and show that our method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.88 bpm -- 76% better than previous approaches. Our results validate the potential of IMU-only HR estimation as a key indicator of cardiac activity in existing longitudinal studies to discover novel health insights. Our dataset, Nightbeat-DB, and our source code are available on GitHub: https://github.com/eth-siplab/Nightbeat.</description>

      <title>CurateGPT: A flexible language-model assisted biocuration tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective data-driven biomedical discovery requires data curation: a time-consuming process of finding, organizing, distilling, integrating, interpreting, annotating, and validating diverse information into a structured form suitable for databases and knowledge bases. Accurate and efficient curation of these digital assets is critical to ensuring that they are FAIR, trustworthy, and sustainable. Unfortunately, expert curators face significant time and resource constraints. The rapid pace of new information being published daily is exceeding their capacity for curation. Generative AI, exemplified by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), has opened up new possibilities for assisting human-driven curation. The design philosophy of agents combines the emerging abilities of generative AI with more precise methods. A curator's tasks can be aided by agents for performing reasoning, searching ontologies, and integrating knowledge across external sources, all efforts otherwise requiring extensive manual effort. Our LLM-driven annotation tool, CurateGPT, melds the power of generative AI together with trusted knowledge bases and literature sources. CurateGPT streamlines the curation process, enhancing collaboration and efficiency in common workflows. Compared to direct interaction with an LLM, CurateGPT's agents enable access to information beyond that in the LLM's training data and they provide direct links to the data supporting each claim. This helps curators, researchers, and engineers scale up curation efforts to keep pace with the ever-increasing volume of scientific data.</description>

      <title>What the %PCSA? Addressing Diversity in Lower-Limb Musculoskeletal Models: Age- and Sex-related Differences in PCSA and Muscle Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal (MSK) models offer a non-invasive way to understand biomechanical loads on joints and tendons, which are difficult to measure directly. Variations in muscle strength, especially relative differences between muscles, significantly impact model outcomes. Typically, scaled generic MSK models use maximum isometric forces that are not adjusted for different demographics, raising concerns about their accuracy. This review provides an overview on experimentally derived strength parameters, including physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), muscle mass (Mm), and relative muscle mass (%Mm), which is the relative distribution of muscle mass across the leg. We analysed differences by age and sex, and compared open-source lower limb MSK model parameters with experimental data from 57 studies. Our dataset, with records dating back to 1884, shows that uniformly increasing all maximum isometric forces in MSK models does not capture key muscle ratio differences due to age and sex. Males have a higher proportion of muscle mass in the rectus femoris and semimembranosus muscles, while females have a greater relative muscle mass in the pelvic (gluteus maximus and medius) and ankle muscles (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and extensor digitorum longus). Older adults have a higher relative muscle mass in the gluteus medius, while younger individuals show more in the gastrocnemius. Current MSK models do not accurately represent muscle mass distribution for specific age or sex groups, and none of them accurately reflect female muscle mass distribution. Further research is needed to explore musculotendon age- and sex differences.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary accumulation modelling in AMR: machine learning to infer and predict evolutionary dynamics of multi-drug resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can we understand and predict the evolutionary pathways by which bacteria acquire multi-drug resistance (MDR)? These questions have substantial potential impact in basic biology and in applied approaches to address the global health challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we review how a class of machine learning approaches called evolutionary accumulation modelling (EvAM) may help reveal these dynamics using genetic and/or phenotypic AMR datasets, without requiring longitudinal sampling. These approaches are well-established in cancer progression and evolutionary biology, but currently less used in AMR research. We discuss how EvAM can learn the evolutionary pathways by which drug resistances and AMR features are acquired as pathogens evolve, predict next evolutionary steps, identify influences between AMR features, and explore differences in MDR evolution between regions, demographics, and more. We demonstrate a case study on MDR evolution in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, providing links to some approaches for implementation.</description>

      <title>Multi Modal Information Fusion of Acoustic and Linguistic Data for Decoding Dairy Cow Vocalizations in Animal Welfare Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding animal vocalizations through multi-source data fusion is crucial for assessing emotional states and enhancing animal welfare in precision livestock farming. This study aims to decode dairy cow contact calls by employing multi-modal data fusion techniques, integrating transcription, semantic analysis, contextual and emotional assessment, and acoustic feature extraction. We utilized the Natural Language Processing model to transcribe audio recordings of cow vocalizations into written form. By fusing multiple acoustic features frequency, duration, and intensity with transcribed textual data, we developed a comprehensive representation of cow vocalizations. Utilizing data fusion within a custom-developed ontology, we categorized vocalizations into high frequency calls associated with distress or arousal, and low frequency calls linked to contentment or calmness. Analyzing the fused multi dimensional data, we identified anxiety related features indicative of emotional distress, including specific frequency measurements and sound spectrum results. Assessing the sentiment and acoustic features of vocalizations from 20 individual cows allowed us to determine differences in calling patterns and emotional states. Employing advanced machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Recurrent Neural Networks, we effectively processed and fused multi-source data to classify cow vocalizations. These models were optimized to handle computational demands and data quality challenges inherent in practical farm environments. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-source data fusion and intelligent processing techniques in animal welfare monitoring. This study represents a significant advancement in animal welfare assessment, highlighting the role of innovative fusion technologies in understanding and improving the emotional wellbeing of dairy cows.</description>

      <title>Segmentation algorithms and modeling of recurrent bursting events in neuronal and glial time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-time series of neuronal recordings are resulting from the activity of connected neuronal networks. Yet how neuronal properties can be extracted remains empirical. We review here the data analysis based on network models to recover physiological parameters from electrophysiological and calcium recordings in neurons and astrocytes. After, we present the recording techniques and activation events, such as burst and interburst and Up and Down states. We then describe time-serie segmentation methods developed to detect and to segment these events. To interpret the statistics extracted from time series, we present computational models of neuronal populations based on synaptic short-term plasticity and After hyperpolarization. We discuss how these models are calibrated so that they can reproduce the statistics observed in the experimental time series. They serve to extract specific parameters by comparing numerical and experimental statistical moment or entire distributions. Finally, we discus cases where calibrated models are used to predict the selective impact of some parameters on the circuit behavior, properties that would otherwise be difficult to dissect experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of classifying cell shapes from noisy contours, such as those obtained through cell instance segmentation of histological images. We assess the performance of various features for shape classification, including Elliptical Fourier Descriptors, curvature features, and lower dimensional representations. Using an annotated synthetic dataset of noisy contours, we identify the most suitable shape descriptors and apply them to a set of real images for qualitative analysis. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of descriptors for classifying cell shapes, which can support cell type identification and tissue characterization-critical tasks in both biological research and histopathological assessments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A consensus-based optimization (CBO) algorithm, which enables derivative and mesh-free optimization, is presented to localize a bioluminescent source. The light propagation is modeled by the radiative transfer equation approximated by spherical harmonics. The approach is investigated for a hierarchy of simplified diffusion models in simulated environments and tissue-mimicking phantoms. In simulations, the state-of-the-art diffusive approximation gives reliable results for heavily scattering media. However, higher-order models achieve better localization and more accurate source intensities for deeper sources and in the presence of artificial noise in strongly absorbing, but only moderately scattering media. In phantoms, higher-order models give lower approximation errors and the most accurate localization, even for a high scattering coefficient. These results demonstrate the potential of CBO to render higher-order models at lower computational cost while ensuring accurate localization in bioluminescence tomography.</description>

Abstract: Drug discovery typically consists of multiple steps, including identifying a target protein key to a disease's etiology, validating that interacting with this target could prevent symptoms or cure the disease, discovering a small molecule or biologic therapeutic to interact with it, and optimizing the candidate molecule through a complex landscape of required properties. Drug discovery related tasks often involve prediction and generation while considering multiple entities that potentially interact, which poses a challenge for typical AI models. For this purpose we present MAMMAL - Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language - a method that we applied to create a versatile multi-task multi-align foundation model that learns from large-scale biological datasets (2 billion samples) across diverse modalities, including proteins, small molecules, and genes. We introduce a prompt syntax that supports a wide range of classification, regression, and generation tasks. It allows combining different modalities and entity types as inputs and/or outputs. Our model handles combinations of tokens and scalars and enables the generation of small molecules and proteins, property prediction, and transcriptomic lab test predictions. We evaluated the model on 11 diverse downstream tasks spanning different steps within a typical drug discovery pipeline, where it reaches new SOTA in 9 tasks and is comparable to SOTA in 2 tasks. This performance is achieved while using a unified architecture serving all tasks, in contrast to the original SOTA performance achieved using tailored architectures.

      <title>Med-Real2Sim: Non-Invasive Medical Digital Twins using Physics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-world physical phenomena that uses mathematical modeling to characterize and simulate its defining features. By constructing digital twins for disease processes, we can perform in-silico simulations that mimic patients' health conditions and counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical interventions in a virtual setting. This eliminates the need for invasive procedures or uncertain treatment decisions. In this paper, we propose a method to identify digital twin model parameters using only noninvasive patient health data. We approach the digital twin modeling as a composite inverse problem, and observe that its structure resembles pretraining and finetuning in self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging this, we introduce a physics-informed SSL algorithm that initially pretrains a neural network on the pretext task of learning a differentiable simulator of a physiological process. Subsequently, the model is trained to reconstruct physiological measurements from noninvasive modalities while being constrained by the physical equations learned in pretraining. We apply our method to identify digital twins of cardiac hemodynamics using noninvasive echocardiogram videos, and demonstrate its utility in unsupervised disease detection and in-silico clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Double-Ended Synthesis Planning with Goal-Constrained Bidirectional Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) algorithms have demonstrated expert-level abilities in planning retrosynthetic routes to molecules of low to moderate complexity. However, current search methods assume the sufficiency of reaching arbitrary building blocks, failing to address the common real-world constraint where using specific molecules is desired. To this end, we present a formulation of synthesis planning with starting material constraints. Under this formulation, we propose Double-Ended Synthesis Planning (DESP), a novel CASP algorithm under a bidirectional graph search scheme that interleaves expansions from the target and from the goal starting materials to ensure constraint satisfiability. The search algorithm is guided by a goal-conditioned cost network learned offline from a partially observed hypergraph of valid chemical reactions. We demonstrate the utility of DESP in improving solve rates and reducing the number of search expansions by biasing synthesis planning towards expert goals on multiple new benchmarks. DESP can make use of existing one-step retrosynthesis models, and we anticipate its performance to scale as these one-step model capabilities improve.</description>

Abstract: Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and lithium-responsive headaches. They have recently gathered attention due to their potential preventive effect in viral infections. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade in the late 1940s, its underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. Lithium exposure is associated with a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression. Opposite to acute exposure, this metabolic response alleviates excessive cellular activity.
  The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability. This review investigates how lithium ions affect lipid membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. Ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.</description>

      <title>LLMs are Highly-Constrained Biophysical Sequence Optimizers</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown significant potential in various biological tasks such as protein engineering and molecule design. These tasks typically involve black-box discrete sequence optimization, where the challenge lies in generating sequences that are not only biologically feasible but also adhere to hard fine-grained constraints. However, LLMs often struggle with such constraints, especially in biological contexts where verifying candidate solutions is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing LLMs as highly-constrained bilevel optimizers through a methodology we refer to as Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation (LLOME). This approach combines both offline and online optimization, utilizing limited oracle evaluations to iteratively enhance the sequences generated by the LLM. We additionally propose a novel training objective -- Margin-Aligned Expectation (MargE) -- that trains the LLM to smoothly interpolate between the reward and reference distributions. Lastly, we introduce a synthetic test suite that bears strong geometric similarity to real biophysical problems and enables rapid evaluation of LLM optimizers without time-consuming lab validation. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to genetic algorithm baselines, LLMs achieve significantly lower regret solutions while requiring fewer test function evaluations. However, we also observe that LLMs exhibit moderate miscalibration, are susceptible to generator collapse, and have difficulty finding the optimal solution when no explicit ground truth rewards are available.</description>
