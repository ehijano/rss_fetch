      <title>Exploring Students perceptions of their learning experience and self efficacy in physics online class with project based learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Project Based Learning (PBL), recognized as an active learning strategy, has been linked to self efficacy of student in prior studies, including those within Physics Education Research. Meanwhile, technological advancements have significantly facilitated the optimization of diverse learning modes, including online learning. However, comprehensive investigations addressing questions such as how students perceive PBL and their self efficacy, what forms of PBL design they prefer, and what benefits and challenges they encounter during its implementation remain underexplored in existing literature. This study sought to uncover the experiences of ten students through longitudinal observation in an online PBL Physics class, focusing on its influence on their self efficacy within a phenomenological study. Data were collected via semi structured, in depth interviews. Social Cognitive Theory, Self Efficacy theory of Bandura, and theoretical framework for the impact of project based learning on educational outcomes were employed as guiding frameworks to shape the interpretation of students experiences and perspectives. Through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), the researchers identified four primary themes representing the experience of students. There are, variety of unique learning experiences based on students perceptions about their character, pivotal experience as a catalyst in the learning process, student self efficacy in Project Based Learning, and self reflection based on prior experience. The findings contribute novel insights for educators in implementing PBL, particularly in online contexts, by highlighting strategies to accommodate diverse student personality characteristics. Moreover, the study provides helpful references for longitudinal research on the interplay between PBL and self efficacy.</description>

      <title>Complex networks map test anxiety and wellbeing levels in students and ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Academic STEM evaluation can elicit anxiety, yet routine grading rarely captures how students semantically frame exams and wellbeing. We reconstruct these framings using behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMNs), that is, feature-rich networks of concepts linked by memory recalls and enriched with affective ratings and concreteness norms. We build BFMNs from 994 participants spanning STEM experts (N1 = 59), Italian high-schoolers (N2 = 206), physics undergraduates (N3 = 10), psychology undergraduates with math-anxiety levels (N4 = 301), and simulated students (N5 = 497) personified by a large language model (GPT-OSS 20B). Across all human groups, the concepts "exam" and "grade" were (i) perceived negatively, (ii) connected primarily to negatively valenced memory recalls, indicating a clustering of negative emotions around assessment, and (iii) framed through concepts eliciting fear and anticipation in most groups, including physics undergraduates (z-scores in the range [2.04, 2.53]). The semantic neighbourhoods of "anxiety" and "exam" overlapped three times more in human students than in GPT-based simulations, providing structural evidence of test anxiety in student populations. By contrast, experts displayed a neutral and more concrete network neighbourhood for "exam" (z = 1.87), with no clear trace of test anxiety. These negative assessment framings coexisted with positive representations of "wellbeing", which were rich in concrete associations in humans but linked to more abstract concepts in GPT digital twins. Overall, our results show that BFMNs offer a quantitative and interpretable framework to study academic anxiety and to distinguish human affective framing from current AI-based simulations</description>

      <title>Quantum three-body problem for nuclear physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A brief excursion into the three-body problem in quantum mechanics is presented for graduate students or researchers in nuclear physics. Starting from single-particle coordinates, the three-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation is systematically transformed into a representation in Jacobi coordinates. Gradient, Laplacian, and kinetic energy operators are explicitly derived using the multivariable chain rule. Faddeev equations are reformulated in hyperspherical coordinates. In all transformations (from single-particle coordinates to Jacobi coordinates, rotation between Jacobi coordinates and from Jacobi coordinates to hyperspherical coordinates) the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is computed to ensure correct transformation of volume elements. The Faddeev equations in hyperspherical coordinates are projected onto a hyperspherical harmonics basis, leading to the coupled hyperradial equations that define the hyperspherical harmonics method.</description>
