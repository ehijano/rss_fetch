      <title>Stabilization of isogeometric finite element method with optimal test functions computed from $L_2$ norm residual minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare several stabilization methods in the context of isogeometric analysis and B-spline basis functions, using an advection-dominated advection\revision{-}diffusion as a model problem. We derive (1) the least-squares finite element method formulation using the framework of Petrov-Galerkin method with optimal test functions in the $L_2$ norm, which guarantee automatic preservation of the \emph{inf-sup} condition of the continuous formulation. We also combine it with the standard Galerkin method to recover (2) the Galerkin/least-squares formulation, and derive coercivity constant bounds valid for B-spline basis functions. The resulting stabilization method are compared with the least-squares and (3) the Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG)method using again the Eriksson-Johnson model problem. The results indicate that least-squares (equivalent to Petrov-Galerkin with $L_2$-optimal test functions) outperforms the other stabilization methods for small P\'eclet numbers, while strongly advection-dominated problems are better handled with SUPG or Galerkin/least-squares.</description>

      <title>On Two Conservative HDG Schemes for Nonlinear Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method is proposed and analyzed for the Klein-Gordon equation with local Lipschitz-type non-linearity. {\it A priori} error estimates are derived, and it is proved that approximations of the flux and the displacement converge with order $O(h^{k+1}),$ where $h$ is the discretizing parameter and $k$ is the degree of the piecewise polynomials to approximate both flux and displacement variables. After post-processing of the semi-discrete solution, it is shown that the post-processed solution converges with order $O(h^{k+2})$ for $k \geq 1.$ Moreover, a second-order conservative finite difference scheme is applied to discretize in time %second-order convergence in time. and it is proved that the discrete energy is conserved with optimal error estimates for the completely discrete method. %Since at each time step, one has to solve a nonlinear system of algebraic equations, To avoid solving a nonlinear system of algebraic equations at each time step, a non-conservative scheme is proposed, and its error analysis is also briefly established. Moreover, another variant of the HDG scheme is analyzed, and error estimates are established. Finally, some numerical experiments are conducted to confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Solving Multi-Group Neutron Diffusion Eigenvalue Problem with Decoupling Residual Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the midst of the neural network's success in solving partial differential equations, tackling eigenvalue problems using neural networks remains a challenging task. However, the Physics Constrained-General Inverse Power Method Neural Network (PC-GIPMNN) approach was proposed and successfully applied to solve the single-group critical problems in reactor physics. This paper aims to solve critical problems in multi-group scenarios and in more complex geometries. Hence, inspired by the merits of traditional source iterative method, which can overcome the ill-condition of the right side of the equations effectively and solve the multi-group problem effectively, we propose two residual loss function called Decoupling Residual loss function and Direct Iterative loss function. Our loss function can deal with multi-group eigenvalue problem, and also single-group eigenvalue problem. Using the new residual loss functions, our study solves one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional multi-group problems in nuclear reactor physics without prior data. In numerical experiments, our approach demonstrates superior generalization capabilities compared to previous work.</description>

      <title>Approximate peak time to time-domain fluorescence diffuse optical tomography for nonzero fluorescence lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns an inverse problem for fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT) reconstructing locations of multiple point targets from the measured temporal response functions. The targets are multiple fluorescent point objects with a nonzero fluorescence lifetime at unknown locations. Peak time, when the temporal response function of the fluorescence reaches its maximum, is a robust parameter of the temporal response function in FDOT because it is most less suffered by the artifacts, such as noise, and is easily determined by experiments. We derive an approximate peak time equation based on asymptotic analysis in an explicit way in the case of nonzero fluorescence lifetime when there are single and multiple point targets. The performance of the approximation is numerically verified. Then, we develop a bisection algorithm to reconstruct the location of a single point target from the algorithm proposed in [4] for the case of zero fluorescence lifetime. Moreover, we propose a boundary-scan algorithm for the reconstruction of locations of multiple point targets. Finally, several numerical experiments are implemented to show the efficiency and robustness of the addressed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence in finite element fully discrete error analysis and a novel fast solver for the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of a backward Euler finite element discretization applied to a multi-domain and multi-scale elliptic-parabolic system, derived from the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model for lithium-ion batteries. Our analysis establishes optimal-order error estimates for variables in the norms $l^2(H^1)$ and $l^2(L^2(H^q_r))$, $q=0,1$. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a novel scale-decoupled solver that balances rapid convergence with reduced memory requirements. Numerical experiments using realistic battery parameters validate the theoretical error rates and highlight the superior performance of the proposed solver compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a FieldTNN-based machine learning method for solving the Maxwell eigenvalue problem in both 2D and 3D domains, including both tensor and non-tensor computational regions. First, we extend the existing TNN-based approach to address the Maxwell eigenvalue problem, a fundamental challenge in electromagnetic field theory. Second, we tackle non-tensor computational domains, which represents a novel and significant contribution of this work. Third, we incorporate the divergence-free condition into the optimization process, allowing for the automatic filtering of spurious eigenpairs. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm, underscoring its potential for broader applications in computational electromagnetics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Lagrangian functions for a class of second-order differential systems arising from physics. For such systems, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Lagrangian functions. Based on the variational principle and the splitting technique, we construct variational integrators and prove their equivalence to the composition of explicit symplectic methods. We apply the newly derived variational integrators to the Kepler problem and demonstrate their effectiveness in numerical simulations. Moreover, using the modified Lagrangian, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the numerical solutions in preserving the Laplace--Runge--Lenz (LRL) vector.</description>

      <title>A block-acoustic preconditioner for the elastic Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel block-preconditioner for the elastic Helmholtz equation, based on a reduction to acoustic Helmholtz equations. Both versions of the Helmholtz equations are challenging numerically. The elastic Helmholtz equation is larger, as a system of PDEs, and harder to solve due to its more complicated physics. It was recently suggested that the elastic Helmholtz equation can be reformulated as a generalized saddle-point system, opening the door to the current development. Utilizing the approximate commutativity of the underlying differential operators, we suggest a block-triangular preconditioner whose diagonal blocks are acoustic Helmholtz operators. Thus, we enable the solution of the elastic version using virtually any existing solver for the acoustic version as a black-box. We prove a sufficient condition for the convergence of our method, that sheds light on the long questioned role of the commutator in the convergence of approximate commutator preconditioners. We show scalability of our preconditioner with respect to the Poisson ratio and with respect to the grid size. We compare our approach, combined with multigrid solve of each block, to a recent monolithic multigrid method for the elastic Helmholtz equation. The block-acoustic multigrid achieves a lower computational cost for various heterogeneous media, and a significantly lower memory consumption, compared to the monolithic approach. It results in a fast solution method for wave propagation problems in challenging heterogeneous media in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of path sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the Euler-Maruyama discretisation of an autonomous SDE using a uniform timestep $h$ has a strong convergence error which is $O(h^{1/2})$ when the drift and diffusion are both globally Lipschitz. This note proves that the same is true for the approximation of the path sensitivity to changes in a parameter affecting the drift and diffusion, assuming the appropriate number of derivatives exist and are bounded. This seems to fill a gap in the existing stochastic numerical analysis literature.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory dynamical low-rank approximation for the 3+3d Boltzmann-BGK equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two novel interpolatory dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation methods for the efficient time integration of the Boltzmann-BGK equation. Both methods overcome limitations of classic DLR schemes based on orthogonal projections for nonlinear equations. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed methods can efficiently compute solutions to the full Boltzmann-BGK equation without restricting to e.g. weakly compressible or isothermal flow. The first method we propose directly applies the recently developed interpolatory projector-splitting scheme on low-rank matrix manifolds. The second method is a variant of the rank-adaptive basis update and Galerkin scheme, where the Galerkin step is replaced by a collocation step, resulting in a new scheme we call basis update and collocate (BUC). Numerical experiments in both fluid and kinetic regimes demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods. In particular we demonstrate that the methods can be used to efficiently compute low-rank solutions in the six-dimensional (three spatial and three velocity dimensions) setting on a standard laptop.</description>

      <title>A priori and a posteriori error estimates of a really pressure-robust virtual element method for the incompressible Brinkman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents both a priori and a posteriori error analyses for a really pressure-robust virtual element method to approximate the incompressible Brinkman problem. We construct a divergence-preserving reconstruction operator using the Raviart-Thomas element for the discretization on the right-hand side. The optimal priori error estimates are carried out, which imply the velocity error in the energy norm is independent of both the continuous pressure and the viscosity. Taking advantage of the virtual element method's ability to handle more general polygonal meshes, we implement effective mesh refinement strategies and develop a residual-type a posteriori error estimator. This estimator is proven to provide global upper and local lower bounds for the discretization error. Finally, some numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, reliability and efficiency of the method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the variable-exponent Abel kernel and demonstrate its multiscale nature in modeling crossover dynamics from the initial quasi-exponential behavior to long-term power-law behavior. Then we apply this to an integro-differential equation modeling, e.g. mechanical vibration of viscoelastic materials with changing material properties. We apply the Crank-Nicolson method and the linear interpolation quadrature to design a temporal second-order scheme, and develop a framework of exponentially weighted energy argument in error estimate to account for the non-positivity and non-monotonicity of the multiscale kernel. Numerical experiments are carried out to substantiate the theoretical findings and the crossover dynamics of the model.</description>

      <title>Explainable MST-ECoGNet Decode Visual Information from ECoG Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the application of brain-computer interface (BCI), we not only need to accurately decode brain signals,but also need to consider the explainability of the decoding process, which is related to the reliability of the model. In the process of designing a decoder or processing brain signals, we need to explain the discovered phenomena in physical or physiological way. An explainable model not only makes the signal processing process clearer and improves reliability, but also allows us to better understand brain activities and facilitate further exploration of the brain. In this paper, we systematically analyze the multi-classification dataset of visual brain signals ECoG, using a simple and highly explainable method to explore the ways in which ECoG carry visual information, then based on these findings, we propose a model called MST-ECoGNet that combines traditional mathematics and deep learning. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) found that ECoG time-frequency domain information carries visual information, provides important features for visual classification tasks. The mathematical method of MST (Modified S Transform) can effectively extract temporal-frequency domain information; 2) The spatial domain of ECoG signals also carries visual information, the unique spatial features are also important features for classification tasks; 3) The real and imaginary information in the time-frequency domain are complementary. The effective combination of the two is more helpful for classification tasks than using amplitude information alone; 4) Finally, compared with previous work, our model is smaller and has higher performance: for the object MonJ, the model size is reduced to 10.82% of base model, the accuracy is improved by 6.63%; for the object MonC, the model size is reduced to 8.78%, the accuracy is improved by 16.63%.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of the Successive Projection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successive projection algorithm (SPA) is a workhorse algorithm to learn the $r$ vertices of the convex hull of a set of $(r-1)$-dimensional data points, a.k.a. a latent simplex, which has numerous applications in data science. In this paper, we revisit the robustness to noise of SPA and several of its variants. In particular, when $r \geq 3$, we prove the tightness of the existing error bounds for SPA and for two more robust preconditioned variants of SPA. We also provide significantly improved error bounds for SPA, by a factor proportional to the conditioning of the $r$ vertices, in two special cases: for the first extracted vertex, and when $r \leq 2$. We then provide further improvements for the error bounds of a translated version of SPA proposed by Arora et al. (''A practical algorithm for topic modeling with provable guarantees'', ICML, 2013) in two special cases: for the first two extracted vertices, and when $r \leq 3$. Finally, we propose a new more robust variant of SPA that first shifts and lifts the data points in order to minimize the conditioning of the problem. We illustrate our results on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>An exponential-free Runge--Kutta framework for developing third-order unconditionally energy stable schemes for the Cahn--Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a class of up to third-order energy-stable schemes for the Cahn--Hilliard equation. Building on Lawson's integrating factor Runge--Kutta method, which is widely used for stiff semilinear equations, we discuss its limitations, such as the inability to preserve the equilibrium state and the oversmoothing of interfacial layers in the solution's profile because of the exponential damping effects. To overcome this drawback, we approximate the exponential term using a class of sophisticated Taylor polynomials, leading to a novel Runge--Kutta framework called exponential-free Runge--Kutta. By incorporating stabilization techniques, we analyze the energy stability of the proposed schemes and demonstrate that they preserve the original energy dissipation without time-step restrictions. Furthermore, we perform an analysis of the linear stability and establish an error estimate in the $\ell^2$ norm. A series of numerical experiments validate the high-order accuracy, mass conservation, and energy dissipation of our schemes.</description>

      <title>Max-Normalized Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform for Limited Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT) exploits one-dimensional Wasserstein transport and the Radon transform to represent prominent features in images. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. The aim of this paper is to make the R-CDT and the related sliced Wasserstein distance invariant under affine transformations. For this, we propose a two-step normalization of the R-CDT and prove that our novel transform allows linear separation of affinely transformed image classes. The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments showing a significant increase of the classification accuracy compared to the original R-CDT.</description>

      <title>Parameter Error Analysis for the 3D Modified Leray-alpha Model: Analytical and Numerical Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a parameter error analysis for the 3D modified Leray-$\alpha$ model using both analytical and numerical approaches. We first prove the global well-posedness and continuous dependence of initial data for the assimilated system. Furthermore, given sufficient conditions on the physical parameters and norms of the true solution, we demonstrate that the true solution can be recovered from the approximation solution, with an error determined by the discrepancy between the true and approximating parameters. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the convergence criteria.</description>

      <title>Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Method Based on Flux Vector Splitting with Constrained Optimization-based TVB(D)-minmod Limiter for Solving Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16367v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flux vector splitting (FVS) method has firstly been incorporated into the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework for reconstructing the numerical fluxes required for the spatial semi-discrete formulation, setting it apart from the conventional DG approaches that typically utilize the Lax-Friedrichs flux scheme or classical Riemann solvers. The control equations of hyperbolic conservation systems are initially reformulated into a flux-split form. Subsequently, a variational approach is applied to this flux-split form, from which a DG spatial semi-discrete scheme based on FVS is derived. In order to suppress numerical pseudo-oscillations, the smoothness measurement function IS from the WENO limiter is integrated into the TVB(D)-minmod limiter, constructing an optimization problem based on the smoothness factor constraint, thereby realizing a TVB(D)-minmod limiter applicable to arbitrary high-order polynomial approximation. Subsequently, drawing on the ``reconstructed polynomial and the original high-order scheme's L2 -error constraint'' from the literature [1] , combined with our smoothness factor constraint, a bi-objective optimization problem is formulated to enable the TVB(D)-minmod limiter to balance oscillation suppression and high precision. As for hyperbolic conservation systems, limiters are typically required to be used in conjunction with local characteristic decomposition. To transform polynomials from the physical space to the characteristic space, an interpolation-based characteristic transformation scheme has been proposed, and its equivalence with the original moment characteristic transformation has been demonstrated in one-dimensional scenarios. Finally, the concept of ``flux vector splitting based on Jacobian eigenvalue decomposition'' has been applied to the conservative linear scalar transport equations and the nonlinear Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>A stiffly stable semi-discrete scheme for the damped wave equation on the half-line using SBP and SAT techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability of both the semi-discrete and the implicit central scheme for the linear damped wave equation on the half-line, where the spatial boundary is characteristic for the limiting equation. The proposed schemes incorporate a discrete boundary condition designed to guarantee the uniform stability of the IBVP, regardless of the stiffness of the source term or the spatial step size. Stability estimates for the semi-discrete scheme are established using the summation-by-parts (SBP) and simultaneous-approximation-term (SAT) penalty techniques, building on the continuous framework analyzed by Xin and Xu (2000).</description>

      <title>A Novel Methodology for Modelling First and Second Order Phase Transformations -- Thermodynamic Aspects, Variational Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for the mathematical modelling of first and second order phase transformations. It will be shown that this methodology can be related to certain limiting cases of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, specifically the cases of having (i) a convex molar free energy function and (ii) a convex molar free energy function with no regularization. The latter case is commonly regarded as unstable; however, by modifying the variational approach and solving for rate-dependent variables, we obtain a stabilized method capable of handling the missing regularization. While the specific numerical method used to solve the equations (a mixed finite element approach) has been previously employed in related contexts (e.g., to stabilize solutions of the Laplace equation), its application to diffusion and diffusional phase transformations is novel. We prove the thermodynamic consistency of the derived method and discuss several use cases. Our work contributes to the development of new mathematical tools for modeling complex phase transformations in materials science.</description>

      <title>Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequalities for scattered data on polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of scattered points on a regular or irregular 2D polygon, we aim to employ them as quadrature points to construct a quadrature rule that establishes Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund inequalities on this polygon. The quadrature construction is aided by Bernstein--B\'{e}zier polynomials. For this purpose, we first propose a quadrature rule on triangles with an arbitrary degree of exactness and establish Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund estimates for 3-, 10-, and 21-point quadrature rules on triangles. Based on the 3-point quadrature rule on triangles, we then propose the desired quadrature rule on the polygon that satisfies Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund inequalities for $1\leq p \leq \infty$. As a byproduct, we provide error analysis for both quadrature rules on triangles and polygons. Numerical results further validate our construction.</description>

      <title>Sequential data assimilation for PDEs using shape-morphing solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape-morphing solutions (also known as evolutional deep neural networks, reduced-order nonlinear solutions, and neural Galerkin schemes) are a new class of methods for approximating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we introduce a sequential data assimilation method for incorporating observational data in a shape-morphing solution (SMS). Our method takes the form of a predictor-corrector scheme, where the observations are used to correct the SMS parameters using Newton-like iterations. Between observation points, the SMS equations (a set of ordinary differential equations) are used to evolve the solution forward in time. We prove that, under certain conditions, the data assimilated SMS (DA-SMS) converges uniformly towards the true state of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of DA-SMS on three examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Our numerical results suggest that DA-SMS converges with relatively sparse observations and a single iteration of the Newton-like method.</description>

      <title>On a Completely Discrete Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Incompressible Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a fully discrete numerical scheme for the incompressible Chemotaxis(Keller-Segel)-Navier-Stokes system. Based on a discontinuous Galerkin finite element scheme in the spatial directions, a semi-implicit first-order finite difference method in the temporal direction is applied to derive a completely discrete scheme. With the help of a new projection, optimal error estimates in $L^2$ and $H^1$-norms for the cell density, the concentration of chemical substances and the fluid velocity are derived. Further, optimal error bound in $L^2$-norm for the fluid pressure is obtained. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed, whose results confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Sampling with Adaptive Variance for Multimodal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a class of adaptive sampling algorithms for multimodal distributions on a bounded domain, which share a structural resemblance to the classic overdamped Langevin dynamics. We first demonstrate that this class of linear dynamics with adaptive diffusion coefficients and vector fields can be interpreted and analyzed as weighted Wasserstein gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between the current distribution and the target Gibbs distribution, which directly leads to the exponential convergence of both the KL and $\chi^2$ divergences, with rates depending on the weighted Wasserstein metric and the Gibbs potential. We then show that a derivative-free version of the dynamics can be used for sampling without gradient information of the Gibbs potential and that for Gibbs distributions with nonconvex potentials, this approach could achieve significantly faster convergence than the classical overdamped Langevin dynamics. A comparison of the mean transition times between local minima of a nonconvex potential further highlights the better efficiency of the derivative-free dynamics in sampling.</description>

      <title>Galerkin Formulation of Path Integrals in Lattice Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for Galerkin formulations of path integrals in lattice field theory. The framework is based on using the degrees of freedom associated to a Galerkin discretization as the fundamental lattice variables. We formulate standard concepts in lattice field theory, such as the partition function and correlation functions, in terms of the degrees of freedom. For example, using continuous finite element spaces, we show that the two-point spatial correlation function can be defined between any two points on the domain (as opposed to at just lattice sites) and furthermore, that this satisfies a weak propagator (or Green's function) identity, in analogy to the continuum case. Furthermore, this framework leads naturally to higher-order formulations of lattice field theories by considering higher-order finite element spaces for the Galerkin discretization. We consider analytical and numerical examples of scalar field theory to investigate how increasing the order of piecewise polynomial finite element spaces affect the approximation of lattice observables. Finally, we sketch an outline of this Galerkin framework in the context of gauge field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work derives extremal tail bounds for the Gaussian trace estimator applied to a real symmetric matrix. We define a partial ordering on the eigenvalues, so that when a matrix has greater spectrum under this ordering, its estimator will have worse tail bounds. This is done for two families of matrices: positive semidefinite matrices with bounded effective rank, and indefinite matrices with bounded 2-norm and fixed Frobenius norm. In each case, the tail region is defined rigorously and is constant for a given family.</description>

      <title>VICON: Vision In-Context Operator Networks for Multi-Physics Fluid Dynamics Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) are models that learn operators across different types of PDEs using a few-shot, in-context approach. Although they show successful generalization to various PDEs, existing methods treat each data point as a single token, and suffer from computational inefficiency when processing dense data, limiting their application in higher spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), incorporating a vision transformer architecture that efficiently processes 2D functions through patch-wise operations. We evaluated our method on three fluid dynamics datasets, demonstrating both superior performance (reducing scaled $L^2$ error by $40\%$ and $61.6\%$ for two benchmark datasets for compressible flows, respectively) and computational efficiency (requiring only one-third of the inference time per frame) in long-term rollout predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model with fixed timestep prediction: Multiple Physics Pretraining (MPP). Compared to MPP, our method preserves the benefits of in-context operator learning, enabling flexible context formation when dealing with insufficient frame counts or varying timestep values.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the effect of macro control measures on epidemics transport via a coupled PDE crowd flow - epidemics spreading dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to provide an approach to the macroscopic modeling and simulation of pedestrian flow, coupled with contagion spreading, towards numerical investigation of the effect of certain, macro-control measures on epidemics transport dynamics. To model the dynamics of the pedestrians, a second-order macroscopic model, coupled with an Eikonal equation, is used. This model is coupled with a macroscopic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Susceptible-Vaccinated (SEISV) contagion model, where the force-of-infection $\beta$ coefficient is modeled via a drift-diffusion equation, which is affected by the air-flow dynamics due to the ventilation. The air-flow dynamics are obtained assuming a potential flow that can imitate the existence of ventilation in the computational domain. Numerical approximations are considered for the coupled model along with numerical tests and results. In particular, we investigate the effect of employment of different, epidemics transport control measures, which may be implemented through real-time manipulation of i) ventilation rate and direction, ii) maximum speed of pedestrians, and iii) average distances between pedestrians, and through iv) incorporation in the crowd of masked or vaccinated individuals. Such simulations of disease spreading in a moving crowd can potentially provide valuable information about the risks of infection in relevant situations and support the design of systematic intervention/control measures.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear quantum computing by amplified encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for high-dimensional nonlinear quantum computation that exploits tensor products of amplified vector and matrix encodings to efficiently evaluate multivariate polynomials. The approach enables the solution of nonlinear equations by quantum implementations of the fixed-point iteration and Newton's method, with quantitative runtime bounds derived in terms of the error tolerance. These results show that a quantum advantage, characterized by a logarithmic scaling of complexity with the dimension of the problem, is preserved. While Newton's method achieves near-optimal theoretical complexity, the fixed-point iteration already shows practical feasibility, as demonstrated by numerical experiments solving simple nonlinear problems on existing quantum devices. By bridging theoretical advances with practical implementation, the framework of amplified encodings offers a new path to nonlinear quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Perfusion Reconstruction with Time Separation Technique in Cone-Beam CT Dynamic Liver Perfusion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of embolisation, a minimally invasive treatment of liver cancer, could be evaluated in the operational room with cone-beam CT by acquiring a dynamic perfusion scan. The reconstruction algorithm must address the issues of low temporal sampling and higher noise levels inherent in cone-beam CT systems, compared to conventional CT. Therefore, a model-based perfusion reconstruction based on the time separation technique (TST) was applied. TST uses basis functions to model time attenuation curves. These functions are either analytical or based on prior knowledge, extracted using singular value decomposition from CT perfusion data. To explore how well the prior knowledge can model perfusion dynamics and what the potential limitations are, the dynamic CBCT perfusion scan was simulated under different noise levels. The TST method was compared to static reconstruction. It was demonstrated that a set consisting of only four basis functions results in perfusion maps that preserve relevant information, denoises the data, and outperforms static reconstruction under higher noise levels. TST with prior knowledge would not only outperform static reconstruction, but also the TST with analytical basis functions. Furthermore, it has been shown that only eight CBCT rotations, unlike previously assumed ten, are sufficient to obtain the perfusion maps comparable to the reference CT perfusion maps. This contributes to saving dose and reconstruction time. The real dynamic CBCT perfusion scan, reconstructed under the same conditions as the simulated scan, shows potential for maintaining the accuracy of the perfusion maps. By visual inspection, the embolised region was matching to that in corresponding CT perfusion maps. Further analysis of a larger cohort of patient data is needed to draw final conclusions regarding the expected advantages of the time separation technique.</description>

      <title>Deriving Analytical Solutions Using Symbolic Matrix Structural Analysis: Part 2 -- Plane Trusses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study extends the use of symbolic computation in Matrix Structural Analysis (MSA) to plane (2D) trusses, building on previous work that focused on continuous beams. An open-source MATLAB program, hosted on GitHub, was developed to perform symbolic analysis of 2D trusses under point loads for any configuration. Using MATLAB's Symbolic Math Toolbox, the program derives analytical expressions for displacements, support reactions, and axial forces, providing a deeper understanding of truss behavior. The symbolic approach also supports efficient and scalable sensitivity analysis by directly computing partial derivatives of outputs with respect to input parameters, enhancing design exploration and optimization. This tool serves as a valuable resource for both engineering practice and education, offering clear insights into parameter relationships and enriching the understanding of structural mechanics. The accuracy of the symbolic results has been rigorously validated against two commercial finite element software programs and results from the literature, with full agreement, confirming the validity and generality of the methodology.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference compatible entropy-conserving schemes for the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a family of entropy-conserving finite-difference discretizations for the compressible flow equations. In addition to conserving the primary quantities of mass, momentum, and total energy, the methods also preserve kinetic energy and pressure equilibrium. The schemes are based on finite-difference (FD) representations of the logarithmic mean, establishing and leveraging a broader link between linear and nonlinear two-point averages and FD forms. The schemes are locally conservative due to the summation-by-parts property and therefore admit a local flux form, making them applicable also in finite-volume and finite-element settings. The effectiveness of these schemes is validated through various test cases (1D Sod shock tube, 1D density wave, 2D isentropic vortex, 3D Taylor Green vortex) that demonstrate exact conservation of entropy along with conservation of the primary quantities and preservation of pressure equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Priors for Boundary Value Problems of Linear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental task in computational science, traditionally addressed by numerical solvers. Recent advancements have introduced neural operators and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle PDEs, achieving reduced computational costs at the expense of solution quality and accuracy. Gaussian processes (GPs) have also been applied to linear PDEs, with the advantage of always yielding precise solutions. In this work, we propose Boundary Ehrenpreis-Palamodov Gaussian Processes (B-EPGPs), a novel framework for constructing GP priors that satisfy both general systems of linear PDEs with constant coefficients and linear boundary conditions. We explicitly construct GP priors for representative PDE systems with practical boundary conditions. Formal proofs of correctness are provided and empirical results demonstrating significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art neural operator approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.04161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to develop a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for the indefinite time-harmonic Maxwell equations with the perfectly conducting boundary in the three-dimensional space. First, we derive the wavenumber explicit regularity result, which plays an important role in the error analysis for the HDG method. Second, we prove a discrete inf-sup condition which holds for all positive mesh size $h$, for all wavenumber $k$, and for general domain $\Omega$. Then, we establish the optimal order error estimates of the underlying HDG method with constant independent of the wavenumber. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Phase-space iterative solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an iterative method to solve problems in small-strain non-linear elasticity, termed ``Phase-Space Iterations'' (PSIs). The method is inspired by recent work in data-driven computational mechanics, which reformulated the classic boundary value problem of continuum mechanics using the concept of ''phase space'' associated with a mesh. The latter is an abstract metric space, whose coordinates are indexed by strains and stress components, where each possible state of the discretized body corresponds to a point. Two subsets are then defined: an affine space termed ``physically-admissible set'' made up by those points that satisfy equilibrium and a ``materially-admissible set'' containing points that satisfy the constitutive law. Solving the boundary-value problem amounts to finding the intersection between these two subdomains. In the linear-elastic setting, this can be achieved through the solution of a set of linear equations; when material non-linearity enters the picture, such is not the case anymore and iterative solution approaches are necessary. Our iterative method consists on projecting points alternatively from one set to the other, until convergence. To evaluate the performance of the method, we draw inspiration from the ''method of alternative projections'' and the ''method of projections onto convex sets'', both of which have a robust mathematical foundation in terms of conditions for the existence of solutions and guarantees convergence. This foundation is leveraged to analyze the simplest case and to establish a geometric convergence rate. We also present a realistic case to illustrate PSIs' strengths when compared to the classic Newton-Raphson method, the usual tool of choice in non-linear continuum mechanics. Finally, its aptitude to deal with constitutive laws based on neural network is also showcased.</description>

      <title>Fast and Inverse-Free Algorithms for Deflating Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a key question in numerical linear algebra: how can we compute projectors onto the deflating subspaces of a regular matrix pencil $(A,B)$, in particular without using matrix inversion or defaulting to an expensive Schur decomposition? We focus specifically on spectral projectors, whose associated deflating subspaces correspond to sets of eigenvalues/eigenvectors. In this work, we present a high-level approach to computing these projectors, which combines rational function approximation with an inverse-free arithmetic of Benner and Byers [Numerische Mathematik 2006]. The result is a numerical framework that captures existing inverse-free methods, generates an array of new options, and provides straightforward tools for pursuing efficiency on structured problems (e.g., definite pencils). To exhibit the efficacy of this framework, we consider a handful of methods in detail, including Implicit Repeated Squaring and iterations based on the matrix sign function. In an appendix, we demonstrate that recent, randomized divide-and-conquer eigensolvers -- which are built on fast methods for individual projectors like those considered in the rest of the paper -- can be adapted to produce the generalized Schur form of any matrix pencil in nearly matrix multiplication time.</description>

      <title>A semi-discrete Active Flux method for the Euler equations on Cartesian grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Flux is an extension of the Finite Volume method and additionally incorporates point values located at cell boundaries. This gives rise to a globally continuous approximation of the solution. Originally, the Active Flux method emerged as a fully discrete method, and required an exact or approximate evolution operator for the point value update. For nonlinear problems such an operator is often difficult to obtain, in particular for multiple spatial dimensions. We demonstrate that a new semi-discrete Active Flux method (first described in Abgrall&amp;Barsukow, 2023 for one space dimension) can be used to solve nonlinear hyperbolic systems in multiple dimensions without requiring evolution operators. We focus here on the compressible Euler equations of inviscid hydrodynamics and third-order accuracy. We introduce a multi-dimensional limiting strategy and demonstrate the performance of the new method on both Riemann problems and subsonic flows.</description>

      <title>Laplace-based strategies for Bayesian optimal experimental design with nuisance uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the optimal design of experiments in the Bayesian setting typically requires estimation and optimization of the expected information gain functional. This functional consists of one outer and one inner integral, separated by the logarithm function applied to the inner integral. When the mathematical model of the experiment contains uncertainty about the parameters of interest and nuisance uncertainty, (i.e., uncertainty about parameters that affect the model but are not themselves of interest to the experimenter), two inner integrals must be estimated. Thus, the already considerable computational effort required to determine good approximations of the expected information gain is increased further. The Laplace approximation has been applied successfully in the context of experimental design in various ways, and we propose two novel estimators featuring the Laplace approximation to alleviate the computational burden of both inner integrals considerably. The first estimator applies Laplace's method followed by a Laplace approximation, introducing a bias. The second estimator uses two Laplace approximations as importance sampling measures for Monte Carlo approximations of the inner integrals. Both estimators use Monte Carlo approximation for the remaining outer integral estimation. We provide four numerical examples demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of our proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>High-Order Integration on regular triangulated manifolds reaches Super-Algebraic Approximation Rates through Cubical Re-parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for deriving high-order volume elements (HOVE) designed for the integration of scalar functions over regular embedded manifolds. For constructing HOVE we introduce square-squeezing --a homeomorphic multilinear hypercube-simplex transformation reparametrizing an initial flat triangulation of the manifold to a cubical mesh. By employing square-squeezing, we approximate the integrand and the volume element for each hypercube domain of the reparameterized mesh through interpolation in Chebyshev-Lobatto grids. This strategy circumvents the Runge phenomenon, replacing the initial integral with a closed-form expression that can be precisely computed by high-order quadratures.
  We prove novel bounds of the integration error in terms of the $r^\text{th}$-order total variation of the integrand and the surface parameterization, predicting high algebraic approximation rates that scale solely with the interpolation degree and not, as is common, with the average simplex size. For smooth integrals whose total variation is constantly bounded with increasing $r$, the estimates prove the integration error to decrease even exponentially, while mesh refinements are limited to achieve algebraic rates. The resulting approximation power is demonstrated in several numerical experiments, particularly showcasing $p$-refinements to overcome the limitations of $h$-refinements for highly varying smooth integrals.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we analyze a space-time unfitted finite element method for the discretization of scalar surface partial differential equations on evolving surfaces. For higher order approximations of the evolving surface we use the technique of (iso)parametric mappings for which a level set representation of the evolving surface is essential. We derive basic results in which certain geometric characteristics of the exact space-time surface are related to corresponding ones of the numerical surface approximation. These results are used in an error analysis of a higher order space-time TraceFEM.</description>

      <title>Conjugate Direction Methods Under Inconsistent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the development of the conjugate gradient (CG) method in 1952 by Hestenes and Stiefel, CG, has become an indispensable tool in computational mathematics for solving positive definite linear systems. On the other hand, the conjugate residual (CR) method, closely related CG and introduced by Stiefel in 1955 for the same settings, remains relatively less known outside the numerical linear algebra community. Since their inception, these methods -- henceforth collectively referred to as conjugate direction methods -- have been extended beyond positive definite to indefinite, albeit consistent, settings. Going one step further, in this paper, we investigate the theoretical and empirical properties of these methods under inconsistent systems. Among other things, we show that small modifications to the original algorithms allow for the pseudo-inverse solution. Furthermore, we show that CR is essentially equivalent to the minimum residual method, proposed by Paige and Saunders in 1975, in such contexts. Lastly, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to shed lights on their numerical stability (or lack thereof) and their performance for inconsistent systems. Surprisingly, we will demonstrate that, unlike CR and contrary to popular belief, CG can exhibit significant numerical instability, bordering on catastrophe in some instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the nodal finite element approximation of peridynamics, in which the nodal displacements satisfy the peridynamics equation at each mesh node. For the nonlinear bond-based peridynamics model, it is shown that, under the suitable assumptions on an exact solution, the discretized solution associated with the central-in-time and nodal finite element discretization converges to the exact solution in $L^2$ norm at the rate $C_1 \Delta t + C_2 h^2/\epsilon^2$. Here, $\Delta t$, $h$, and $\epsilon$ are time step size, mesh size, and the size of the horizon or nonlocal length scale, respectively. Constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are independent of $h$ and $\Delta t$ and depend on norms of the solution and nonlocal length scale. Several numerical examples involving pre-crack, void, and notch are considered, and the efficacy of the proposed nodal finite element discretization is analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyse a novel third-order low-regularity trigonometric integrator for the semilinear Klein-Gordon equation with non-smooth solution in the $d$-dimensional space, where $d=1,2,3$. The integrator is constructed based on the full use of Duhamel's formula and the employment of a twisted function tailored for trigonometric integrals. Robust error analysis is conducted, demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves third-order accuracy in the energy space under a weak regularity requirement in $H^{1+\max(\mu,1)}(\mathbb{T}^d)\times H^{\max(\mu,1)}(\mathbb{T}^d)$ with $\mu&gt; \frac{d}{2}$. A numerical experiment shows that the proposed third-order low-regularity integrator is much more accurate than some well-known exponential integrators of order three for approximating the Klein-Gordon equation with non-smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>An Unstructured Mesh Reaction-Drift-Diffusion Master Equation with Reversible Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a convergent reaction-drift-diffusion master equation (CRDDME) to facilitate the study of reaction processes in which spatial transport is influenced by drift due to one-body potential fields within general domain geometries. The generalized CRDDME is obtained through two steps. We first derive an unstructured grid jump process approximation for reversible diffusions, enabling the simulation of drift-diffusion processes where the drift arises due to a conservative field that biases particle motion. Leveraging the Edge-Averaged Finite Element method, our approach preserves detailed balance of drift-diffusion fluxes at equilibrium, and preserves an equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for particles undergoing drift-diffusion on the unstructured mesh. We next formulate a spatially-continuous volume reactivity particle-based reaction-drift-diffusion model for reversible reactions of the form $\textrm{A} + \textrm{B} \leftrightarrow \textrm{C}$. A finite volume discretization is used to generate jump process approximations to reaction terms in this model. The discretization is developed to ensure the combined reaction-drift-diffusion jump process approximation is consistent with detailed balance of reaction fluxes holding at equilibrium, along with supporting a discrete version of the continuous equilibrium state. The new CRDDME model represents a continuous-time discrete-space jump process approximation to the underlying volume reactivity model. We demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the new CRDDME through a number of numerical examples, and illustrate its use on an idealized model for membrane protein receptor dynamics in T cell signaling.</description>

      <title>A projected Euler Method for Random Periodic Solutions of Semi-linear SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work introduces and investigates an explicit time discretization scheme, called the projected Euler method,to numerically approximate random periodic solutions of semi-linear SDEs under non-globally Lipschitz conditions. The existence of the random periodic solution is demonstrated as the limit of the pull-back of the discretized SDE. Without relying on a priori high-order moment bounds of the numerical approximations, the mean square convergence rate of the approximation scheme is proved to be order $0.5$ for SDEs with multiplicative noise and order $1$ for SDEs with additive noise. Numerical examples are also provided to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Accurate close interactions of Stokes spheres using lubrication-adapted image systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stokes flows with near-touching rigid particles induce near-singular lubrication forces under relative motion, making their accurate numerical treatment challenging. With the aim of controlling the accuracy with a computationally cheap method, we present a new technique that combines the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) with the method of images. For rigid spheres, we propose to represent the flow using Stokeslet proxy sources on interior spheres, augmented by lines of image sources adapted to each near-contact to resolve lubrication. Source strengths are found by a least-squares solve at contact-adapted boundary collocation nodes. We include extensive numerical tests, and validate against reference solutions from a well-resolved boundary integral formulation. With less than 60 additional image sources per particle per contact, we show controlled uniform accuracy to three relative digits in surface velocities, and up to five digits in particle forces and torques, for all separations down to a thousandth of the radius. In the special case of flows around fixed particles, the proxy sphere alone gives controlled accuracy. A one-body preconditioning strategy allows acceleration with the fast multipole method, hence close to linear scaling in the number of particles. This is demonstrated by solving problems of up to 2000 spheres on a workstation using only 700 proxy sources per particle.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the convergence of generalized kernel-based interpolation methods. This is done under minimalistic assumptions on both the kernel and the target function. On these grounds, we further prove convergence of popular greedy data selection algorithms for totally bounded sets of sampling functionals. Supporting numerical results concerning computerized tomography are provided for illustration.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport Scheme for the 3D Incompressible Semi-Geostrophic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a mesh-free three-dimensional numerical scheme for solving the incompressible semi-geostrophic equations based on semi-discrete optimal transport techniques. These results generalise previous two-dimensional implementations. The optimal transport methods we adopt are known for their structural preservation and energy conservation qualities and achieve an excellent level of efficiency and numerical energy-conservation. We use this scheme to generate numerical simulations of an important cyclone benchmark problem. To our knowledge, this is the first fully three-dimensional simulation of the semi-geostrophic equations, evidencing semi-discrete optimal transport as a novel, robust numerical tool for meteorological and oceanographic modelling.</description>

      <title>Single-Frequency Self-Alignment RF Resonant Beam for Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to power attenuation, improving transmission efficiency in the radio-frequency (RF) band remains a significant challenge, which hinders advancements in various fields of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as wireless power transfer (WPT) and wireless communication. Array design and retro-directive beamforming (RD-BF) techniques offer simple and effective ways to enhance transmission efficiency. However, when the target is an array or in the near field, the RD-BF system (RD-BFS) cannot radiate more energy to the target due to phase irregularities in the target region, resulting in challenges in achieving higher efficiency. To address this issue, we propose the RF-based resonant beam system (RF-RBS), which adaptively optimizes phase and power distribution between transmitting and receiving arrays by leveraging the resonance mechanism to achieve higher transmission efficiency. We analyze the system structure and develop an analytical model to evaluate power flow and resonance establishment. Numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed RF-RBS achieves self-alignment without beam control and provides higher transmission efficiency compared to RD-BFS, with improvements of up to 16%. This self-alignment capability allows the system to effectively transfer power and information across varying distances and offsets. The numerical results indicate the capability to transmit watt-level power and achieve 21 bps/Hz of downlink spectral efficiency in indoor settings, highlighting the advantages of RF-RBS in information and power transfer for mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of the Deep Mixed Residual Method for High-order Elliptic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an a priori error analysis of the Deep Mixed Residual method (MIM) for solving high-order elliptic equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions. We examine MIM with two types of loss functions, referred to as first-order and second-order least squares systems. By providing boundedness and coercivity analysis, we leverage C\'{e}a's Lemma to decompose the total error into the approximation, generalization, and optimization errors. Utilizing the Barron space theory and Rademacher complexity, an a priori error is derived regarding the training samples and network size that are exempt from the curse of dimensionality. Our results reveal that MIM significantly reduces the regularity requirements for activation functions compared to the deep Ritz method, implying the effectiveness of MIM in solving high-order equations.</description>

      <title>Cutting Voxel Projector a New Approach to Construct 3D Cone Beam CT Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel class of projectors for 3D cone beam tomographic reconstruction. Analytical formulas are derived to compute the relationship between the volume of a voxel projected onto a detector pixel and its contribution to the line integral of attenuation recorded by that pixel. Based on these formulas, we construct a near-exact projector and backprojector, particularly suited for algebraic reconstruction techniques and hierarchical reconstruction approaches with nonuniform voxel grids. Unlike traditional projectors, which assume a uniform grid with fixed voxel sizes, our method enables local refinement of voxels, allowing for adaptive grid resolution and improved reconstruction quality in regions of interest. We have implemented this cutting voxel projector along with a relaxed, speed-optimized version and compared them to two established projectors: a ray-tracing projector based on Siddon's algorithm and a TT footprint projector. Our results demonstrate that the cutting voxel projector achieves higher accuracy than the TT projector, especially for large cone beam angles. Furthermore, the relaxed version of the cutting voxel projector offers a significant speed advantage over current footprint projector implementations, while maintaining comparable accuracy. In contrast, Siddon's algorithm, when achieving similar accuracy, is considerably slower than the cutting voxel projector. All algorithms are implemented in an open-source framework for algebraic reconstruction using OpenCL and C++, optimized for efficient GPU computation.

      <title>Rational kernel-based interpolation for complex-valued frequency response functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the kernel-based approximation of a complex-valued function from data, where the frequency response function of a partial differential equation in the frequency domain is of particular interest. In this setting, kernel methods are employed more and more frequently, however, standard kernels do not perform well. Moreover, the role and mathematical implications of the underlying pair of kernels, which arises naturally in the complex-valued case, remain to be addressed. We introduce new reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of complex-valued functions, and formulate the problem of complex-valued interpolation with a kernel pair as minimum norm interpolation in these spaces. Moreover, we combine the interpolant with a low-order rational function, where the order is adaptively selected based on a new model selection criterion. Numerical results on examples from different fields, including electromagnetics and acoustic examples, illustrate the performance of the method, also in comparison to available rational approximation methods.</description>
