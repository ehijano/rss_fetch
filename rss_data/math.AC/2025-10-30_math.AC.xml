      <title>Formalization of Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in Lean4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalized a complete proof of the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in the Lean4 theorem prover. For a local ring, rather than following the well-known proof that considers the residue field as the quotient of the ring by a regular sequence to compute projective dimension and uses the Koszul complex to show the dimension of the cotangent space is at most the global dimension, we prove the criterion via maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules and a weakened version of the Ferrand--Vasconcelos theorem, which is more amenable to the formalization process and the current development of mathlib. Our formalization includes the construction of depth and of Cohen--Macaulay modules and rings, which are used frequently in the proof of the criterion. We also developed related results, including the unmixedness theorem for Cohen--Macaulay rings and Hilbert's Syzygy theorem.</description>

      <title>Generalized Additive Decompositions of Symmetric Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the Generalized Additive Decomposition (GAD) of symmetric tensors, that is, degree-$d$ forms $f \in \mathcal{S}_d$. From a geometric perspective, a GAD corresponds to representing a point on a secant of osculating varieties to the Veronese variety, providing a compact and structured description of a tensor that captures its intrinsic algebraic properties.
  We provide a linear algebra method for measuring the GAD size and prove that the minimal achievable size, which we call the GAD-rank of the considered tensor, coincides with the rank of suitable Catalecticant matrices, under certain regularity assumptions. We provide a new explicit description of the apolar scheme associated with a GAD as the annihilator of a polynomial-exponential series. We show that if the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of this scheme is sufficiently small, then both the GAD and the associated apolar scheme are minimal and unique.
  Leveraging these results, we develop a numerical GAD algorithm for symmetric tensors that effectively exploits the underlying algebraic structure, extending existing algebraic approaches based on eigen computation to the treatment of multiple points. We illustrate the effectiveness and numerical stability of such an algorithm through several examples, including Waring and tangential decompositions.</description>

      <title>On the k-th Milnor and k-th Tjurina Numbers of a Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of the $k$-th Milnor number and the $k$-th Tjurina number for a germ of holomorphic foliation on the complex plane with an isolated singularity at the origin. We develop a detailed study of these invariants, establishing explicit formulas and relating them to other indices associated with holomorphic foliations. In particular, we obtain an explicit expression for the $k$-th Milnor number of a foliation and, as a consequence, a formula for the $k$-th Milnor number of a holomorphic function. We analyze their topological behavior, proving that the $k$-th Milnor number of a holomorphic function is a topological invariant, whereas the $k$-th Tjurina number is not. In dimension two, we provide a positive answer to a conjecture posed by Hussain, Liu, Yau, and Zuo concerning a sharp lower bound for the $k$-th Tjurina number of a weighted homogeneous polynomial. We also present a counterexample to another conjecture of Hussain, Yau, and Zuo regarding the ratio between these invariants. Moreover, we establish a fundamental relation linking the $k$-th Tjurina numbers of a foliation and of an invariant curve via the G\'omez-Mont--Seade--Verjovsky index, and we extend Teissier's Lemma to the setting of $k$-th polar intersection numbers. In addition, we derive an upper bound for the $k$-th Milnor number of a foliation in terms of its $k$-th Tjurina number along balanced divisors of separatrices. Finally, for non-dicritical quasi-homogeneous foliations, we obtain a closed formula for their $k$-th Milnor and Tjurina numbers.</description>

      <title>Rook placements and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>The complex of $r$-co-connected subgraphs, chordality and Fr\"oberg's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of pure simplicial complexes, called the $r$-co-connected complex of $G$ with respect to $A$, $\Sigma_r(A,G)$, where $r\geq 1$ is a natural number, $G$ is a simple graph, and $A$ is a subset of vertices. Interestingly, when $A$ is empty, this complex is precisely the Alexander dual of the $r$-independence complex of $G$. We focus on uncovering the relationship between the topological and combinatorial properties of the complex and the algebraic and homological properties of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the dual complex. First, we prove that $\Sigma_r(A,G)$ is vertex decomposable whenever the induced subgraph $G[A]$ is connected and nonempty, yielding a versatile deletion-link calculus for higher independence via Alexander duality. Furthermore, when $A=\emptyset$ and $r \ge 2$, we establish that for several significant classes of graphs - including chordal, co-chordal, cographs, cycles, complements of cycles, and certain grid graphs - the properties of vertex decomposability, shellability, and Cohen-Macaulayness are equivalent and precisely characterized by the co-chordality of the associated clutter $\mathrm{Con}_r(G)$. These results extend Fr\"oberg's theorem to the setting of $r$-connected ideals for these graph classes and motivate a conjecture concerning the linear resolution property of $r$-connected ideals in general. We also construct examples separating shellability from vertex decomposability.</description>

      <title>The GroebnerWalk.jl package for OSCAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing Gr\"obner bases is known to have a very high upper bound on computation time with respect to input length. Due to the connection between polyhedral geometry and Gr\"obner bases through the Gr\"obner fan, one can attempt an incremental approach to compute Gr\"obner bases. First computing a Gr\"obner basis with respect to an `easy' term order and transforming that result to a Gr\"obner basis with respect to the desired term order by using information about this polyhedral fan is done by a family of algorithms termed as Gr\"obner walk. We implemented two variants of the Gr\"obner walk in the computer algebra system OSCAR and compared their performance with classical Gr\"obner basis methods already found in OSCAR.</description>

      <title>Computing Certificates of Strictly Positive Polynomials in Archimedean Quadratic Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New results on computing certificates of strictly positive polynomials in Archimedean quadratic modules are presented. The results build upon (i) Averkov's method for generating a strictly positive polynomial for which a membership certificate can be more easily computed than the input polynomial whose certificate is being sought, and (ii) Lasserre's method for generating a certificate by successively approximating a nonnegative polynomial by sums of squares. First, a fully constructive method based on Averkov's result is given by providing details about the parameters; further, his result is extended to work on arbitrary subsets, in particular, the whole Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, producing globally strictly positive polynomials. Second, Lasserre's method is integrated with the extended Averkov construction to generate certificates. Third, the methods have been implemented and their effectiveness is illustrated. Examples are given on which the existing software package RealCertify appears to struggle, whereas the proposed method succeeds in generating certificates. Several situations are identified where an Archimedean polynomial does not have to be explicitly included in a set of generators of an Archimedean quadratic module. Unlike other approaches for addressing the problem of computing certificates, the methods/approach presented is easier to understand as well as implement.</description>

      <title>On modular invariants of the truncated polynomial ring in rank four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11464v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the rank-4 case of the conjecture of Ha-Hai-Nghia for the invariant subspace of the truncated polynomial ring $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)=\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\dots,x_n^{q^m}),$ under a new, explicit technical hypothesis. Our argument extends the determinant calculus for the delta operator by deriving crucial rank-4 identities governing its interaction with the Dickson algebra. We show that the proof of the conjecture reduces to a specific vanishing property, for which we introduce a sufficient condition, the "matching hypothesis" ($\mathrm{H_{match}}$), relating the degree structures of Dickson invariants. This condition is justified by theoretical arguments and verified computationally in many cases. Combining this approach with the normalized derivation approach from our prior work, we establish the conjecture. As a result, the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton Conjecture is also confirmed for rank four under the given hypothesis.</description>

      <title>An extension of Viennot's shadow to rook placements via orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m,r$ with $r \leq \min(n,m)$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n \times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space of $n \times m$ complex matrices with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]$. We define a homogeneous ideal $I_{n,m,r}$, where the graded quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ carries an action of the group $\mathfrak{S}_n \times \mathfrak{S}_m$ by independent permutations of rows and columns. This quotient ring is obtained by applying the orbit harmonics method to matrix loci corresponding to all rook placements of size at least $r$. We show that the quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ admits a standard monomial basis, which is determined by extending rook placements to an element in $\mathfrak{S}_{n+m-r}$ and applying Viennot's shadow line avatar of the Schensted correspondence. We also determine the graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module structure of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$.</description>
