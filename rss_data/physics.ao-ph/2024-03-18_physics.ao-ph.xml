      <title>KARINA: An Efficient Deep Learning Model for Global Weather Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based, data-driven models are gaining prevalence in climate research, particularly for global weather prediction. However, training the global weather data at high resolution requires massive computational resources. Therefore, we present a new model named KARINA to overcome the substantial computational demands typical of this field. This model achieves forecasting accuracy comparable to higher-resolution counterparts with significantly less computational resources, requiring only 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and less than 12 hours of training. KARINA combines ConvNext, SENet, and Geocyclic Padding to enhance weather forecasting at a 2.5{\deg} resolution, which could filter out high-frequency noise. Geocyclic Padding preserves pixels at the lateral boundary of the input image, thereby maintaining atmospheric flow continuity in the spherical Earth. SENet dynamically improves feature response, advancing atmospheric process modeling, particularly in the vertical column process as numerous channels. In this vein, KARINA sets new benchmarks in weather forecasting accuracy, surpassing existing models like the ECMWF S2S reforecasts at a lead time of up to 7 days. Remarkably, KARINA achieved competitive performance even when compared to the recently developed models (Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, ClimaX, and FourCastNet) trained with high-resolution data having 100 times larger pixels. Conclusively, KARINA significantly advances global weather forecasting by efficiently modeling Earth's atmosphere with improved accuracy and resource efficiency.</description>

      <title>Recurrence analysis of meteorological data from climate zones in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on the spatio-temporal pattern underlying the climate dynamics in various locations spread over India, including the Himalayan region, coastal region, central and northeastern parts of India. We try to capture the variations in the complexity of their dynamics derived from temperature and relative humidity data from 1948-2022. By estimating the recurrence-based measures from the reconstructed phase space dynamics using a sliding window analysis on the data sets, we study the climate variability in different spatial locations. The study brings out the variations in the complexity of the underlying dynamics as well as their heterogeneity across the locations in India. We find almost all locations indicate shifts to more irregular and stochastic dynamics for temperature data around 1972-79 and shifts back to more regular dynamics beyond 2000. These patterns correlate with reported shifts in the climate and Indian Summer Monsoon related to strong and moderate ENSO events and confirm their associated regional variability.</description>

      <title>Identifying Three-Dimensional Radiative Patterns Associated with Early Tropical Cyclone Intensification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud radiative feedback impacts early tropical cyclone (TC) intensification, but limitations in existing diagnostic frameworks make them unsuitable for studying asymmetric or transient radiative heating. We propose a linear Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED) to learn the hidden relationship between radiation and the surface intensification of realistic simulated TCs. Limiting VED model inputs enables using its uncertainty to identify periods when radiation has more importance for intensification. A close examination of the extracted 3D radiative structures suggests that longwave radiative forcing from inner core deep convection and shallow clouds both contribute to intensification, with the deep convection having the most impact overall. We find that deep convection downwind of the shallow clouds is critical to the intensification of Haiyan. Our work demonstrates that machine learning can discover thermodynamic-kinematic relationships without relying on axisymmetric or deterministic assumptions, paving the way towards the objective discovery of processes leading to TC intensification in realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Air-sea interactions on Titan: effect of radiative transfer on the lake evaporation and atmospheric circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Titan's northern high latitudes host many large hydrocarbon lakes. Like water lakes on Earth, Titan's lakes are constantly subject to evaporation. This process strongly affects the atmospheric methane abundance, the atmospheric temperature, the lake mixed layer temperature, and the local wind circulation. In this work we use a 2D atmospheric mesoscale model coupled to a slab lake model to investigate the effect of solar and infrared radiation on the exchange of energy and methane between Titan's lakes and atmosphere. The magnitude of solar radiation reaching the surface of Titan through its thick atmosphere is only a few $Wm^{-2}$. However, we find that this small energy input is important and is comparable in absolute magnitude to the latent and sensible heat fluxes, as suggested in the prior study by Rafkin and Soto (2020). The implementation of a gray radiative scheme in the model confirms the importance of radiation when studying lakes at the surface of Titan. Solar and infrared radiation change the energy balance of the system leading to an enhancement of the methane evaporation rate, an increase of the equilibrium lake temperature almost completely determined by its environment (humidity, insolation, and background wind), and a strengthening of the local sea breeze, which undergoes diurnal variations. The sea breeze efficiently transports methane vapor horizontally, from the lake to the land, and vertically due to rising motion along the sea breeze front and due to radiation-induced turbulence over the land.</description>

      <title>The impact of lake shape and size on lake breezes and air-lake exchanges on Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, has many lakes on its surface, formed mainly of liquid methane. Like water lakes on Earth, these methane lakes on Titan likely profoundly affect the local climate. Previous studies (Rafkin and Soto 2020, Chatain et al 2022) showed that Titan's lakes create lake breeze circulations with characteristic dimensions similar to the ones observed on Earth. However, such studies used a model in two dimensions; this work investigates the consequences of the addition of a third dimension to the model. Our results show that 2D simulations tend to overestimate the extension of the lake breeze over the land, and underestimate the strength of the subsidence over the lake, due to divergence/convergence geometrical effects in the mass conservation equations. In addition, 3D simulations including a large scale background wind show the formation of a pocket of accelerated wind behind the lake, which did not form in 2D simulations. An investigation of the effect of shoreline concavity on the resulting air circulation shows the formation of wind currents over peninsulas. Simulations with several lakes can either result in the formation of several individual lake breeze cells (during the day), or the emergence of a large merged cell with internal wind currents between lakes (during the night). Simulations of several real-shaped lakes located at a latitude of 74{\deg}N on Titan at the autumn equinox show that larger lakes trigger stronger winds, and that some sections of lakes might accumulate enough methane vapor to form a thin fog. The addition of a third dimension, along with adjustments in the parametrizations of turbulence and subsurface land temperature, results in a reduction in the magnitude of the average lake evaporate rate, namely to ~6 cm/Earth year.</description>

      <title>A Temporal Bias Correction using a Machine Learning Attention model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate models are biased with respect to real world observations and usually need to be calibrated prior to impact studies. The suite of statistical methods that enable such calibrations is called bias correction (BC). However, current BC methods struggle to adjust for temporal biases, because they disregard the dependence between consecutive time-points. As a result, climate statistics with long-range temporal properties, such as heatwave duration and frequency, cannot be corrected accurately, making it more difficult to produce reliable impact studies on such climate statistics. In this paper, we offer a novel BC methodology to correct for temporal biases. This is made possible by i) re-thinking BC as a probability model rather than an algorithmic procedure, and ii) adapting state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML) probabilistic attention models to fit the BC task. With a case study of heatwave duration statistics in Abuja, Nigeria, and Tokyo, Japan, we show striking results compared to current climate model outputs and alternative BC methods.</description>
