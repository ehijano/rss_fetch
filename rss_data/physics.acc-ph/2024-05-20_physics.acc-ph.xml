      <title>Two-dimensional Synchrotron Beam Characterisation from a Single Interferogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-aperture Young interferometry is widely used in accelerators to provide a one-dimensional beam measurement. We improve this technique by combining and further developing techniques of non-redundant aperture masking and self-calibration from astronomy. Using visible synchrotron radiation, tests at the ALBA synchrotron show that this method provides an accurate two-dimensional beam transverse characterisation, even from a single 1ms interferogram. The technique is resistant to phase fluctuations that might be introduced by vibration of optical components, or in the laboratory atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Compact Spin-Polarized Positron Acceleration in Multi-Layer Microhole Array Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact spin-polarized positron accelerators play a major role in promoting significant positron application research, which typically require high acceleration gradients and polarization degree, both of which, however, are still great challenging. Here, we put forward a novel spin-polarized positron acceleration method which employs an ultrarelativistic high-density electron beam passing through any hole of multi-layer microhole array films to excite strong electrostatic and transition radiation fields. Positrons in the polarized electron-positron pair plasma, filled in the front of the multi-layer films, can be captured, accelerated, and focused by the electrostatic and transition radiation fields, while maintaining high polarization of above 90% and high acceleration gradient of about TeV/m. Multi-layer design allows for capturing more positrons and achieving cascade acceleration. Our method offers a promising solution for accelerator miniaturization, positron injection, and polarization maintaining, and also can be used to accelerate other charged particles.</description>

      <title>Auger photoemission as a laser-like coherent cathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of quantum advancements across disciplines, a bright and coherent electron source is expected to be a cornerstone of diverse applications including electron microscopy, laser accelerators, and free electron lasers. Current cathodes, such as cold field and photoemission, can generate high-quality electron beams with different cathode materials, geometric configurations, and laser excitation profiles, but their maintenance of both quantum coherence and high beam brightness suffers from the space-charge repulsion of many electrons. Here, we propose a new mechanism to provide collective emission of coherent electrons based on Auger photoemission. Our approach leverages a photon-induced four-level Auger process that necessitates a combination of photoemission and Auger recombination. The Auger electrons, energized through a recycling process of photoelectrons, emit collectively into the vacuum as secondary electrons. We compare coherent and incoherent Auger photoemission, identifying that the working condition of the coherent photoemission requires population inversion, akin to the four-level laser system. Our work provides insights for experimental realization and nanofabrication of Auger photocathodes, addressing a critical need in advancing quantum technologies relating to correlated coherent sources.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the vulnerability of space habitats to cosmic radiation, which consists of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, raises important safety concerns for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation consists of experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators, marking a notable advancement in this field. Intriguingly, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth offer potential solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. Additionally, we recommend assessing the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>

      <title>The LCLS-II Photoinjector Laser Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive technical overview of the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) photoinjector laser system, its first and foremost component. The LCLS-II photoinjector laser system serves as an upgrade to the original LCLS at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. This advanced laser system generates high-quality laser beams for LCLS-II, contributing to the instrument's unprecedented brightness, precision, and flexibility. Our discussion extends to the various subsystems that comprise the photoinjector, including the photocathode laser, laser heater, and beam transport systems. Lastly, we draw attention to the ongoing research and development infrastructure underway to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the LCLS-II, and similar X-ray free-electron laser facilities around the world, thereby contributing to the future of laser technology and its applications.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal phase space diagnostics with a nonmovable corrugated passive wakefield streaker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved diagnostics at Free-Electron Laser (FEL) facilities, in particular electron beam longitudinal phase space (LPS) and FEL power profile measurements, provide information highly valuable for users, machine development studies, and beam setup. We investigate the slice energy resolution of passive streaker setups, in particular the effect of an energy chirp on the measured slice energy spread. Downstream of the hard X-ray SASE2 beamline at the European XFEL, these measurements are enabled by a single-plate non-movable passive wakefield streaker, essentially a rectangular corrugated plate placed inside a vacuum chamber. We show measurements with a time resolution down to a few femtoseconds, and an energy resolution down to a few MeVs.</description>

      <title>Design and commissioning of a high-level control system for a medical isochronous cyclotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MEDICYC (MEDical CYClotron) is an isochronous cyclotron dedicated to radiotherapy which was built and commissioned in Nice, France, in 1990 by a local team aided by experts from CERN. The cyclotron accelerates negative H to a maximum energy of 65 MeV and uses stripping to extract a proton beam. Its primary purpose is treating ocular melanoma by protontherapy but a significant research activity is also present on beam-lines dedicated for this purpose. An extensive refurbishment program of the cyclotron has been started to cope with the end-of-life and/or the obsolescence of several sub-systems. In this context, a new high-level cyclotron control system has been developed and commissioned in 2021-2024. The primary responsibility of the system is the high-level coordination of the source, the RF system, the beam-line and cyclotron magnets, to produce and deliver a beam with a given set of characteristics. A secondary responsibility is the collection, visualization and analysis of sub-system and beam data for monitoring and pre-emptive fault detection. In this contribution, the control system software architecture is presented and the infrastructure on which the systems are deployed is laid out.</description>
