      <title>Interpretable inverse design of optical multilayer thin films based on extended neural adjoint and regression activation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extended neural adjoint (ENA) framework, which meets six key criteria for artificial intelligence-assisted inverse design of optical multilayer thin films (OMTs): accuracy, efficiency, diversity, scalability, flexibility, and interpretability. To enhance the scalability of the existing neural adjoint method, we present a novel forward neural network architecture for OMTs and introduce a material loss function into the existing neural adjoint loss function, facilitating the exploration of material configurations of OMTs. Furthermore, we present the detailed formulation of the regression activation mapping for the presented forward neural network architecture (F-RAM), a feature visualization method aimed at improving interpretability. We validated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study, where each component of the loss function is systematically removed and evaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss significantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance of the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual network-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT solutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity compared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied F-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by the proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for various OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent, despite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting the initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm.</description>

      <title>Liquid crystal based tailoring of strong coupling in \ch{WS2} metasurfaces: towards reconfigurable quantum photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions in 2D materials have garnered significant interest for their potential in nonlinear optics and quantum photonics. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), with their robust excitonic responses, serve as promising materials for exploring these interactions. Importantly, tailoring such strong coupling giving rise to tunable quantum and non-linear emissions are under explored. In this study, we propose a novel approach that employs liquid crystals (LCs) as a tunable medium to modulate the strong coupling between TMDC excitons and photonic modes and hence gives rise to tunable quantum emissions. LCs offer high birefringence and anisotropic optical properties, which can be dynamically tuned using external stimuli such as electric fields or temperature variations. By embedding TMDCs within an LC environment and coupling them to photonic quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC), we demonstrate precise control over the exciton-photon interactions. The orientation of the LCs, governed by applied external fields, directly influences the coupling strength, enabling real-time modulation of exciton-polariton states and Rabi-splitting. Our system exhibits Rabi splitting energy of 182.5 MeV in air, and 139, 153.7, and 131 meV under different LC orientations. Additionally second order autocorrelation function calculated at zero delay yields \( g^{(2)}(0) = 0.89 \), demonstrating photon anti-bunching, confirming the quantum nature of emission. Our findings establish a versatile platform where TMDCs and LCs synergistically enable electrically controllable strong coupling, offering a scalable and responsive architecture for next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced photon-pair generation from a van der Waals metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum photon pairs play a pivotal role in many quantum applications. Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of nanostructures, have been studied intensively to enhance and control pair generation via spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Van der Waals (VdW) layered materials have emerged as promising candidates for nonlinear materials in quantum light sources, owing to their high nonlinear susceptibility and compatibility with on-chip integration. In this work, we present the first demonstration of SPDC from a metasurface composed of the VdW material 3R-MoS2. The nanoresonators support quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) with a quality factor of up to 120, enhancing light-matter interactions. This design achieves a 20-fold increase in SPDC rate compared to an unstructured film and significantly higher brightness, resulting in enhanced quantum photon-pair generation. This work establishes a new approach for utilizing van der Waals metasurfaces in the generation of quantum photon pairs, opening avenues for advanced quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the indirect bandgap: efficient silicon emission via momentum-expanded photonic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon's inherently indirect bandgap severely limits its radiative efficiency, posing a fundamental challenge to the development of practical silicon-based light sources. While strategies such as nanoscale confinement of electrons and holes (quantum dots), Mie resonators, and hybrid plasmonic structures have improved emission, they typically require complex fabrication workflows. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually distinct and scalable approach to enable light emission from a bulk silicon wafer by decorating its surface with gold or copper nanoparticles. Remarkably, the effect is nearly identical for Au and Cu, with particle size emerging as the dominant factor. We show that strong luminescence from the bulk wafer emerges only when the nanoparticle diameter is below 2 nm. We attribute this effect to the formation of spatially confined photonic states with broadened momentum distributions, which must enable diagonal, phonon-independent optical transitions that bypass the limitations imposed by silicon's indirect bandgap. This mechanism yields broadband emission across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, with quantum efficiencies comparable to direct bandgap semiconductors, representing a 10^5-fold increase in integrated spectral intensity. This discovery challenges the conventional understanding of silicon's optical constraints and opens a practical pathway toward high-performance silicon-based optical and optoelectronic components.</description>

      <title>Few-cycle THz Pulse Generation in DSTMS Crystal Pumped by a 8.3-MHz Amplified Mamyshev Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mamyshev oscillators are an emerging class of ultrafast fiber lasers that support exceptionally broadband spectra and few-femtosecond pulse durations, making them well-suited for nonlinear frequency conversion. Despite this potential, THz generation using Mamyshev oscillators has not been demonstrated to date. In this work, we report the generation of THz few-cycle at 8.3 MHz repetition rate via optical rectification of a 31-fs pulse duration, 1-W average power amplified Mamyshev oscillator in a 190-um-thick DSTMS organic crystal. We measured a THz average power of 40 uW and a spectral bandwidth of 4 THz. To further investigate the advantage of combining Mamyshev oscillator and organic crystals for THz generation at multi-MHz repetition rate, we compared the THz pulses with those generated using a conventional inorganic 500 um-thick GaP crystal, obtaining comparable bandwidth, but 20 times lower power with respect to DSTMS.</description>

      <title>Feature-Resolved Photoluminescence Analysis: Probing Emission Beyond Conventional Photon Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a feature-resolved methodology to analyse the photoluminescence dynamics of single emitters using a combination of lifetime, spectral, and photon correlation analyses. By integrating conventional ensemble photon statistics measurements with emission state-resolved, spectrally filtered, and lifetime-gated methods, we uncover emission dynamics that remain hidden in ensemble treatment. We study the fluorescence of single CdSe/CdS core/shell colloidal quantum dots under varying excitation powers. Using feature-resolved analysis, we understand the radiative and non-radiative recombination processes, and estimate quantum parameters. Event-selective analysis provides a versatile toolkit for characterizing emitters, both single and aggregate particles. These methods are broadly applicable to a wide class of photoluminescent emitters, such as nitrogen vacancy centres in nanodiamond, epitaxial quantum dots, and perovskite nanocrystals. The application of these lateral investigation techniques will contribute to the advancement of quantum light source development.</description>

      <title>Raman-enabled platicon microcomb in 4H-SiC microresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering in a Kerr microresonator is generally considered a competing nonlinear process that hinders the formation of Kerr soliton microcombs. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that the ubiquitous Raman gain in Kerr microresonators can, in fact, be harnessed to achieve the opposite effect: it enables the formation of platicon microcomb in the normal dispersion regime, while also relaxing the conditions for soliton formation and broadening the spectrum through the simultaneous excitation of a Stokes soliton. We showcase this process in a compact silicon carbide microresonator supporting a platicon microcomb spanning 1500 to 1700 nm, with a pump-to-comb conversion efficiency as high as $56\%$. Furthermore, the presence of a Stokes soliton in the same mode family extends the comb spectrum beyond 1800 nm. By intentionally leveraging-rather than suppressing-the Raman effect, our work offers new insights into the Raman-Kerr interplay and introduces a promising approach to generating broadband platicon microcombs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Terahertz Polaritonics in a Quantum Paraelectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency range holds immense potential for high-speed data processing and signal manipulation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: the efficient and tunable control of THz electromagnetic fields. One promising approach is polaritonic engineering, which leverages hybrid light-matter excitations to manipulate THz fields at sub-wavelength scales. Here, we introduce quantum paraelectric materials as a powerful new platform for THz phonon-polaritonics, leveraging the pronounced nonlinearities of incipient ferroelectrics. These nonlinearities enable strong self- and cross-coupling between polaritons, facilitating all-optical, reconfigurable THz signal control. Using a novel space- and time-resolved imaging technique, we directly observe the ballistic propagation of bulk phonon-polaritons in SrTiO$_3$, and uncover soliton-like, dispersion-free transport in its low-temperature, quantum-fluctuation-dominated phase. Our results establish quantum paraelectric solids as a versatile and highly tunable medium for next-generation THz photonics and ultrafast information processing.</description>

      <title>Probing Optical Magnetic Dipole Transitions in Eu$^{3+}$ using Structured Light and Nanoscale Sample Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At optical frequencies, interactions of the electric field component of light with matter are dominating, whereas magnetic dipole transitions are inherently weak and challenging to access independently from electric dipole transitions. However, magnetic dipole transitions are of interest, as they can provide valuable complementary information about the matter under investigation. Here, we present an approach which combines structured light irradiation with tailored sample morphology for enhanced and highcontrast optical magnetic field excitation, and we test this technique on Eu$^{3+}$ ions. We generate spectrally tunable, narrowband, polarization-shaped ultrashort laser pulses, which are specifically optimized for the spectral and the spatial selective excitation of magnetic dipole and electric dipole transitions in Eu$^{3+}$ : Y$_2$O$_3$ nanostructures integrated into a metallic antenna. In the presence of the metallic antenna, the excitation with an azimuthally polarized beam is shown to provide at least a 3.0-4.5-fold enhancement of the magnetic dipole transition as compared to a radially polarized beam or a conventional Gaussian beam. Thus, our setup provides new opportunities for the spectroscopy of forbidden transitions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Contrast Transfer: Spectral SNR as a Dose-Aware Metric for STEM Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), including center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and iterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable signal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the Poisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly overestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by recent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation for Serial Conjunction of Diffraction-limited Coronagraph and Fiber Nuller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental results of a serially conjoined nuller system, which combines a type of Lyot coronagraph with a fiber nuller. The utilized one-dimensional diffraction-limited coronagraph (1DDLC) has promising features (binary nuller, small inner working angles (IWAs)). Still, it has a performance that is highly sensitive to spectral bandwidth and tilt aberrations. Nevertheless, for the 1DDLC, wavelengths other than the design wavelength introduce leaks with a flat wavefront on the Lyot-stop plane, preserving the same complex amplitude profile as an on-axis point source. This property supports the concept of serially coupling additional nullers after the 1DDLC. The fiber-nulling unit employs a Lyot-plane mask, relay optics (1/100$\times$), and a single-mode fiber. The Lyot-plane mask splits the incoming beam -- comprising leakage from the 1DDLC and planetary light -- into four beams so that, in principle, the on-axis single-mode fiber does not couple with the on-axis leak from the 1DDLC. For the wavelength 6-\% less than the coronagraph's design-center wavelength, we confirmed the contrast mitigation ability of $3.5 \times 10^{-5}$, which is about 1/20 times the value of the case with only 1DDLC. The resultant value approximately reaches the 1DDLC's contrast mitigation ability at the design center wavelength demonstrated in the previous study, suggesting that the combined system works robustly against the broad spectral bandwidth. Future work needs to address the demonstration of the anticipated robustness for the contrast-mitigation level lower than about $10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Learned Single-Pixel Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum description of the four-wave mixing contribution to correlated Stokes-anti-Stokes scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes-anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that the correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation, corresponding to a four-wave mixing phenomenon. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</description>

Abstract: Conical intersections play a pivotal role in excited-state quantum dynamics. Capturing transient molecular structures near conical intersections remains challenging due to the rapid timescales and subtle structural changes involved. We overcome this by combining the enhanced temporal resolution of mega-electron-volt ultrafast electron diffraction with a super-resolution real-space inversion algorithm, enabling visualization of nuclear and electronic motions at conical intersections with sub-angstrom resolution, surpassing the diffraction limit. We apply this technique to the textbook example of the ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which proceeds through two conical intersections within 100 femtoseconds. The super-resolved transient structures near conical intersections reveal a C-C bond length difference of less than 0.4 angstrom and an approximately 30-femtosecond traversal time of the nuclear wave packet between them. These findings establish super-resolution ultrafast scattering as a transformative tool for uncovering quantum dynamics in molecules and open new avenues for studying light-matter interactions at the most fundamental level.</description>

      <title>Waveguide-Coupled Mid-Infrared GeSn Membrane Photodetectors on Silicon-on-Insulator</title>

Abstract: Silicon photonics has thrived in telecommunications over recent decades, and its extension to the mid-infrared range has the potential to unlock valuable opportunities for sensing, imaging, and free-space communications. With this perspective, germanium-tin (GeSn) alloy has been extensively investigated as a silicon-compatible semiconductor with bandgap tunability that covers this entire spectral range. Indeed, a variety of GeSn-based high-performance optoelectronic devices have been demonstrated, confirming the potential of this system for mid-infrared applications. However, the integration of these devices onto silicon photonic platforms remains underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication and integration, through transfer-printing, of strain-relaxed GeSn membranes onto silicon-on-insulator waveguides to create integrated detectors operating up to 3.1 $\mu$m at room temperature. Two different designs of waveguide structures are evaluated to study the coupling efficiency between the passive structures and the active membrane detector. A responsivity reaching 0.36 A/W at an operation wavelength of 2.33 $\mu$m is measured under a bias of 1 V. Moreover, the fabrication resulted in multiple working devices exhibiting similar performance using a single transfer printing step, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Is the Full Power of Gaussian Boson Sampling Required for Simulating Vibronic Spectra Using Photonics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating vibronic spectra is a central task in physical chemistry, offering insight into important properties of molecules. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that photonic platforms based on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) are capable of performing these simulations. However, whether an actual GBS approach is required depends on the molecule under investigation. To develop a better understanding on the requirements for simulating vibronic spectra, we explore connections between theoretical approximations in physical chemistry and their photonic counterparts. Mapping these approximations into photonics, we show that for certain molecules the GBS approach is unnecessary. We place special emphasis on the linear coupling approximation, which in photonics corresponds to sampling from multiple coherent states. By implementing this approach in experiments, we demonstrate improved similarities over previously reported GBS results for formic acid and identify the particular attributes that a molecule must exhibit for this, and other approximations, to be valid. These results highlight the importance in forming deeper connections between traditional methods and photonic approaches.</description>

      <title>A continuous-wave vacuum ultraviolet laser for the nuclear clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in $^{229}$Th at around 148.4 nm offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the realisation of a nuclear clock. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation of large ensembles of $^{229}$Th nuclei in transparent crystals and the development of pulsed vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) lasers, have enabled initial laser spectroscopy of this transition. However, the lack of an intense, narrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation. Here we introduce and demonstrate the first continuous-wave laser at 148.4 nm, generated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in cadmium vapor. The source delivers 100 nW of power with a linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength tunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth over all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm, marking a major advance in laser technology. We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique to place a stringent upper bound on the phase noise induced by the FWM process and demonstrate sub-hertz linewidth capability. These results eliminate the final technical hurdle to a $^{229}$Th-based nuclear clock, opening new directions in quantum metrology, nuclear quantum optics and precision tests of the Standard Model. More broadly, they establish a widely tunable, ultranarrow-linewidth laser platform for applications across quantum information science, condensed matter physics, and high-resolution VUV spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Investigation of Fundamental Mode Profiles in Monolithic Nonplanar Ring Oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonplanar ring oscillators (NPROs) are building blocks for high-performance single-frequency lasers and ring-laser gyroscopes that have profoundly improved the state-of-the-art laser technologies, fundamental research and precision measurements. However, a comprehensive investigation of fundamental mode profiles in monolithic NPROs has been a missing part even though they will affect the performance of the lasers or ring-laser gyroscopes. Here, we present a comprehensive finite-element modeling of the output beam profiles of monolithic NPROs by combining ABCD transmission matrix and generalized Huygens-Fresnel integral. We theoretically investigate the effects of geometric parameters of monolithic NPROs on their output mode profiles. In particular, we focus on the thermal effect inside the monolithic NPRO and calculate the equivalent focal-length of the thermal-lens by using a ray-tracing-method. Furthermore, we experimentally characterize the output laser beam profile, reconstruct the beam profile at the A-facet of the monolithic NPRO, and compare the experimental results with the simulation, thereby validating the accuracy and reliability of our model. The investigation may facilitate monolithic NPRO design and subsequently improve the performances of NPRO lasers and gyroscopes in the future.</description>

      <title>Temporal coupled mode theory for high-$Q$ resonances in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a coupled mode theory for resonant response from quasi-guided modes in periodic dielectric metasurfaces. First, we derived a generic set of constraints imposed onto the parameters of the temporal coupled mode theory by energy conservation and time-reversal symmetry in an invariant form that allows for asymmetry between the coupling and decoupling coefficients. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of Fano resonances induced by isolated quasi-guided modes in the regime of specular reflection. Our central result is a generic formula for the line-shape of the Fano resonance in transmittance for the lossless metasurfaces in the framework of 2D electrodynamics. We consider all possible symmetries of the metasurface elementary cell and uncover the effects that the symmetry incurs on the profile of the Fano resonance induced by an isolated high-$Q$ mode. It is shown that the proposed approach correctly describes the presence of robust reflection and transmission zeros in the spectra as well as the spectral signatures of bound states in the continuum. The approach is applied to uniderictionally guided resonant modes in metasurfaces with an asymmetric elementary cell. It is found that the existence of such modes and the transmittance in their spectral vicinity are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the theory predicts that a uniderictionally guided resonant mode is dual to a counter-propagating mode of a peculiar type which is coupled with the outgoing wave on both sides of the metasurface but, nonetheless, exhibits only a single-sided coupling with incident waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, SiNPs behave as harmonic oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with respect to motion of the SiNPs which can be explained by a theoretical model. Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to the spectra. Linear discriminant analysis detected differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. Random forest modeling provided further evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Inverse Design of Metasurfaces for Tailored Narrow Band Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces poses a considerable challenge because of the intricate interdependencies that exist between structural characteristics and electromagnetic responses. Traditional optimization methods require significant computational resources and frequently do not produce the most effective solutions. This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning approach known as Latent Style-based Quantum GAN (LaSt-QGAN). This method integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to enhance the optimization of metasurface designs aimed at achieving narrow-band absorption and unidirectionality. The proposed method results in a reduction of training time by 10X and a decrease in data requirements by 40X when compared to traditional GAN-based approaches. The produced metasurface designs demonstrate a high fidelity in relation to the target absorption spectra compared to the classical GAN based methods. Additionally, the integration of a material look-up table facilitates manufacturability by allowing for the substitution of predicted material properties with viable alternatives, all while preserving performance accuracy. Moreover the model is able to generate Q-factor upto the order of $10^4$, while the training dataset has Q-factor upto the order of $10^3$.</description>

      <title>Theoretical correction methods for optical tweezers: Acquisition of potentials of mean forces between colloidal particles in a bulk and on a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.10722v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that line optical tweezers (LOT) can measure potential of mean force (PMF) between colloidal particles in the bulk. However, PMF obtained with LOT is empirically modified before showing the result of the final form in order to correct the potential rise at long distances. In the present letter, we derive theoretical correction methods for acquisition of PMF by using statistical mechanics. Using the new methods, PMF can be obtained without the empirical fitting equation. Through the new methods, external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles induced by LOT can also be obtained. As an additional study, we explain two methods for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles on a substrate surface, in which a normal single optical tweezers with a fixed focal point is used, and for obtaining PMF between colloidal particles trapped by dual-beam optical tweezers in the bulk. These methods can also obtain the external potential acting on the trapped two colloidal particles.</description>

      <title>A versatile experimental method to measure the traction forces at interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a composite quantum system described by the tensor product of multiple systems each with a leading-order exceptional point (a non-Hermitian degeneracy at which not only eigenvalues but also eigenstates coalesce) exhibits a single leading-order exceptional point, whose order surpasses the order of any constituent exceptional point. The formation of such higher-order exceptional points does not require coupling among the subsystems. We determine explicitly the order and the spectral response strength of this exceptional point. Moreover, we observe that the energy eigenstates that do not merge are entangled. Finally, we demonstrate that general initial states disentangle during time evolution due to the presence of the higher-order exceptional point of the composite system.</description>

      <title>Improving Multislice Electron Ptychography with a Generative Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods.</description>
