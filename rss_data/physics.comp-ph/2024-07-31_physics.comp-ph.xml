      <title>Rapid Geological CO2 Storage Forecast and Optimization: A Data-driven Dynamic Mode Decomposition Model Order Reduction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DMDc and DMDspc successfully expedite the reconstruction and forecasting of CO2 fluid flow with acceptable accuracy margins, aiding in the rapid optimization of geological CO2 storage forecast and its optimization. DMDc and DMDspc models were trained with weekly, monthly, and yearly ECLIPSE 300 simulation pressure and CO2 saturation fields. The domain of interest is a large scale highly heterogeneous offshore reservoir model with over 100000 cells. Snapshot reconstruction significantly reduced simulation times from several hours to mere minutes. DMDspc reduced the number of DMD modes for pressure without losing accuracy while sometimes even improving accuracy. Two operation cases were considered: 1. CO2 injection, 2. CO2 injection and water production for pressure maintenance. For pressure, DMDspc achieved a slightly higher than DMDc average error by removing several modes. On the other hand, DMDspc showed limited success in reducing modes for CO2 saturation. The forecast performance of DMD models was evaluated using percent change error, mean absolute error, and Pearson R correlation coefficient metrics. Almost all DMD pressure models managed to successfully forecast pressure fields while a smaller number of DMD models managed to forecast CO2 saturation. While forecast errors have a considerable range, especially for saturation, only DMD models with errors below 5% PCE for pressure or 0.01 MAE for saturation were considered acceptable for geological CO2 storage optimization. Optimized CO2 injection and water production amounts were consistent across selected DMD models and all time scales. The DMDspc monitored cells approach, which only reconstructs the monitored during optimization cells, reduced even further optimization time while providing consistent results with the optimization that used full snapshot reconstruction.</description>

      <title>libEMMI_MGFD: A program of marine controlled-source electromagnetic modelling and inversion using frequency-domain multigrid solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20795v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a software package libEMMI\_MGFD for 3D frequency-domain marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) modelling and inversion. It is the first open-source C program tailored for geometrical multigrid (GMG) CSEM simulation. An volumetric anisotropic averaging scheme has been employed to compute effective medium for modelling over uniform and nonuniform grid. The computing coordinate is aligned with acquisition geometry by rotation with the azimuth and dip angles, facilitating the injection of the source and the extraction of data with arbitrary orientations. Efficient nonlinear optimization is achieved using quasi-Newton scheme assisted with bisection backtracking line search. In constructing the modularized Maxwell solver and evaluating the misfit and gradient for 3D CSEM inversion, the reverse communication technique is the key to the compaction of the software while maintaining the computational performance. A number of numeric tests demonstrate the efficiency of the modelling while preserving the solution accuracy. A 3D marine CSEM inversion example has been examined for resistivity imaging.</description>

      <title>Approximating electromagnetic fields in discontinuous media using a single physics-informed neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a new family of numerical methods, based on deep learning, for modeling boundary value problems. They offer an advantage over traditional numerical methods for high-dimensional, parametric, and data-driven problems. However, they perform poorly on problems where the solution exhibits high frequencies, such as discontinuities or sharp gradients. In this work, we develop a PINN-based solver for modeling three-dimensional, transient and static, parametric electromagnetic problems in discontinuous media. We use the first-order Maxwell's equations to train the neural network. We use a level-set function to represent the interface with a continuous function, and to enrich the network's inputs with high-frequencies and interface information. Finally, we validate the proposed methodology on multiple 3D, parametric, static, and transient problems.</description>

      <title>BMach: a Bayesian machine for optimizing Hubbard U parameters in DFT+U with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining the effective Hubbard parameter $(U_{eff})$ in Density Functional Theory plus U (DFT+U) remains a significant challenge, often relying on empirical methods or linear response theory, which frequently fail to predict accurate material properties. This study introduces BMach, an advanced Bayesian optimization algorithm that refines $U_{eff}$ by incorporating electronic properties, such as band gaps and eigenvalues, alongside structural properties like lattice parameters. Implemented within the Quantum Espresso platform, BMach demonstrates superior accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods. The BMach-optimized $U_{eff}$ values yield electronic properties that align closely with experimental and high-level theoretical results, providing a robust framework for high-throughput materials discovery and detailed electronic property characterization across diverse material systems.</description>

      <title>Carbon Nanotubes as a Basis of Metamaterials and Nanostructures: Crafting via Design Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanotruss structures made of carbon nanotubes are investigated in two conceptual applications: either as building blocks of metamaterials or for nanostructural applications. The nanotrusses are optimized for different purposes, including various loadings, boundary conditions, parameterizations, objectives and constraints used to formulate optimization problems. The procedure relies on a recently developed framework consisting of molecular dynamics simulations, neural networks and finite elements. This framework is now used in the design optimization of nanostructures and the performances of different popular heuristic optimization methods are compared. Five applications of nanotrusses made of carbon nanotubes are analyzed in detail to investigate the mechanical behavior of such structures and the efficiency of the optimizations. Besides an introductory example, the design of an energy trapping carbon nanotube nanotruss, an auxetic nanotruss, a cantilever nanotruss and the maximization of the compressive strength of a metamaterial are presented. It is shown that the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes can indeed be exploited for the development of structures and materials with extraordinary mechanical properties. Although hampered by material and geometrical nonlinearity of the problem, most of the tested optimization methods have proven to be a good choice for the design of such materials and structures.</description>

      <title>Venice: a multi-scale operator-splitting algorithm for multi-physics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present {\sc Venice}, an operator splitting algorithm to integrate a numerical model on a hierarchy of timescales. {\sc Venice} allows a wide variety of different physical processes operating a different scales to be coupled on individual and adaptive time-steps. It therewith mediates the development of complex multi-scale and multi-physics simulation environments with a wide variety of independent components. The coupling between various physical models and scales is dynamic, and realized through (Strang) operators splitting using adaptive time steps. We demonstrate the functionality and performance of this algorithm using astrophysical models of a stellar cluster, first coupling gravitational dynamics and stellar evolution, then coupling internal gravitational dynamics with dynamics within a galactic background potential, and finally combining these models while also introducing dwarf galaxy-like perturbers. These tests show numerical convergence for decreasing coupling timescales, demonstrate how {\sc Venice} can improve the performance of a simulation by shortening coupling timescales when appropriate, and provide a case study of how {\sc Venice} can be used to gradually build up and tune a complex multi-physics model. Although the examples couple complete numerical models, {\sc Venice} can also be used to efficiently solve systems of stiff differential equations.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Dielectric Response due to Domain Wall Motion in Ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) is a prototypical perovskite ferroelectric, whose dielectric permittivity and loss spectra -- which are strongly temperature and frequency dependent -- include contributions from inhomogeneous polarization patterns, with polar domain walls (DWs) being the most common types. In order to elucidate how DWs influence dielectric response, we utilized a continuum approach based on the Landau-Ginzburg theory to model field-dependent properties of polydomain tetragonal phase of BTO near room temperature and above. A system with 180$^\circ$ DWs was evaluated as a case study, with both position-resolved and volume-averaged dielectric susceptibility and loss computed at different temperatures for a range of applied field frequencies and amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that cooperative dipole fluctuations in the vicinity of the DW provide a large (extrinsic) contribution to the system dielectric response relative to the intrinsic contribution stemming from within the domain. Dynamics of the DW profile fluctuations under applied field can be represented by a combination of breathing and sliding vibrational motions, with each exhibiting distinct dependence on the field frequency and amplitude. The implications of this behavior are important for understanding and improving control of coupled functional properties in ferroelectric materials, including their dielectric, electromechanical, and electrooptical responses. Furthermore, this investigation provides a computational benchmark for future studies and can be readily extended to other topological polarization patterns in ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Unified Deep Learning Framework for Many-Body Quantum Chemistry via Green's Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body methods provide a systematic route to computing electronic properties of molecules and materials, but high computational costs restrict their use in large-scale applications. Due to the complexity in many-electron wavefunctions, machine learning models capable of capturing fundamental many-body physics remain limited. Here, we present a deep learning framework targeting the many-body Green's function, which unifies predictions of electronic properties in ground and excited states, while offering deep physical insights into electron correlation effects. By learning the $GW$ or coupled-cluster self-energy from mean-field features, our graph neural network achieves competitive performance in predicting one- and two-particle excitations and quantities derivable from one-particle density matrix. We demonstrate its high data efficiency and good transferability across chemical species, system sizes, molecular conformations, and correlation strengths in bond breaking, through multiple molecular and nanomaterial benchmarks. This work opens up new opportunities for utilizing machine learning to solve many-electron problems.</description>

      <title>Coupling 3D geodynamics and dynamic earthquake rupture: fault geometry, rheology and stresses across timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tectonic deformation crucially shapes the Earth's surface, with strain localization resulting in the formation of shear zones and faults that accommodate significant tectonic displacement. Earthquake dynamic rupture models, which provide valuable insights into earthquake mechanics and seismic ground motions, rely on initial conditions such as pre-stress states and fault geometry. However, these are often inadequately constrained due to observational limitations. To address these challenges, we develop a new method that loosely couples 3D geodynamic models to 3D dynamic rupture simulations, providing a mechanically consistent framework for earthquake analysis. Our approach does not prescribe fault geometry but derives it from the underlying lithospheric rheology and tectonic velocities using the medial axis transform. We perform three long-term geodynamics models of a strike-slip geodynamic system, each involving different continental crust rheology. We link these with nine dynamic rupture models, in which we investigate the role of varying fracture energy and plastic strain energy dissipation in the dynamic rupture behavior. These simulations suggest that for our fault, long-term rheology, and geodynamic system, a plausible critical linear slip weakening distance falls within Dc in [0.6,1.5]. Our results indicate that the long-term 3D stress field favors slip on fault segments better aligned with the regional plate motion and that minor variations in the long-term 3D stress field can strongly affect rupture dynamics, providing a physical mechanism for arresting earthquake propagation. Our geodynamically informed earthquake models highlight the need for detailed 3D fault modeling across time scales for a comprehensive understanding of earthquake mechanics.</description>

      <title>High-order limiting methods using maximum principle bounds derived from the Boltzmann equation I: Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of limiting methods for high-order numerical approximations of hyperbolic conservation laws generally requires defining an admissible region/bounds for the solution. In this work, we present a novel approach for computing solution bounds and limiting for the Euler equations through the kinetic representation provided by the Boltzmann equation, which allows for extending limiters designed for linear advection directly to the Euler equations. Given an arbitrary set of solution values to compute bounds over (e.g., numerical stencil) and a desired linear advection limiter, the proposed approach yields an analytic expression for the admissible region of particle distribution function values, which may be numerically integrated to yield a set of bounds for the density, momentum, and total energy. These solution bounds are shown to preserve positivity of density/pressure/internal energy and, when paired with a limiting technique, can robustly resolve strong discontinuities while recovering high-order accuracy in smooth regions without any ad hoc corrections (e.g., relaxing the bounds). This approach is demonstrated in the context of an explicit unstructured high-order discontinuous Galerkin/flux reconstruction scheme for a variety of difficult problems in gas dynamics, including cases with extreme shocks and shock-vortex interactions. Furthermore, this work presents a foundation for limiting techniques for more complex macroscopic governing equations that can be derived from an underlying kinetic representation for which admissible solution bounds are not well-understood.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Multi-material Classification of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for the data-driven design of materials based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other scanning probe microscopy. These tools enhance efficiency in inverse design and characterization of materials. However, limited and imbalanced experimental materials data typically available is a major challenge. Also important is the need to interpret trained models, which have typically been complex enough to be uninterpretable by humans. Here, we present a systemic evaluation of transfer learning strategies to accommodate low-data scenarios in materials synthesis and a model latent feature analysis to draw connections to the human-interpretable characteristics of the samples. Our models show accurate predictions in five classes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and Mo-WSe$_2$) with up to 89$\%$ accuracy on held-out test samples. Analysis of the latent features reveals a correlation with physical characteristics such as grain density, DoG blob, and local variation. The transfer learning optimization modality and the exploration of the correlation between the latent and physical features provide important frameworks that can be applied to other classes of materials beyond TMDs to enhance the models' performance and explainability which can accelerate the inverse design of materials for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Cartesian atomic cluster expansion for machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials are revolutionizing large-scale, accurate atomistic modelling in material science and chemistry. Many potentials use atomic cluster expansion or equivariant message passing frameworks. Such frameworks typically use spherical harmonics as angular basis functions, and then use Clebsch-Gordan contraction to maintain rotational symmetry, which may introduce redundancies in representations and computational overhead. We propose an alternative: a Cartesian-coordinates-based atomic density expansion. This approach provides a complete set of polynormially indepedent features of atomic environments while maintaining interaction body orders. Additionally, we integrate low-dimensional embeddings of various chemical elements and inter-atomic message passing. The resulting potential, named Cartesian Atomic Cluster Expansion (CACE), exhibits good accuracy, stability, and generalizability. We validate its performance in diverse systems, including bulk water, small molecules, and 25-element high-entropy alloys.</description>

      <title>Multi-GPU RI-HF Energies and Analytic Gradients $-$ Towards High Throughput Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents an optimized algorithm and implementation for calculating resolution-of-the-identity Hartree-Fock (RI-HF) energies and analytic gradients using multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The algorithm is especially designed for high throughput \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations of small and medium size molecules (10-100 atoms). Key innovations of this work include the exploitation of multi-GPU parallelism and a workload balancing scheme that efficiently distributes computational tasks among GPUs. Our implementation also employs techniques for symmetry utilization, integral screening and leveraging sparsity to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. Computational results show that the implementation achieves significant performance improvements, including over $3\times$ speedups in single GPU AIMD throughput compared to previous GPU-accelerated RI-HF and traditional HF methods. Furthermore, utilizing multiple GPUs can provide super-linear speedup when the additional aggregate GPU memory allows for the storage of decompressed three-center integrals. Additionally, we report strong scaling efficiencies for systems up to 1000 basis functions and demonstrate practical applications through extensive performance benchmarks on up to quadruple-$\zeta$ primary basis sets, achieving floating-point performance of up to 47\% of the theoretical peak on a 4$\times$A100 GPU node.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spintronic devices offer a promising avenue for the development of nanoscale, energy-efficient artificial neurons for neuromorphic computing. It has previously been shown that with antiferromagnetic (AFM) oscillators, ultra-fast spiking artificial neurons can be made that mimic many unique features of biological neurons. In this work, we train an artificial neural network of AFM neurons to perform pattern recognition. A simple machine learning algorithm called spike pattern association neuron (SPAN), which relies on the temporal position of neuron spikes, is used during training. In under a microsecond of physical time, the AFM neural network is trained to recognize symbols composed from a grid by producing a spike within a specified time window. We further achieve multi-symbol recognition with the addition of an output layer to suppress undesirable spikes. Through the utilization of AFM neurons and the SPAN algorithm, we create a neural network capable of high-accuracy recognition with overall power consumption on the order of picojoules.</description>

Abstract: An issue for molecular dynamics simulations is that events of interest often involve timescales that are much longer than the simulation time step, which is set by the fastest timescales of the model. Because of this timescale separation, direct simulation of many events is prohibitively computationally costly. This issue can be overcome by aggregating information from many relatively short simulations that sample segments of trajectories involving events of interest. This is the strategy of Markov state models (MSMs) and related approaches, but such methods suffer from approximation error because the variables defining the states generally do not capture the dynamics fully. By contrast, once converged, the weighted ensemble (WE) method aggregates information from trajectory segments so as to yield unbiased estimates of both thermodynamic and kinetic statistics. Unfortunately, errors decay no faster than unbiased simulation in WE. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for describing WE that shows that introduction of an approximate stationary distribution on top of the stratification, as in nonequilibrium umbrella sampling (NEUS), accelerates convergence. Building on ideas from MSMs and related methods, we generalize the NEUS approach in such a way that the approximation error can be reduced systematically. We show that the improved algorithm can decrease simulation times required to achieve a desired precision by orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Understanding plasma instabilities is essential for achieving sustainable fusion energy, with large-scale plasma simulations playing a crucial role in both the design and development of next-generation fusion energy devices and the modelling of industrial plasmas. To achieve sustainable fusion energy, it is essential to accurately model and predict plasma behavior under extreme conditions, requiring sophisticated simulation codes capable of capturing the complex interaction between plasma dynamics, magnetic fields, and material surfaces. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive HPC analysis of two prominent plasma simulation codes, BIT1 and JOREK, to advance understanding of plasma behavior in fusion energy applications. Our focus is on evaluating JOREK's computational efficiency and scalability for simulating non-linear MHD phenomena in tokamak fusion devices. The motivation behind this work stems from the urgent need to advance our understanding of plasma instabilities in magnetically confined fusion devices. Enhancing JOREK's performance on supercomputers improves fusion plasma code predictability, enabling more accurate modelling and faster optimization of fusion designs, thereby contributing to sustainable fusion energy. In prior studies, we analysed BIT1, a massively parallel Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code for studying plasma-material interactions in fusion devices. Our investigations into BIT1's computational requirements and scalability on advanced supercomputing architectures yielded valuable insights. Through detailed profiling and performance analysis, we have identified the primary bottlenecks and implemented optimization strategies, significantly enhancing parallel performance. This previous work serves as a foundation for our present endeavours.</description>
