      <title>Gradient-enhanced sparse Hermite polynomial expansions for pricing and hedging high-dimensional American options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient and easy-to-implement gradient-enhanced least squares Monte Carlo method for computing price and Greeks (i.e., derivatives of the price function) of high-dimensional American options. It employs the sparse Hermite polynomial expansion as a surrogate model for the continuation value function, and essentially exploits the fast evaluation of gradients. The expansion coefficients are computed by solving a linear least squares problem that is enhanced by gradient information of simulated paths. We analyze the convergence of the proposed method, and establish an error estimate in terms of the best approximation error in the weighted $H^1$ space, the statistical error of solving discrete least squares problems, and the time step size. We present comprehensive numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art least squares Monte Carlo method with more accurate price, Greeks, and optimal exercise strategies in high dimensions but with nearly identical computational cost, and it can deliver comparable results with recent neural network-based methods up to dimension 100.</description>

      <title>Modelling Opaque Bilateral Market Dynamics in Financial Trading: Insights from a Multi-Agent Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring complex adaptive financial trading environments through multi-agent based simulation methods presents an innovative approach within the realm of quantitative finance. Despite the dominance of multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches in financial markets with observable data, there exists a set of systematically significant financial markets that pose challenges due to their partial or obscured data availability. We, therefore, devise a multi-agent simulation approach employing small-scale meta-heuristic methods. This approach aims to represent the opaque bilateral market for Australian government bond trading, capturing the bilateral nature of bank-to-bank trading, also referred to as "over-the-counter" (OTC) trading, and commonly occurring between "market makers". The uniqueness of the bilateral market, characterized by negotiated transactions and a limited number of agents, yields valuable insights for agent-based modelling and quantitative finance. The inherent rigidity of this market structure, which is at odds with the global proliferation of multilateral platforms and the decentralization of finance, underscores the unique insights offered by our agent-based model. We explore the implications of market rigidity on market structure and consider the element of stability, in market design. This extends the ongoing discourse on complex financial trading environments, providing an enhanced understanding of their dynamics and implications.</description>

      <title>A weighted multilevel Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method has been applied successfully in a wide range of settings since its first introduction by Giles (2008). When using only two levels, the method can be viewed as a kind of control-variate approach to reduce variance, as earlier proposed by Kebaier (2005). We introduce a generalization of the MLMC formulation by extending this control variate approach to any number of levels and deriving a recursive formula for computing the weights associated with the control variates and the optimal numbers of samples at the various levels.
  We also show how the generalisation can also be applied to the \emph{multi-index} MLMC method of Haji-Ali, Nobile, Tempone (2015), at the cost of solving a $(2^d-1)$-dimensional minimisation problem at each node when $d$ index dimensions are used.
  The comparative performance of the weighted MLMC method is illustrated in a range of numerical settings. While the addition of weights does not change the \emph{asymptotic} complexity of the method, the results show that significant efficiency improvements over the standard MLMC formulation are possible, particularly when the coarse level approximations are poorly correlated.</description>

      <title>The Democratization of Wealth Management: Hedged Mutual Fund Blockchain Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop several innovations designed to bring the best practices of traditional investment funds to the blockchain landscape. Our innovations combine the superior mechanisms of mutual funds and hedge funds. Specifically, we illustrate how fund prices can be updated regularly like mutual funds and performance fees can be charged like hedge funds. We show how mutually hedged blockchain investment funds can operate with investor protection schemes - high water marks - and measures to offset trading slippage when redemptions happen. We provide detailed steps - including mathematical formulations and instructive pointers - to implement these ideas as blockchain smart contracts. We discuss how our designs overcome several blockchain bottlenecks and how we can make smart contracts smarter. We provide numerical illustrations of several scenarios related to the mechanisms we have tailored for blockchain implementation.
  The concepts we have developed for blockchain implementation can also be useful in traditional financial funds to calculate performance fees in a simplified manner. We highlight two main issues with the operation of mutual funds and hedge funds and show how blockchain technology can alleviate those concerns. The ideas developed here illustrate on one hand, how blockchain can solve many issues faced by the traditional world and on the other hand, how many innovations from traditional finance can benefit decentralized finance and speed its adoption. This becomes an example of symbiosis between decentralized and traditional finance - bringing these two realms closer and breaking down barriers between such artificial distinctions - wherein the future will be about providing better risk adjusted wealth appreciation opportunities to end customers through secure, reliable, accessible and transparent services - without getting too caught up about how such services are being rendered.</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Network Approximation of Transition Densities in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces FourNet, a novel single-layer feed-forward neural network (FFNN) method designed to approximate transition densities for which closed-form expressions of their Fourier transforms, i.e. characteristic functions, are available. A unique feature of FourNet lies in its use of a Gaussian activation function, enabling exact Fourier and inverse Fourier transformations and drawing analogies with the Gaussian mixture model. We mathematically establish FourNet's capacity to approximate transition densities in the $L_2$-sense arbitrarily well with finite number of neurons. The parameters of FourNet are learned by minimizing a loss function derived from the known characteristic function and the Fourier transform of the FFNN, complemented by a strategic sampling approach to enhance training. We derive practical bounds for the $L_2$ estimation error and the potential pointwise loss of nonnegativity in FourNet, highlighting its robustness and applicability in practical settings. FourNet's accuracy and versatility are demonstrated through a wide range of dynamics common in quantitative finance, including L\'{e}vy processes and the Heston stochastic volatility models-including those augmented with the self-exciting Queue-Hawkes jump process.</description>

      <title>Emoji Driven Crypto Assets Market Reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrency, social media platforms like Twitter have become pivotal in influencing market trends and investor sentiments. In our study, we leverage GPT-4 and a fine-tuned transformer-based BERT model for a multimodal sentiment analysis, focusing on the impact of emoji sentiment on cryptocurrency markets. By translating emojis into quantifiable sentiment data, we correlate these insights with key market indicators like BTC Price and the VCRIX index. Our architecture's analysis of emoji sentiment demonstrated a distinct advantage over FinBERT's pure text sentiment analysis in such predicting power. This approach may be fed into the development of trading strategies aimed at utilizing social media elements to identify and forecast market trends. Crucially, our findings suggest that strategies based on emoji sentiment can facilitate the avoidance of significant market downturns and contribute to the stabilization of returns. This research underscores the practical benefits of integrating advanced AI-driven analyses into financial strategies, offering a nuanced perspective on the interplay between digital communication and market dynamics in an academic context.</description>

      <title>Multiarmed Bandits Problem Under the Mean-Variance Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem involves a learner and a collection of K independent arms, each with its own ex ante unknown independent reward distribution. At each one of a finite number of rounds, the learner selects one arm and receives new information. The learner often faces an exploration-exploitation dilemma: exploiting the current information by playing the arm with the highest estimated reward versus exploring all arms to gather more reward information. The design objective aims to maximize the expected cumulative reward over all rounds. However, such an objective does not account for a risk-reward tradeoff, which is often a fundamental precept in many areas of applications, most notably in finance and economics. In this paper, we build upon Sani et al. (2012) and extend the classical MAB problem to a mean-variance setting. Specifically, we relax the assumptions of independent arms and bounded rewards made in Sani et al. (2012) by considering sub-Gaussian arms. We introduce the Risk Aware Lower Confidence Bound (RALCB) algorithm to solve the problem, and study some of its properties. Finally, we perform a number of numerical simulations to demonstrate that, in both independent and dependent scenarios, our suggested approach performs better than the algorithm suggested by Sani et al. (2012).</description>
