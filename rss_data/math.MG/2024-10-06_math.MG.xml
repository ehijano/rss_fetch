      <title>On the intersection of fractal cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the intersections of fractal k-cubes of order n and intersections of their respective opposite l-faces. The main result of the paper is the theorem on representation of such intersection as the attractor of a graph-directed system of similarities in terms of the sets of units corresponding to these cubes and intersections of pairs of l-faces. As a corollary, we prove dimension formula for the intersection and the condition of finiteness of its measure. Another corollary gives the conditions under which the intersections have the given cardinality. Applying these techniques, we obtain the conditions under which a fractal k-cube has the finite intersection property and the conditions under which the fractal cube is a dendrite.</description>

      <title>Box dimension of fractal functions on attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a wide class of fractal interpolation functions in a single platform by considering the domains of these functions as general attractors. We obtain lower and upper bounds of the box dimension of these functions in a more general setup where the interpolation points need not be equally spaced, the scale vectors can be variables and the maps in the corresponding IFS can be non-affine. In particular, we obtain the exact value of the box dimension of non-affine fractal functions on general m-dimensional cubes and Sierpinski Gasket.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Marstrand's theorem and some geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.09965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove using quite elementary methods, with a combinatorial nature, two general results related to Marstrand's projection theorem in a quite general formulation over metric spaces under a suitable transversality condition (the "projections" are in principle only continuous, and the transversality condition gives flexibility in exponents) - the result is flexible enough to, in particular, recover most of the classical Marstrand-like theorems. We also give some new geometrical applications of our results - one of them is a new result related to Falconer's distance conjecture.</description>

      <title>Comparison Results for Gromov-Wasserstein and Gromov-Monge Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kantorovich formulation of optimal transport distance between probability measures on a metric space, Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances comprise a family of metrics on the space of isomorphism classes of metric measure spaces. In previous work, the authors introduced a variant of this construction which was inspired by the original Monge formulation of optimal transport; elements of the resulting family are referred to Gromov-Monge (GM) distances. These GM distances, and related ideas, have since become a subject of interest from both theoretical and applications-oriented perspectives. In this note, we establish several theoretical properties of GM distances, focusing on comparisons between GM and GW distances. In particular, we show that GM and GW distances are equal for non-atomic metric measure spaces. We also consider variants of GM distance, such as a Monge version of Sturm's $L_p$-transportion distance, and give precise comparisons to GW distance. Finally, we establish bi-H\"{o}lder equivalence between GM distance and an isometry-invariant Monge optimal transport distance between Euclidean metric measure spaces that has been utilized in shape and image analysis applications.</description>

      <title>Continuity of extensions of Lipschitz maps and of monotone maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a subset of a Hilbert space. We prove that if $v\colon X\to \mathbb{R}^m$ is such that \begin{equation*}
  \Big\lVert v(x)-\sum_{i=1}^m t_iv(x_i)\Big\rVert\leq \Big\lVert x-\sum_{i=1}^m t_ix_i\Big\rVert \end{equation*} for all $x,x_1,\dotsc,x_m\in\mathbb{R}^m$ and all non-negative $t_1,\dotsc,t_m$ that add up to one, then for any $1$-Lipschitz $u\colon A\to\mathbb{R}^m$, with $A\subset X$, there exists a $1$-Lipschitz extension $\tilde{u}\colon X\to\mathbb{R}^m$ of $u$ such that the uniform distance on $X$ between $\tilde{u}$ and $v$ is the same as the uniform distance on $A$ between $u$ and $v$.
  Moreover, if either $m\in \{1,2,3\}$ or $X$ is convex, we prove the converse: we show that a map $v\colon X\to\mathbb{R}^m$ that allows for a $1$-Lipschitz, uniform distance preserving extension of any $1$-Lipschitz map on a subset of $X$ also satisfies the above set of inequalities.
  We also prove a similar continuity result concerning extensions of monotone maps.
  Our results hold true also for maps taking values in infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>
