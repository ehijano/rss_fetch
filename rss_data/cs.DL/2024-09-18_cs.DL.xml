      <title>Evaluating the Linguistic Coverage of OpenAlex: An Assessment of Metadata Accuracy and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clarivate's Web of Science (WoS) and Elsevier's Scopus have been for decades the main sources of bibliometric information. Although highly curated, these closed, proprietary databases are largely biased towards English-language publications, underestimating the use of other languages in research dissemination. Launched in 2022, OpenAlex promised comprehensive, inclusive, and open-source research information. While already in use by scholars and research institutions, the quality of its metadata is currently being assessed. This paper contributes to this literature by assessing the completeness and accuracy of its metadata related to language, through a comparison with WoS, as well as an in-depth manual validation of a sample of 6,836 articles. Results show that OpenAlex exhibits a far more balanced linguistic coverage than WoS. However, language metadata is not always accurate, which leads OpenAlex to overestimate the place of English while underestimating that of other languages. If used critically, OpenAlex can provide comprehensive and representative analyses of languages used for scholarly publishing. However, more work is needed at infrastructural level to ensure the quality of metadata on language.</description>

      <title>Research evolution of metal organic frameworks: A scientometric approach with human-in-the-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on a scientometric analysis bolstered by human in the loop, domain experts, to examine the field of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) research. Scientometric analyses reveal the intellectual landscape of a field. The study engaged MOF scientists in the design and review of our research workflow. MOF materials are an essential component in next generation renewable energy storage and biomedical technologies. The research approach demonstrates how engaging experts, via human in the loop processes, can help develop a comprehensive view of a field research trends, influential works, and specialized topics.</description>

      <title>Semantic Information Management in Low-Temperature Plasma Science and Technology with VIVO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital research data management is increasingly integrated across universities and research institutions, addressing the handling of research data throughout its lifecycle according to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Recent emphasis on the semantic and interlinking aspects of research data, e.g., by using ontologies and knowledge graphs further enhances findability and reusability. This work presents a framework for creating and maintaining a knowledge graph specifically for low-temperature plasma (LTP) science and technology. The framework leverages a domain-specific ontology called Plasma-O, along with the VIVO software as a platform for semantic information management in LTP research. While some research fields are already prepared to use ontologies and knowledge graphs for information management, their application in LTP research is nascent. This work aims to bridge this gap by providing a framework that not only improves research data management but also fosters community participation in building the domain-specific ontology and knowledge graph based on the published materials. The results may also support other research fields in the practical use of knowledge graphs for semantic information management.</description>
