      <title>Conformal Lesion Segmentation for 3D Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation serves as a critical component of precision medicine, enabling accurate localization and delineation of pathological regions, such as lesions. However, existing models empirically apply fixed thresholds (e.g., 0.5) to differentiate lesions from the background, offering no statistical guarantees on key metrics such as the false negative rate (FNR). This lack of principled risk control undermines their reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical applications, especially in challenging scenarios like 3D lesion segmentation (3D-LS). To address this issue, we propose a risk-constrained framework, termed Conformal Lesion Segmentation (CLS), that calibrates data-driven thresholds via conformalization to ensure the test-time FNR remains below a target tolerance $\varepsilon$ under desired risk levels. CLS begins by holding out a calibration set to analyze the threshold setting for each sample under the FNR tolerance, drawing on the idea of conformal prediction. We define an FNR-specific loss function and identify the critical threshold at which each calibration data point just satisfies the target tolerance. Given a user-specified risk level $\alpha$, we then determine the approximate $1-\alpha$ quantile of all the critical thresholds in the calibration set as the test-time confidence threshold. By conformalizing such critical thresholds, CLS generalizes the statistical regularities observed in the calibration set to new test data, providing rigorous FNR constraint while yielding more precise and reliable segmentations. We validate the statistical soundness and predictive performance of CLS on six 3D-LS datasets across five backbone models, and conclude with actionable insights for deploying risk-aware segmentation in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>TriggerNet: A Novel Explainable AI Framework for Red Palm Mite Detection and Multi-Model Comparison and Heuristic-Guided Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise, Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree, and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification, all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation time and improving dataset reliability.</description>

      <title>Quantification of dual-state 5-ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence: Methodology and validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantification of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence in human brain tumours has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in neuro-oncology, but represents a formidable imaging challenge. Protoporphyrin is a biological molecule which interacts with the tissue micro-environment to form two photochemical states in glioma. Each exhibits markedly different quantum efficiencies, with distinct but overlapping emission spectra that also overlap with tissue autofluorescence. Fluorescence emission is known to be distorted by the intrinsic optical properties of tissue, coupled with marked intra-tumoural heterogeneity as a hallmark of glioma tumours. Existing quantitative fluorescence systems are developed and validated using simplified phantoms that do not simultaneously mimic the complex interactions between fluorophores and tissue optical properties or micro-environment. Consequently, existing systems risk introducing systematic errors into PpIX quantification when used in tissue. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline for quantification of PpIX in glioma, which robustly differentiates both emission states from background autofluorescence without reliance on a priori spectral information, and accounts for variations in their quantum efficiency. Unmixed PpIX emission forms are then corrected for wavelength-dependent optical distortions and weighted for accurate quantification. Significantly, this pipeline is developed and validated using novel tissue-mimicking phantoms replicating the optical properties of glioma tissues and photochemical variability of PpIX fluorescence in glioma. Our workflow achieves strong correlation with ground-truth PpIX concentrations (R2 = 0.918+-0.002), demonstrating its potential for robust, quantitative PpIX fluorescence imaging in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>DeLoad: Demand-Driven Short-Video Preloading with Scalable Watch-Time Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short video streaming has become a dominant paradigm in digital media, characterized by rapid swiping interactions and diverse media content. A key technical challenge is designing an effective preloading strategy that dynamically selects and prioritizes download tasks from an evolving playlist, balancing Quality of Experience (QoE) and bandwidth efficiency under practical commercial constraints. However, real world analysis reveals critical limitations of existing approaches: (1) insufficient adaptation of download task sizes to dynamic conditions, and (2) watch time prediction models that are difficult to deploy reliably at scale. In this paper, we propose DeLoad, a novel preloading framework that addresses these issues by introducing dynamic task sizing and a practical, multi dimensional watch time estimation method. Additionally, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enhanced agent is trained to optimize the download range decisions adaptively. Extensive evaluations conducted on an offline testing platform, leveraging massive real world network data, demonstrate that DeLoad achieves significant improvements in QoE metrics (34.4% to 87.4% gain). Furthermore, after deployment on a large scale commercial short video platform, DeLoad has increased overall user watch time by 0.09% while simultaneously reducing rebuffering events and 3.76% bandwidth consumption.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Vector Quantization for Robust Semantic Communication on Discrete Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic communication has largely relied on analog or semi-digital transmission, which limits compatibility with modern digital communication infrastructures. Recent studies have employed vector quantization (VQ) to enable discrete semantic transmission, yet existing methods neglect channel state information during codebook optimization, leading to suboptimal robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a channel-aware vector quantization (CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, termed VQJSCC, established on a discrete memoryless channel. In this framework, semantic features are discretized and directly mapped to modulation constellation symbols, while CAVQ integrates channel transition probabilities into the quantization process, aligning easily confused symbols with semantically similar codewords. A multi-codebook alignment mechanism is further introduced to handle mismatches between codebook order and modulation order by decomposing the transmission stream into multiple independently optimized subchannels. Experimental results demonstrate that VQJSCC effectively mitigates the digital cliff effect, achieves superior reconstruction quality across various modulation schemes, and outperforms state-of-the-art digital semantic communication baselines in both robustness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>PIRA: Pan-CDN Intra-video Resource Adaptation for Short Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In large scale short video platforms, CDN resource selection plays a critical role in maintaining Quality of Experience (QoE) while controlling escalating traffic costs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct in the wild network measurements during video playback in a production short video system. The results reveal that CDNs delivering higher average QoE often come at greater financial cost, yet their connection quality fluctuates even within a single video underscoring a fundamental and dynamic trade off between QoE and cost. However, the problem of sustaining high QoE under cost constraints remains insufficiently investigated in the context of CDN selection for short video streaming. To address this, we propose PIRA, a dynamic resource selection algorithm that optimizes QoE and cost in real time during video playback. PIRA formally integrating QoE and cost by a mathematical model, and introduce a intra video control theoretic CDN resource selection approach which can balance QoE and cost under network dynamics. To reduce the computation overheads, PIRA employs state space pruning and adaptive parameter adjustment to efficiently solve the high dimensional optimization problem. In large scale production experiments involving 450,000 users over two weeks, PIRA outperforms the production baseline, achieving a 2.1% reduction in start up delay, 15.2% shorter rebuffering time, and 10% lower average unit traffic cost, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing user experience and financial cost at scale.</description>

      <title>RWKV-UNet: Improving UNet with Long-Range Cooperation for Effective Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements have been made in deep learning for medical image segmentation, particularly with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models. However, CNNs face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer from high computational complexity. To address this, we propose RWKV-UNet, a novel model that integrates the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) structure into the U-Net architecture. This integration enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and to improve contextual understanding, which is crucial for accurate medical image segmentation. We build a strong encoder with developed Global-Local Spatial Perception (GLSP) blocks combining CNNs and RWKVs. We also propose a Cross-Channel Mix (CCM) module to improve skip connections with multi-scale feature fusion, achieving global channel information integration. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that the RWKV-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on various types of medical image segmentation tasks. Additionally, smaller variants, RWKV-UNet-S and RWKV-UNet-T, balance accuracy and computational efficiency, making them suitable for broader clinical applications.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for White Matter Shape Prediction in Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.</description>

      <title>Regression is all you need for medical image translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved impressive results in natural image synthesis, their core strengths - creativity and realism - can be detrimental in medical applications, where accuracy and fidelity are paramount. These models instead risk introducing hallucinations and replication of unwanted acquisition noise. Here, we propose YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a 2.5D diffusion-based framework for medical image translation (MIT). Consistent with DM theory, we find that conventional diffusion sampling stochastically replicates noise. To mitigate this, we draw and average multiple samples, akin to physical signal averaging. As this effectively approximates the DM's expected value, we term this Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) sampling. We additionally propose regression sampling YODA, which retains the initial DM prediction and omits iterative refinement to produce noise-free images in a single step. Across five diverse multi-modal datasets - including multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we demonstrate that regression sampling is not only substantially more efficient but also matches or exceeds image quality of full diffusion sampling even with ExpA. Our results reveal that iterative refinement solely enhances perceptual realism without benefiting information translation, which we confirm in relevant downstream tasks. YODA outperforms eight state-of-the-art DMs and GANs and challenges the presumed superiority of DMs and GANs over computationally cheap regression models for high-quality MIT. Furthermore, we show that YODA-translated images are interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several medical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate cortical surface reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is crucial for reliable neuroanatomical analyses. Current methods have to contend with complex cortical geometries, strict topological requirements, and often produce surfaces with overlaps, self-intersections, and topological defects. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces (left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while preserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into a nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate subject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve as precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic deformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via scaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving transformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and self-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex dramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing current methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.</description>

      <title>Adapting Medical Vision Foundation Models for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation via Active Learning and Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD) and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from unqueried ones.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Learning with Synthetic Data for Enhanced Pulmonary Nodule Detection in Chest Radiographs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size, brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/- 11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images. Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC). Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89 for the baseline (p &lt; 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs. 48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard). Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule detection.</description>

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design. In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's robustness to hyperparameter variations.</description>

      <title>Computer Navigated Spinal Surgery Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Augmented Reality</title>

Abstract: Current spinal pain management procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and epidural steroid injection (ESI), rely on fluoroscopy for needle placement which exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation. In this paper, we investigate a radiation-free surgical navigation system for spinal pain management procedures that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fiducial ArUco marker-based augmented reality (AR). High-resolution MRI scans of a lumbar spinal phantom were obtained and assembled as a surface mesh. Laplacian smoothing algorithms were then applied to smoothen the surface and improve the model fidelity. A commercially available stereo camera (ZED2) was used to track single or dual fiducial ArUco markers on the patient to determine the patient's real-time pose. Custom AR software was applied to overlay the MRI image onto the patient, allowing the physician to see not only the outer surface of the patient but also the complete anatomy of the patient below the surface. Needle-insertion trials on a 3D-printed 3-vertebra phantom showed that dual-ArUco marker tracking increased the accuracy of needle insertions and reduced the average needle misplacement distance compared to single-ArUco marker procedures. The average needle misplacement is comparable to the average deviation of 2 mm for conventional epidural techniques using fluoroscopy. Our radiation-free system demonstrates promise to serve as an alternative to fluoroscopy by improving image-guided spinal navigation.</description>

      <title>GreenHyperSpectra: A multi-source hyperspectral dataset for global vegetation trait prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However, conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods. Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment.
