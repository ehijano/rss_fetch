      <title>Transition region response to Quiet Sun Ellerman Bombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quiet Sun Ellerman Bombs (QSEBs) are key indicators of small-scale photospheric magnetic reconnection events. Recent high-resolution observations have shown that they are ubiquitous and that large numbers of QSEBs can be found in the quiet Sun. We aim to understand the impact of QSEBs on the upper solar atmosphere by analysing their spatial and temporal relationship with the UV brightenings observed in transition region diagnostics. We analyse high-resolution H-beta observations from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and utilise k-means clustering to detect 1423 QSEBs in a 51 min time series. We use coordinated and co-aligned observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) to search for corresponding signatures in the 1400 A slit-jaw image (SJI) channel and in the Si IV 1394 A and Mg II 2798.8 A triplet spectral lines. We identify UV brightenings from SJI 1400 using a threshold of 5$\sigma$ above the median background. We focused on 453 long-lived QSEBs ($&gt;1$ min) and found 67 cases of UV brightenings from SJI 1400 occurring near the QSEBs, both temporally and spatially. Temporal analysis of these events indicates that QSEBs start before UV brightenings in 57 % of cases, while UV brightenings lead in 36 % of instances. The majority of the UV brightenings occur within 1000 km from the QSEBs in the direction of the solar limb. We also identify 21 QSEBs covered by the IRIS slit, with 4 of them showing emissions in both or one of the Si IV 1394 A and Mg II 2798.8 A triplet lines, at distances within 500 km from the QSEBs in the limb direction. We conclude that a small fraction (15 %) of the long-lived QSEBs contribute to localized heating observable in transition region diagnostics, indicating a minimal role in the global heating of the upper solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and the characteristics of circumstellar discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of circumstellar discs (CDs) produced in hydrodynamical simulations of gravoturbulent core collapse considering Kolmogorov and Burger-type turbulence. We report that massive discs are more prevalent in the Kolmogorov regime than for Burger-type turbulence. A significant number of discs are formed with a radius of $\sim$ 15 au in both cases. However, the number of extended discs with radii $&gt;$ 15 au is significantly larger in case of Kolmogorov turbulence. The two regimes of turbulence, in general, yield disc radii in the ranges of 7 au $-$ 30 au, and 13 au $-$ 39 au, respectively. The corresponding ranges of the disc masses are 30.37 $M_{\rm Jup}$ $-$ 0.92 M$_{\odot}$, and 2.09 $M_{\rm Jup}$ $-$ 0.13 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. Moreover, the ratio $M_{\rm disc}$/$M_{\rm star}$ is higher in models of Kolmogorov-type turbulence than in models of Burgers-type turbulence. We do not find any correlation between $R_{\rm disc}$ and $M_{\rm disc}$ over the explored range of initial temperatures (8 K $-$ 14 K) and the type of turbulence. Also, for these initial thermal variations, the turbulent circumstellar disc structures do not exhibit signs of turbulent diffusion. Nonetheless, both sub and supersonic velocity dispersions cause variations in the specific angular momentum (AM) of infalling gas, especially for CDs with radii $\sim$ 16 au $-$ 21 au. The radial profiles of CDs do not correlate with the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Age and Stellar Model Choice on Globular Cluster Color-to-Metallicity Conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photometric colors of globular clusters (GCs) act as effective proxies for metallicity, since all normally used optical/IR color indices exhibit a nonlinear but monotonic relation between their integrated color and their metallicity. One color index, (g - z) or (F475W - F850LP), has been spectroscopically calibrated in several studies, providing leverage to define color-to-metallicity conversions for other indices. In this paper, building on the work of arXiv:2307.01863, we study the GC color-metallicity relation in more detail by testing the dependence of the relations on different suites of stellar models and different assumed GC ages. Though noticeable differences between models exist, we find that the net effect on the derived GCS metallicity distributions is small.</description>

      <title>Simulating Brown Dwarf Observations for Various Mass Functions, Birthrates, and Low-mass Cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After decades of brown dwarf discovery and follow-up, we can now infer the functional form of the mass distribution within 20 parsecs, which serves as a constraint on star formation theory at the lowest masses. Unlike objects on the main sequence that have a clear luminosity-to-mass correlation, brown dwarfs lack a correlation between an observable parameter (luminosity, spectral type, or color) and mass. A measurement of the brown dwarf mass function must therefore be procured through proxy measurements and theoretical models. We utilize various assumed forms of the mass function, together with a variety of birthrate functions, low-mass cutoffs, and theoretical evolutionary models, to build predicted forms of the effective temperature distribution. We then determine the best fit of the observed effective temperature distribution to these predictions, which in turn reveals the most likely mass function. We find that a simple power law ($dN/dM \propto M^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha \approx 0.5$ is optimal. Additionally, we conclude that the low-mass cutoff for star formation is $\lesssim0.005M_{\odot}$. We corroborate the findings of Burgasser (2004) which state that the birthrate has a far lesser impact than the mass function on the form of the temperature distribution, but we note that our alternate birthrates tend to favor slightly smaller values of $\alpha$ than the constant birthrate. Our code for simulating these distributions is publicly available. As another use case for this code, we present findings on the width and location of the subdwarf temperature gap by simulating distributions of very old (8-10 Gyr) brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Neutral Hydrogen in the Heliosphere: New Horizons Observations in the Context of Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar neutral (ISN) hydrogen is the most abundant species in the outer heliosheath and the very local interstellar medium (VLISM). Charge exchange collisions in the outer heliosheath result in filtration, reducing the ISN hydrogen density inside the heliosphere. Additionally, these atoms are intensively ionized close to the Sun, resulting in a substantial reduction of their density within a few au from the Sun. The products of this ionization - pickup ions (PUIs) - are detected by charged particle detectors. The Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on New Horizons provides, for the first time, PUI observations from the distant heliosphere. We analyze the observations collected between 22 and 52 au from the Sun to find the ISN hydrogen density profile and compare the results with predictions from global heliosphere models. We conclude that the density profile derived from the observations is inconsistent with steady-state model predictions. This discrepancy is not explained by time variations close to the Sun and thus may be related to the temporal evolution of the outer boundaries or VLISM conditions. Furthermore, we show that the cold and hot models of ISN hydrogen distribution are not a good approximation closer to the termination shock. Therefore, we recommend a new fiduciary point based on the available New Horizons observations at 40 au from the Sun, at ecliptic direction (285.62{\deg}, 1.94{\deg}), where the ISN hydrogen density is 0.11 cm$^{-3}$. The continued operation of New Horizons should give better insight into the source of the discussed discrepancy.</description>

      <title>The ups and downs of inferred cosmological lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I summarize the stellar side of the cosmological lithium problem(s). Evidence from independent studies is accumulating and indicates that stars may very well be fully responsible for lowering their surface lithium from the predicted primordial value to observed levels through internal element-transport mechanisms collectively referred to as atomic diffusion. While atomic diffusion can be modelled from first principles, stellar evolution uses a parametrized representation of convection making it impossible to predict convective-boundary mixing as a vital stellar process moderating atomic diffusion. More work is clearly needed here for a fully quantitative picture of lithium (and metallicity) evolution as stars age. Lastly, note that inferred stellar lithium-6 abundances have all but disappeared.</description>

      <title>Carbon Monoxide Cooling in Radiative Transfer Modeling of Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) emission has been observed in a number of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and is known to be an important coolant at late times. We have implemented a chemical reaction network in the radiative-transfer code CMFGEN to investigate the formation of CO and its impact on SN ejecta. We calculate two 1D SN models with and without CO: a BSG explosion model at one nebular epoch and a full time sequence (50 to 300 days) for a RSG explosion. In both models, CO forms at nebular times in the dense, inner regions at velocities $&lt;2000 \mathrm{km/s}$ where line emission from CO can dominate the cooling and reduce the local temperature by as much as a factor of two, weakening emission lines and causing the optical light curve to fade faster. That energy is instead emitted in CO bands, primarily the fundamental band at $\sim 4.5\mathrm{\mu m}$, which accounts for up to 20% of the total luminosity at late times. However, the non-monotonic nature of the CO cooling function can cause numerical difficulties and introduce multiple temperature solutions. This issue is compounded by the sensitivity of the CO abundance to a few reaction rates, many of which have large uncertainties or disparate values across literature sources. Our results also suggest that, in many SNe, CO level populations are far from their LTE values. Unfortunately, accurate collisional data, necessary to compute NLTE populations, are limited to a few transitions.</description>

      <title>A SART-Based Iterative Inversion Methodology to Infer the Solar Rotation Rate from Global Helioseismic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new iterative rotation inversion technique based on the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique developed for image reconstruction. We describe in detail our algorithmic implementation and compare it to the classical inversion techniques like the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and the Optimally Localized Averages (OLA) methods. In our implementation, we are able to estimate the formal uncertainty on the inferred solution using standard error propagation, and derive the averaging kernels without recourse to any Monte-Carlo simulation. We present the potential of this new technique using simulated rotational frequency splittings. We use noiseless sets that cover the range of observed modes and associate to these artificial splittings observational uncertainties. We also add random noise to present the noise magnification immunity of the method. Since the technique is iterative we also show its potential when using an apriori solution. With the right regularization this new method can outperform our RLS implementation in precision, scope and resolution. Since it results in very different averaging kernels where the solution is poorly constrained, this technique infers different values. Adding such a technique to our compendium of inversion methods will allow us to improve the robustness of our inferences when inverting real observations and better understand where they might be biased and/or unreliable, as we push our techniques to maximize the diagnostic potential of our observations.</description>

      <title>Observational characteristics of circum-planetary-mass-object disks in the era of James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have confirmed circumplanetary disks (CPDs) embedded in parental protoplanetary disks (PPDs). On the other hand, planetary-mass companions (PMCs) and planetary-mass objects (PMOs) are likely to harbor their own accretion disks. Unlike PPDs, CPDs and other disks around planet analogues are generally too compact to be spatially resolved by current instrumentation. In this study, we generate over 4,000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of circum-PMO-disks (CPMODs) with various host temperature and disk properties, which can be categorized into four prototypes, i.e., full, pre-transitional, transitional and evolved CPMODs. We propose a classification scheme based on their near-to-mid-infrared colors. Using those CPMOD models, we synthesize JWST (NIRCam and MIRI) photometry for F444W, F1000W and F2550W wide filters. We show F444W - F1000W and F444 - F2550W colors can be applied to distinguish different types of CPMODs, especially for those around hot hosts. Our results indicate that the ongoing and future JWST observations are promising to unveil structures and properties of CPMODs.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam 4-5 $\mu$m Imaging of the Giant Planet AF Lep b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a dynamical mass of $3 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$, the recently discovered giant planet AF Lep b is the lowest-mass imaged planet with a direct mass measurement. Its youth and spectral type near the L/T transition make it a promising target to study the impact of clouds and atmospheric chemistry at low surface gravities. In this work, we present JWST/NIRCam imaging of AF Lep b. Across two epochs, we detect AF Lep b in F444W ($4.4 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$) with S/N ratios of 9.6 and 8.7, respectively. At the planet's separation of $320 \, \mathrm{mas}$ during the observations, the coronagraphic throughput is ${\approx}7\%$, demonstrating that NIRCam's excellent sensitivity persists down to small separations. The F444W photometry of AF Lep b affirms the presence of disequilibrium carbon chemistry and enhanced atmospheric metallicity. These observations also place deep limits on wider-separation planets in the system, ruling out $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$ planets beyond $15.6 \, \mathrm{au}$ (0.58 arcsec), $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Sat}$ planets beyond $27 \, \mathrm{au}$ (1 arcsec), and $2.8 \, M_\mathrm{Nep}$ planets beyond $67 \, \mathrm{au}$ (2.5 arcsec). We also present new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ imaging of AF Lep b; combining this with the two epochs of F444W photometry and previous Keck $L'$ photometry provides limits on the long-term 3-$5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ variability of AF Lep b on months-to-years timescales. AF Lep b is the closest-separation planet imaged with JWST to date, demonstrating that planets can be recovered well inside the nominal (50% throughput) NIRCam coronagraph inner working angle.</description>

      <title>Dust-Evacuated Zones Near Massive Stars: Consequences of Dust Dynamics on Star-forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars form within dense cores composed of both gas and dust within molecular clouds. However, despite the crucial role that dust plays in the star formation process, its dynamics is frequently overlooked, with the common assumption being a constant, spatially uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size spectrum. In this study, we introduce a set of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star forming molecular clouds from the {\small STARFORGE} project. These simulations expand upon the earlier radiation MHD models, which included cooling, individual star formation, and feedback. Notably, they explicitly address the dynamics of dust grains, considering radiation, drag, and Lorentz forces acting on a diverse size spectrum of live dust grains. We find that interactions between radiation and dust significantly influence the properties of gas surrounding and accreting onto massive stars. Specifically, we find that once stars exceed a certain mass threshold ($\sim 2 M_{\odot}$), their emitted radiation can evacuate dust grains from their vicinity, giving rise to a dust-suppressed zone of size $\sim 100$ AU. Commencing during the early accretion stages and preceding the Main-sequence phase, this process results in a mass-dependent depletion in the accreted dust-to-gas (ADG) mass ratio within both the circumstellar disc and the star. We predict massive stars ($\gtrsim 10 M_{\odot}$) would exhibit ADG ratios that are approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of their parent clouds. Consequently, stars, their discs, and circumstellar environments would display notable deviations in the abundances of elements commonly associated with dust grains, such as carbon and oxygen.</description>

      <title>The nucleosynthetic fingerprint of the outermost protoplanetary disk and early Solar System dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge of the nucleosynthetic isotope composition of the outermost protoplanetary disk is critical to understand the formation and early dynamical evolution of the Solar System. We report the discovery of outer disk material preserved in a pristine meteorite based on its chemical composition, organic-rich petrology, and 15N-rich, deuterium-rich, and 16O-poor isotope signatures. We infer that this outer disk material originated in the comet-forming region. The nucleosynthetic Fe, Mg, Si and Cr compositions of this material reveal that, contrary to current belief, the isotope signature of the comet-forming region is ubiquitous amongst outer Solar System bodies, possibly reflecting an important planetary building block in the outer Solar System. This nucleosynthetic component represents fresh material added to the outer disk by late accretion streamers connected to the ambient molecular cloud. Our results show that most Solar System carbonaceous asteroids accreted material from the comet-forming region, a signature lacking in the terrestrial planet region.</description>

      <title>Metallicity relations in LMC and SMC from the slope of Red Giant Branch stars in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red giants are an excellent tool for probing the history of star formation and subsequent metallicity evolution in the galaxies. The well-defined red giant branch (RGB) stars of the globular clusters can be used to determine their slopes and to calibrate the RGB slope parameters, age, and metallicity relations. We obtained deep near-IR $JHK$ stellar photometry of 23 LMC/SMC globular clusters. The cluster sample covers a wide range in metallicities $(-1.76&lt;{\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;-0.32)$ and ages $(0.6\,{\rm Gyr}&lt;t&lt;14\,{\rm Gyr})$. The slope of the RGBs of each cluster was calculated and used to derive the relations between slope-age-metallicity. We have found that the RGB slope do not shows any statistically significant age dependence. The young and old clusters are found to be distributed differently in RGB slope-metallicity space, and the younger populations show a slightly less steep RGB slope dependence than the whole cluster sample. The population of the younger clusters shows a negative slope, whereas the older clusters show a positive slope.</description>

      <title>Candidate Young Stellar Objects in the S-cluster: The Kinematic Analysis of a Sub-population of the Low-mass G-objects close to Sgr A*</title>

Abstract: The observation of several L-band emission sources in the S cluster has led to a rich discussion of their nature. However, a definitive answer to the classification of the dusty objects requires an explanation for the detection of compact Doppler-shifted Br$\gamma$ emission. The ionized hydrogen in combination with the observation of mid-infrared $L$-band continuum emission suggests that most of these sources are embedded in a dusty envelope. These embedded sources are part of the S-cluster, and their relationship to the S-stars is still under debate. Until now, the question of the origin of these two populations is vague, although all explanations favor migration processes for the individual cluster members.
  This work revisits the S-cluster and its dusty members orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr~A* on bound Keplerian orbits from a kinematic perspective. The aim is to explore the Keplerian parameters for patterns that might imply a non-random distribution of the sample. Additionally, various analytical aspects are considered to address the nature of the dusty sources. Based on the photometric analysis, we estimated the individual $H-K$ and $K-L$ colors for the source sample and compared the results to known cluster members. The classification revealed a noticeable contrast between the S-stars and the dusty sources. To fit the flux-density distribution, we utilized the radiative transfer code HYPERION and implemented a Young Stellar Object Class I model. We obtained the position angle from the Keplerian fit results, and additionally, we analyzed the distribution of the inclinations and the longitudes of the ascending node. The colors of the dusty sources suggest a stellar nature consistent with the spectral energy distribution in the near and mid-infrared domains.</description>

      <title>On the Interacting/Active Lifetime of Supernova Fallback Disk around Isolated Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fallback disk model is widely accepted to explain long-period neutron stars (NSs) which can't be simulated by magnetic dipole radiation. However, no confirmed detection of disk was found from the newly discovered long period pulsars GLEAM-X 162759.5-523504.3, GPM J1839-10 and the known slowest isolated NSs 1E 161348-5055. This might be that the disks have either been in noninteracting/inactive state where its emission is too weak to be detected or have been disrupted. In this work, we conduct simulations to examine the lifetime of supernova fallback disks around isolated neutron stars. We assume that the disk's mass varies in a self-similar way and its interaction with the NS occurs only in interacting/active state. Our results reveal that nearly all the interacting lifetimes for the disk are shorter than 0.1 Myr while the existence lifetimes are considerably longer.</description>

      <title>MINDS. A multi-instrument investigation into the molecule-rich JWST-MIRI spectrum of the DF Tau binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars form in multiple systems whose properties can significantly impact circumstellar disk evolution. We investigate the physical and chemical properties of the equal-mass, small separation (~66 mas, ~9 au) DF Tau binary system. Previous observations indicated that only DF Tau A has a circumstellar disk. We present JWST-MIRI MRS observations of DF Tau. The MIRI spectrum shows a forest of H2O lines and emission from CO, C2H2, HCN, CO2, and OH. LTE slab models are used to determine the properties of the gas, and we analyze high angular spatial and spectral resolution data from ALMA, VLTI-GRAVITY, and IRTF-iSHELL to aid in the interpretation of the JWST data. The 1.3 mm ALMA continuum data show two equal-brightness sources of compact (R&lt;3 au) emission, with separations and movement consistent with astrometry from VLTI-GRAVITY and the known orbit. This is interpreted as a robust detection of a disk around DF Tau B, which we suggest may host a small (~1 au) cavity to reconcile all observations. The disk around DF Tau A is expected to be a full disk, and spatially and spectrally resolved dust and gas emission points to hot, close-in (&lt;0.2 au) material. Hot (~500-1000 K) H2O, HCN, and C2H2 emission in the MIRI data likely originate in the DF Tau A disk, while a cold (&lt;200 K) H2O component with an extended emitting area is consistent with an origin from both disks. Despite the very compact outer disks, the inner disk composition and conditions are similar to isolated systems, suggesting that the close binary nature is not a driving factor in setting the inner disk chemistry. However, constraining the geometry of the disks, for instance, via higher resolution ALMA observations, would provide additional insight into the mid-infrared gas emission. JWST observations of spatially resolved binaries will be important for understanding the impact of binarity on inner disk chemistry more generally.</description>

      <title>A JWST/MIRI and NIRCam Analysis of the Young Stellar Object Population in the Spitzer I region of NGC 6822</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an imaging survey of the Spitzer I star-forming region in NGC 6822 conducted with the NIRCam and MIRI instruments onboard JWST. Located at a distance of 490 kpc, NGC 6822 is the nearest non-interacting low-metallicity ($\sim$0.2 $Z_{\odot}$) dwarf galaxy. It hosts some of the brightest known HII regions in the local universe, including recently discovered sites of highly-embedded active star formation. Of these, Spitzer I is the youngest and most active, and houses 90 color-selected candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) identified from Spitzer Space Telescope observations. We revisit the YSO population of Spitzer I with these new JWST observations. By analyzing color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) constructed with NIRCam and MIRI data, we establish color selection criteria and construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to identify candidate YSOs and characterize the full population of young stars, from the most embedded phase to the more evolved stages. In this way, we have identified 140 YSOs in Spitzer I. Comparing to previous Spitzer studies of the NGC 6822 YSO population, we find that the YSOs we identify are fainter and less massive, indicating that the improved resolution of JWST allows us to resolve previously blended sources into multiple objects.</description>

      <title>The relative prevalence of wave-packets and coherent structures in the inertial and kinetic ranges of turbulence as seen by Solar Orbiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Solar Orbiter (SO) mission provides the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind turbulence. We use SO observations of nine extended intervals of homogeneous turbulence to determine when turbulent magnetic field fluctuations may be characterized as: (i) wave-packets and (ii) coherent structures (CS). We perform the first systematic scale-by-scale decomposition of the magnetic field using two wavelets known to resolve wave-packets and discontinuities, the Daubechies 10 (Db10) and Haar respectively. The probability distributions (pdfs) of turbulent fluctuations on small scales exhibit stretched tails, becoming Gaussian at the outer scale of the cascade. Using quantile-quantile plots, we directly compare the wavelet fluctuations pdfs, revealing three distinct regimes of behaviour. Deep within the inertial range (IR) both decompositions give essentially the same fluctuation pdfs. Deep within the kinetic range (KR) the pdfs are distinct as the Haar wavelet fluctuations have larger variance and more extended tails. On intermediate scales, spanning the IR-KR break, the pdf is composed of two populations: a core of common functional form containing $\sim97\%$ of fluctuations, and tails which are more extended for Haar fluctuations than Db10 fluctuations. This establishes a crossover between wave-packet (core) and CS (tail) phenomenology in the IR and KR respectively. The range of scales where the pdfs are $2$-component is narrow at $0.9$ au ($4-16$ s) and broader ($0.5-8$ s) at $0.4$ au. As CS and wave-wave interactions are both candidates to mediate the turbulent cascade, these results offer new insights into the distinct physics of the IR and KR.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in Multiphase Turbulence: Impacts on Dynamics and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both multiphase gas and magnetic fields are ubiquitous in astrophysics. However, the influence of magnetic fields on mixing of the different phases is still largely unexplored. In this study, we use both turbulent radiative mixing layer (TRML) and turbulent box simulations to examine the effects of magnetic fields on cold gas growth rates, survival, and the morphology of the multiphase gas. Our findings indicate that, in general, magnetic fields suppress mixing in TRMLs while turbulent box simulations show comparatively marginal differences in growth rates and survival of the cold gas. We reconcile these two seemingly contrasting results by demonstrating that similar turbulent properties result in comparable mixing -- regardless of the presence or absence of magnetic fields. We, furthermore, find the cold gas clump size distribution to be independent of the magnetic fields but the clumps are more filamentary in the MHD case. Synthetic MgII absorption lines support this picture being marginally different with and without magnetic fields; both cases aligning well with observations. We also examine the magnetic field strength and structure in turbulent boxes. We generally observe a higher mean magnetic field in the cold gas phase due to flux freezing and reveal fractal-like magnetic field lines in a turbulent environment.</description>

      <title>Phase-space entropy cascade and irreversibility of stochastic heating in nearly collisionless plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a nearly collisionless plasma consisting of a species of `test particles' in 1D-1V, stirred by an externally imposed stochastic electric field. The mean effect on the particle distribution function is stochastic heating. Accompanying this heating is the generation of fine-scale structure in the distribution function, which we characterize with the collisionless (Casimir) invariant $C_2 \propto \iint dx dv \, \langle f^2 \rangle$. We find that $C_2$ is transferred from large scales to small scales in both position and velocity space via a phase-space cascade enabled by both particle streaming and nonlinear interactions between particles and the stochastic electric field. We compute the steady-state fluxes and spectrum of $C_2$ in Fourier space, with $k$ and $s$ denoting spatial and velocity wavenumbers, respectively. Whereas even the linear phase mixing alone would lead to a constant flux of $C_2$ to high $s$ (towards the collisional dissipation range) at every $k$, the nonlinearity accelerates this cascade by intertwining velocity and position space so that the flux of $C_2$ is to both high $k$ and high $s$ simultaneously. Integrating over velocity (spatial) wavenumbers, the $k$-space ($s$-space) flux of $C_2$ is constant down to a dissipation length (velocity) scale that tends to zero as the collision frequency does, even though the rate of collisional dissipation remains finite. The resulting spectrum in the inertial range is a self-similar function in the $(k,s)$ plane, with power-law asymptotics at large $k$ and $s$. We argue that stochastic heating is made irreversible by this entropy cascade and that, while collisional dissipation accessed via phase mixing occurs only at small spatial scales rather than at every scale as it would in a linear system, the cascade makes phase mixing even more effective overall in the nonlinear regime than in the linear one.</description>
