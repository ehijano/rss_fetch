      <title>A necessary condition for non-monotonic dose response, with an application to a kinetic proofreading model -- Extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady state non-monotonic ("biphasic") dose responses are often observed in experimental biology, which raises the control-theoretic question of identifying which possible mechanisms might underlie such behaviors. It is well known that the presence of an incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL) in a network may give rise to a non-monotonic response. It has been conjectured that this condition is also necessary, i.e. that a non-monotonic response implies the existence of an IFFL. In this paper, we show that this conjecture is false, and in the process prove a weaker version: that either an IFFL must exist or both a positive loop and a negative feedback loop must exist. Towards this aim, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for when minors of a symbolic matrix have mixed signs. Finally, we study in full generality when a model of immune T-cell activation could exhibit a steady state non-monotonic dose response.</description>

      <title>Exact analytic expressions for discrete first-passage time probability distributions in Markov networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-passage time (FPT) is the time it takes a system variable to cross a given boundary for the first time. In the context of Markov networks, the FPT is the time a random walker takes to reach a particular node (target) by hopping from one node to another. If the walker pauses at each node for a period of time drawn from a continuous distribution, the FPT will be a continuous variable; if the pauses last exactly one unit of time, the FPT will be discrete and equal to the number of hops. We derive an exact analytical expression for the discrete first-passage time (DFPT) in Markov networks. Our approach is as follows: first, we divide each edge (connection between two nodes) of the network into $h$ unidirectional edges connecting a cascade of $h$ fictitious nodes and compute the continuous FPT (CFPT). Second, we set the transition rates along the edges to $h$, and show that as $h\to\infty$, the distribution of travel times between any two nodes of the original network approaches a delta function centered at 1, which is equivalent to pauses lasting 1 unit of time. Using this approach, we also compute the joint-probability distributions for the DFPT, the target node, and the node from which the target node was reached. A comparison with simulation confirms the validity of our approach.</description>
