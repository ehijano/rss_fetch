      <title>Flexible 3D Cage-based Deformation via Green Coordinates on B\'{e}zier Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cage-based deformation is a fundamental problem in geometry processing, where a cage, a user-specified boundary of a region, is used to deform the ambient space of a given mesh. Traditional 3D cages are typically composed of triangles and quads. While quads can represent non-planar regions when their four corners are not coplanar, they form ruled surfaces with isoparametric curves being line segments, which limits their ability to handle curved and high-curvature deformations. In this work, we extend the cage for curved boundaries using B\'{e}zier patches, enabling flexible and high-curvature deformations with only a few control points. The higher-order structure of the B\'{e}zier patch also allows for the creation of a more compact and precise curved cage for the input model. Based on Green's third identity, we derive the Green coordinates for the B\'{e}zier cage, achieving shape preserving deformation with smooth surface boundaries. These coordinates are defined based on the vertex positions and normals of the B\'{e}zier control net. Given that the coordinates are approximately calculated through Riemann summation, we propose a global projection technique to ensure that the coordinates accurately conform to the linear reproduction property. Experimental results show that our method achieves high performs in handling curved and high-curvature deformations.</description>

      <title>InsTex: Indoor Scenes Stylized Texture Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-quality textures for 3D scenes is crucial for applications in interior design, gaming, and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). Although recent advancements in 3D generative models have enhanced content creation, significant challenges remain in achieving broad generalization and maintaining style consistency across multiple viewpoints. Current methods, such as 2D diffusion models adapted for 3D texturing, suffer from lengthy processing times and visual artifacts, while approaches driven by 3D data often fail to generalize effectively. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InsTex, a two-stage architecture designed to generate high-quality, style-consistent textures for 3D indoor scenes. InsTex utilizes depth-to-image diffusion priors in a coarse-to-fine pipeline, first generating multi-view images with a pre-trained 2D diffusion model and subsequently refining the textures for consistency. Our method supports both textual and visual prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results in visual quality and quantitative metrics, and demonstrates its effectiveness across various 3D texturing applications.</description>

      <title>GS-LiDAR: Generating Realistic LiDAR Point Clouds with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR novel view synthesis (NVS) has emerged as a novel task within LiDAR simulation, offering valuable simulated point cloud data from novel viewpoints to aid in autonomous driving systems. However, existing LiDAR NVS methods typically rely on neural radiance fields (NeRF) as their 3D representation, which incurs significant computational costs in both training and rendering. Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and nuScenes demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, as well as training and rendering efficiency.</description>

      <title>3DGS$^2$: Near Second-order Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream solution for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a collection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with superior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt with the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at most linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes, even with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order convergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our approach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a Gaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which endorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by splitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes, analytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group, and efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like convergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second, kernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This property allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate overshoot during stochastic training. Our method converges an order faster than standard GPU-based 3DGS training, requiring over $10\times$ fewer iterations while maintaining or surpassing the quality of the compared with the SGD-based 3DGS reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Relightable Full-Body Gaussian Codec Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Relightable Full-Body Gaussian Codec Avatars, a new approach for modeling relightable full-body avatars with fine-grained details including face and hands. The unique challenge for relighting full-body avatars lies in the large deformations caused by body articulation and the resulting impact on appearance caused by light transport. Changes in body pose can dramatically change the orientation of body surfaces with respect to lights, resulting in both local appearance changes due to changes in local light transport functions, as well as non-local changes due to occlusion between body parts. To address this, we decompose the light transport into local and non-local effects. Local appearance changes are modeled using learnable zonal harmonics for diffuse radiance transfer. Unlike spherical harmonics, zonal harmonics are highly efficient to rotate under articulation. This allows us to learn diffuse radiance transfer in a local coordinate frame, which disentangles the local radiance transfer from the articulation of the body. To account for non-local appearance changes, we introduce a shadow network that predicts shadows given precomputed incoming irradiance on a base mesh. This facilitates the learning of non-local shadowing between the body parts. Finally, we use a deferred shading approach to model specular radiance transfer and better capture reflections and highlights such as eye glints. We demonstrate that our approach successfully models both the local and non-local light transport required for relightable full-body avatars, with a superior generalization ability under novel illumination conditions and unseen poses.</description>

      <title>Guiding-Based Importance Sampling for Walk on Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Walk on stars (WoSt) has shown its power in being applied to Monte Carlo methods for solving partial differential equations, but the sampling techniques in WoSt are not satisfactory, leading to high variance. We propose a guiding-based importance sampling method to reduce the variance of WoSt. Drawing inspiration from path guiding in rendering, we approximate the directional distribution of the recursive term of WoSt using online-learned parametric mixture distributions, decoded by a lightweight neural field. This adaptive approach enables importance sampling the recursive term, which lacks shape information before computation. We introduce a reflection technique to represent guiding distributions at Neumann boundaries and incorporate multiple importance sampling with learnable selection probabilities to further reduce variance. We also present a practical GPU implementation of our method. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces variance compared to the original WoSt, given the same time or the same sample budget. Code and data will be released.</description>

      <title>PhyDeformer: High-Quality Non-Rigid Garment Registration with Physics-Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PhyDeformer, a new deformation method for high-quality garment mesh registration. It operates in two phases: In the first phase, a garment grading is performed to achieve a coarse 3D alignment between the mesh template and the target mesh, accounting for proportional scaling and fit (e.g. length, size). Then, the graded mesh is refined to align with the fine-grained details of the 3D target through an optimization coupled with the Jacobian-based deformation framework. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on synthetic and real garments highlight the effectiveness of our method.</description>
