      <title>On the effectiveness of odor-baited traps on mosquito-borne infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The host's odor serves as a critical biological tracking signal in the host-seeking process of mosquitoes, and its heterogeneity significantly influences the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. In this study, we propose a mosquito-borne disease model incorporating odor-baited traps to examine the impact of odor on disease transmission. Following recent experimental evidence, we also assume that infected humans are more attractive than susceptible or recovered ones.
  The value of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, depends on the attractiveness of traps, adjusted relative to infected individuals; the dependence on the relative attractiveness of susceptibles is non-monotone, suggesting that there exists an optimal mosquito preference that maximizes disease transmission. When $R_0&gt;1$, there exists an endemic equilibrium which, under certain conditions, is proved to be globally stable. An endemic equilibrium may also exist when $R_0 &lt; 1$, due to a backward bifurcation occurring when infected humans incur significant mortality. The phenomenon of backward bifurcation is reduced when odor-baited traps are more abundant.
  Analytical results and simulations show that deploying traps and enhancing their lethality for mosquitoes can help reduce disease prevalence and the risk of an outbreak. However, the attenuation of odor in highly attractive traps may lead to a rebound in the epidemic, especially when the traps gradually lose their attractiveness compared to susceptible hosts.</description>

      <title>Population genetics in complex ecological communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecological interactions can dramatically alter evolutionary outcomes in complex communities. Yet, the classic theoretical results of population genetics (e.g., Kimura's fixation formula) largely ignore ecological effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by using dynamical mean-field theory to integrate ecology into classical population genetics models. We show that ecological interactions between parents and mutants result in frequency-dependent selection and can be characterized by a single emergent parameter that measures the strength of ecological feedbacks. We derive an explicit analytic expression for the fixation probability that generalizes Kimura's famous result and analyze it in various ecological and evolutionary limits. We find that ecological interactions suppress fixation probabilities for moderately beneficial mutants when compared to Kimura's predictions, with the strength of suppression increasing with larger effective population sizes, greater selective differences between parent and mutant, and for ecosystems with a large number of "open niches" (i.e., ecosystems well below the packing bound). Frequency-dependent selection also gives rise to prolonged parent-mutant coexistence in complex communities, a phenomenon absent in classical population genetics. Our study establishes a framework for integrating ecological interactions into population genetics models and helps illuminate how ecology can affect evolutionary outcomes.</description>

      <title>The role of viral dynamics and infectivity in models of oncolytic virotherapy for tumours with different motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of ad-hoc engineered viruses in the fight against tumours is one of the greatest ideas in cancer therapeutics within the last three decades. Together with other strategies such as immunotherapies, nanoparticles and adjunct therapies, the use of viral vectors in clinical trials and in the clinics has been and is still widely studied and pursued. The ability of those vectors to infiltrate and infect tumours represents one of the key attributes that regulates the success of such a strategy. Although some remarkable successes have been obtained, it is still not entirely clear how to achieve reliable protocols that can be routinely employed with confidence on a significant range of tumours. In this work, we thus concentrate on the study of different mathematical descriptions of virotherapy with the aim of better understanding the role of viral infectivity and viral dynamics in positive therapeutic outcomes. In particular, we compare probabilistic, individual approaches with continuous, spatially inhomogeneous models and investigate the importance of different tumour motility and different mathematical representations of viral infectivity. These formulations also allow us to arrive at better analytical characterisation of how waves of viral infections arise and propagate in tumours, providing interesting insights into therapy dynamics. Similarly to previous studies, oscillatory behaviours, stochasticity and cancers' diffusivities are all central to the eradication or the escape of tumours under virotherapy. Here, though, our results also show that the ability of viruses to infect tumours seems, in certain cases, more important to a final positive outcome than tumours' motility or even reproducibility. This could hopefully represent a first step into better insights into viral dynamics that may help clinicians to achieve consistently better outcomes.</description>

      <title>Modeling the control of West Nile virus using mosquito reduction methods, vaccination of equids, and human behavioral adaptation to the usage of personal protective equipment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the genus Flaviviridae circulating between mosquitoes and birds, while humans, equids, and other mammals are dead-end hosts. Several preventive measures are recommended to reduce the WNV burden among different hosts. In this work, we develop a mathematical framework for evaluating the theoretical effectiveness of various WNV control methods in Germany. We consider mosquito reduction methods such as the physical removal and destruction of potential mosquito breeding sites, the use of larvicides, and the use of adulticides. We also evaluate the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) that aims to reduce human-mosquito contact. Adopting PPEs may not happen instantly due to different perceptions, social influence, and the perceived inconvenience and/or frustration that come with using PPEs. Thus, we model a dynamic adoption of PPEs by considering the perceived risk of infection, perceived inconvenience of using PPEs, and the imitation dynamics due to social influence. Furthermore, the model captures vaccination of equids. We formulate and study an optimal control problem, where mosquito controls are temperature-dependent and the decision to start or stop applying the control methods is influenced by the changes in temperature. The optimal control model supports the development and seasonal timing of cost-effective mosquito control methods. For example, results from the optimal control study show that mosquito control efforts in Germany should be initiated during early spring and stopped at the end of June or early July, during the first year of control, to avoid overuse and unnecessary costs. Finally, we developed a Shiny app that allows users to test how different combinations of interventions could reduce WNV cases.</description>

      <title>Fire severity and recovery across Europe: insights from forest diversity and landscape metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, European forests have faced an increased incidence of fire disturbances. This phenomenon is likely to persist, given the rising frequency of extreme events expected in the future. Estimating canopy recovery time after disturbance serves as a critical assessment for understanding forest resilience, which can ultimately help determine the ability of forests to regain their capacity to provide essential ecosystem services. This study estimated fire severity and post-disturbance recovery in European forests using a remote sensing--based time series approach. MODIS Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series data were used to track the evolution of vegetation cover over burned areas from 2001 to 2024. Fire severity was defined relative to pre-disturbance conditions by comparing vegetation status before and after fire events. Recovery intervals were determined from temporal evolution of vegetation greening as the duration required to reach the pre-disturbance LAI baseline. Furthermore, this study analyzed the severity and recovery indicators in relation to forest species diversity and landscape heterogeneity metrics across Europe, offering valuable insights into the spatial variability of forest response dynamics across diverse forest ecosystems across Europe. Results revealed a consistent pattern across vegetation cover types: higher forest species diversity and greater landscape shape complexity were associated with lower fire severity and, notably, shorter recovery times following fire disturbance.</description>

      <title>A consistent SIR model on time scales with exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new dynamic SIR model that, in contrast with the available model on time scales, is biological relevant. For the new SIR model we obtain an explicit solution, we prove the asymptotic stability of the extinction and disease-free equilibria, and deduce some necessary conditions for the monotonic behavior of the infected population. The new results are illustrated with several examples in the discrete, continuous, and quantum settings.</description>

      <title>Controlling sternness in judging a good person who helps the bad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on indirect reciprocity with private assessment on complete graphs suggest the possibility that one can continuously modulate the degree of segregation by controlling how to judge a good person helping a bad one. A well-known social norm called L6 judges it as bad, which eventually segregates the society into two antagonistic clusters, but if it is judged as good, the system reaches paradise where everyone likes each other. In this work, we numerically study this transition between segregation and paradise in two different settings. Firstly, in a uniform population of size $N$ where everyone regards such a donor as good with probability $p$ and bad with $1-p$, we observe paradise when $Np$ is sufficiently greater than $O(1)$. In contrast, in a heterogeneous setting where only $k$ individuals judge such a donor as good, the size difference of the clusters increases almost linearly as $k$ increases, so paradise can only be reached as $k \to N$ in a large population. Therefore, when an urgent change is needed to overcome the segregation due to L6, a small change in each and every individual's behavior is more efficient than a radical change in a fraction of the population.</description>

      <title>Griffiths phase emerging from strong mutualistic disorder in high-dimensional interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of analysis of interacting systems is done for weak and well-balanced interactions, when in fact topology and rare event factors often result in strong and sign-biased interactions when considering real systems. We analyse the impact of strong mutualistic interactions in a uniformly weighted Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi network under generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamics. In difference to the typical case we show the interaction topology and system dynamics combine to produce power law abundance distributions in a critical region of the phase diagram, identifiable as a Griffiths phase. We find asymptotic expressions for the fixed point solution in this region, and establish the boundary of this region as when topology alone determines the abundance distribution. We show that the Griffiths phase persists for strong mutualistic interactions more generally, and survives when combined with weak all-to-all competition.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of self-organized clusters with phase transitions in ecological communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex ecological communities, species may self-organize into clusters or clumps where highly similar species can coexist. The emergence of such species clusters can be captured by the interplay between neutral and niche theories. Based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model of competition, we propose a minimal model for ecological communities in which the steady states contain self-organized clusters. In this model, species compete only with their neighbors in niche space through a common interaction strength. Unlike many previous theories, this model does not rely on random heterogeneity in interactions. By varying only the interaction strength, we find an exponentially large set of cluster patterns with different sizes and combinations. There are sharp phase transitions into the formation of clusters. There are also multiple phase transitions between different sets of possible cluster patterns, many of which accumulate near a small number of critical points. We analyze such a phase structure using both numerical and analytical methods. In addition, the special case with only nearest neighbor interactions is exactly solvable using the method of transfer matrices from statistical mechanics. We analyze the critical behavior of these systems and make comparisons with existing lattice models.</description>

      <title>Evolution of mutating pathogens in networked populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epidemic spreading over populations networks has been an important subject of research for several decades, and especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Most epidemic outbreaks are likely to create multiple mutations during their spreading over the population. In this paper, we study the evolution of a pathogen which can mutate continuously during the epidemic spreading. We consider pathogens whose mutating parameter is the mortality mean-time, and study the evolution of this parameter over the spreading process. We use analytical methods to compute the dynamic equation of the epidemic and the conditions for it to spread. We also use numerical simulations to study the pathogen flow in this case, and to understand the mutation phenomena. We show that the natural selection leads to less violent pathogens becoming predominant in the population. We discuss a wide range of network structures and show how different effects are manifested in each case. We also applied our theory in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, using relevant epidemiological data collected for this outbreak. We provided explanations for the variants spreading processes observed throughout this pandemic.</description>

      <title>A mean-field theory for heterogeneous random growth with redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between random multiplicative growth and redistribution/migration in the mean-field limit, when the number of sites is very large but finite. We find that for static random growth rates, migration should be strong enough to prevent localisation, i.e. extreme concentration on the fastest growing site. In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</description>
