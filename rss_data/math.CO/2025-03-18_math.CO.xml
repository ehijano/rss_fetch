      <title>Vanishing coefficient results in four families of infinite q-products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent past, the work in the area of vanishing coefficients of infinite $q$-products has been taken to the forefront. Weaving the same thread as Ramanujan, Richmond, Szekeres, Andrews, Alladi, Gordon, Mc Laughlin, Baruah, Kaur, Tang, we further prove vanishing coefficients in arithmetic progressions moduli 5, 7, 11, 13, 19, 21, 23 and 29 of the following four families of infinite products, where $\{X_{a,b,sm,km,u,v}(n)\}_{n\geq n_0}$, $\{Y_{a,b,sm,km,u,v}(n)\}_{n\geq n_0}$, $\{Z_{a,b,sm,km,u,v}(n)\}_{n\geq n_0}$ and $\{W_{a,b,sm,km,u,v}(n) \}_{n\geq n_0}$ are defined by \begin{align*} \sum_{n\geq n_0}^{\infty}X_{a,b,sm,km,u,v}(n)q^n:=&amp;(q^{a},q^{sm-a};q^{sm})_{infty}^u(q^{b},q^{km-b};q^{km})_{infty}^v, \\ \sum_{n\geq n_0}^{\infty}Y_{a,b,sm,km,u,v}(n)q^n:=&amp;(q^{a},q^{sm-a};q^{sm})_{infty}^u(-q^{b},-q^{km-b};q^{km})_{infty}^v, \\ \sum_{n\geq n_0}^{\infty}Z_{a,b,sm,km,u,v}(n)q^n:=&amp;(-q^{a},-q^{sm-a};q^{sm})_{infty}^u(q^{b},q^{km-b};q^{km})_{infty}^v,\\ \sum_{n\geq n_0}^{\infty}W_{a,b,sm,km,u,v}(n)q^n:=&amp;(-q^{a},-q^{sm-a};q^{sm})_{infty}^u(-q^{b},-q^{km-b};q^{km})_{infty}^v, \end{align*} here $a, b, s, k, u$ and $v$ are chosen in such a way that the infinite products in the right-hand side of the above are convergent and $n_0$ is an integer (possibly negative or zero) depending on $a, b, s, k, u$ and $v$. The proof uses the Jacobi triple product identity and the properties of Ramanujan general theta function.</description>

      <title>Elusive properties of countably infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph property is elusive (or evasive) if any algorithm testing it by asking questions of the form ''Is there an edge between vertices x and y?'' must, in the worst case, examine all pairs of vertices. Elusiveness for infinite vertex sets has been first studied by Csern\'ak and Soukup, who proved that the long-standing Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg Conjecture -- which states that every nontrivial monotone graph property is elusive -- fails for infinite vertex sets. We extend their work by giving a closer look to the case when the vertex set is countably infinite and the ''algorithm'' terminates after infinitely many steps. Among others, we prove that connectedness is elusive, which strengthens a result of Csern\'ak and Soukup. We give counterexamples to the infinite version of the Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg Conjecture even if the ''algorithm'' is required to terminate after infinitely many steps, which strengthens results of Csern\'ak and Soukup.</description>

      <title>Local algorithms for coplactic switching and evacuation of Young tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tableau switching is a well studied bijection on pairs of skew Young tableaux which swaps their relative positions. This is achieved by successively sliding the entries of the inner tableaux through the outer one via jeu de taquin (JDT) slides. Tableau coswitching is a similar but coplactic operation, meaning it commutes with any sequence of JDT slides. Coswitching is defined by first performing JDT rectification on the union of the tableaux, switching the resulting pair, then unrectifying the union. This definition requires us to perform large scale modifications to the skew shapes during the rectification and unrectification steps, which is both computationally taxing and obscures the effect of coswitching on the pair of skew tableaux. In previous work, Gillespie and Levinson define an algorithm which computes coswitching as a sequence of local moves, which do not alter the skew shapes of the tableaux, when one of the tableaux is a single box.
  In this paper, we extend the results of Gillespie and Levinson (and Gillespie, Levinson, and Purbhoo for type B) to the case the two skew tableaux are of arbitrary size. We also describe multiple bijections on tableaux, each descending to the evacuation shuffling (esh) operation on pairs of dual equivalence classes. We show how special cases of our local algorithm compute the Sch\"utzenberger involution on skew tableaux, as well as the wall-crossing and monodromy of certain covering spaces of the moduli space $\overline{M}_{0, r}(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Thresholds for the biased Maker-Breaker domination games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $(a,b)$-biased Maker-Breaker domination game, two players alternately select unplayed vertices in a graph $G$ such that Dominator selects $a$ and Staller selects $b$ vertices per move. Dominator wins if the vertices he selected during the game form a dominating set of $G$, while Staller wins if she can prevent Dominator from achieving this goal. Given a positive integer $b$, Dominator's threshold, $\textrm{a}_b$, is the minimum $a$ such that Dominator wins the $(a,b)$-biased game on $G$ when he starts the game. Similarly, $\textrm{a}'_b$ denotes the minimum $a$ such that Dominator wins when Staller starts the $(a,b)$-biased game. Staller's thresholds, $\textrm{b}_a$ and $\textrm{b}'_a$, are defined analogously. It is proved that Staller wins the $(k-1,k)$-biased games in a graph $G$ if its order is sufficiently large with respect to a function of $k$ and the maximum degree of $G$. Along the way, the $\ell$-local domination number of a graph is introduced. This new parameter is proved to bound Dominator's thresholds $\textrm{a}_\ell$ and $\textrm{a}_\ell'$ from above. As a consequence, $\textrm{a}_1'(G)\le 2$ holds for every claw-free graph $G$. More specific results are obtained for thresholds in line graphs and Cartesian grids. Based on the concept of $[1,k]$-factor of a graph $G$, we introduce the star partition width $\sigma(G)$ of $G$, and prove that $\textrm{a}_1'(G)\le \sigma(G)$ holds for any nontrivial graph $G$, while $\textrm{a}_1'(G)=\sigma(G)$ if $G$ is a tree.</description>

      <title>Criticality for Maker-Breaker domination games with predomination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A predominated graph is a pair $(G,D)$, where $G$ is a graph and the vertices in $D\subseteq V(G)$ are considered already dominated. Maker-Breaker domination game critical (MBD critical) predominated graphs are introduced as the predominated graphs $(G,D)$ on which Staller wins the game, but Dominator wins on $(G, D \cup \{v\})$ for every vertex $v \in V(G) \setminus D$.
  Tools are developed for handling the Maker-Breaker domination game on trees which lead to a characterization of Staller-win predominated trees. MBD critical predominated trees are characterized and an algorithm is designed which verifies in linear time whether a given predominated tree is MBD critical. A large class of MBD critical predominated cacti is presented and Maker-Breaker critical hypergraphs constructed.</description>

      <title>Bikernels by monochromatic paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of bikernel by monochromatic paths of a bicolored digraph. This concept is strongly motivated by the existing notions of kernels, kernels by monochromatic paths, and double stable augmented categories. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions for several families of bicolored digraphs to have a bikernel by monochromatic paths. Also, we characterize bicolored digraphs without monochromatic cycles that possess a bikernel by monochromatic paths. Similarly, we characterize bicolored digraphs with monochromatic cycles that also have a bikernel by monochromatic paths. Furthermore, we prove sufficient and necessary conditions for some families of digraphs to be $BK$-colorable. This means that a bicoloration of the digraph exists where the resulting bicolored digraph has a bikernel.</description>

      <title>Steiner Quadruple Systems with Minimum Colorable Derived Designs: Constructions and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-block-coloring, simply $r$-coloring, of a Steiner triple system $\mathrm{STS}(v)$ is a partition of the block set into $r$ color classes, each color class being a partial parallel class. The chromatic index of $\mathrm{STS}(v)$, denoted by $\chi^{\prime}(v)$, is the smallest $r$ for which an $r$-coloring of an $\mathrm{STS}(v)$ exists. A minimum colorable Steiner triple system $\mathrm{mcSTS}(v)$ is an $\mathrm{STS}(v)$ admitting a $\chi^{\prime} (v)$-coloring. We generalize the notion of an $\mathrm{RDSQS}$ (a Steiner quadruple system $\mathrm{SQS}$ with resolvable derived designs) to $\mathrm{mcDSQS}$, representing an $\mathrm{SQS}$ whose derived design at every point is minimum colorable. This is motivated from an application in non-binary diameter perfect codes. The purpose of this paper is to display a few recursive constructions to produce $\mathrm{mcDSQS}$s via Steiner systems $\mathrm{S}(3,K,v)$ with certain properties. Among others, a construction for $\mathrm{mcDSQS}$s is developed, which is also new even for $\mathrm{RDSQS}$s; special constructions concentrating only on $\mathrm{mcDSQS}(6n+2)$s are demonstrated as well. As the main results, both a new infinite family of $\mathrm{RDSQS}(6n+4)$s and the first infinite family of $\mathrm{mcDSQS}(6n+2)$s are constructed. To be specific, an $\mathrm{RDSQS}(2^{2m+1}+2)$ and an $\mathrm{mcDSQS}(2\cdot 9^{m}+2)$ are proved to exist, in which the former class gives rise to a new infinite family of large sets of Kirkman triple systems. As applications, the smallest $q$ is determined such that a diameter perfect constant-weight $(n,\frac{1}{4}\tbinom{n}{3},6;4)_{q}$ code exists where $n \in\{ 2\cdot 9^{m}+2:m\geq 1\}\bigcup\{ 2^{2m+1}+2:m\geq 0\}$.</description>

      <title>Mixed Dimer Models for Euler and Catalan Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of mixed dimer covers on skew Young diagrams of ribbon shape (also called border strips or snake graphs). For the two extreme cases of straight and zigzag shapes, we show that the number of mixed dimer covers are given by the Euler and Catalan numbers. We also give q-analogs by showing that the rank generating functions of the partial orders on mixed dimer covers agree with certain q-Euler and q-Catalan numbers. These q-analogs are a consequence of an isomorphism between the partial order on mixed dimer covers and the so-called middle order on certain classes of permutations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a point set $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, a family of sets is $S$-intersecting if its members have a point in common in $S$. Recently, Edwards and Sober\'{o}n proved a fractional version of Halman's theorem for axis-parallel boxes, showing that every finite family $F$ of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with positive density of $S$-intersecting $(d+1)$-tuples contains an $S$-intersecting subfamily of size linear in $|F|$. We prove that qualitatively the same conclusion can be achieved if the density of $S$-intersecting pairs is sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tan et al. conjectured that connected co-edge-regular graphs with four distinct eigenvalues and fixed smallest eigenvalue, when having sufficiently large valency, belong to two different families of graphs. In this paper we construct two new infinite families of connected co-edge-regular graphs with four distinct eigenvalues and fixed smallest eigenvalue, thereby disproving their conjecture. Moreover, one of these constructions demonstrates that clique-extensions of Latin Square graphs are not determined by their spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of $t$-hooks of doubled distinct partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Griffin, Ono, and Tsai examined the distribution of the number of $t$-hooks in partitions of $n$, which was later followed by the work of Craig, Ono, and Singh on the distribution of the number of $t$-hooks in self-conjugate partitions of $n$. Motivated by these studies, in this paper, we further investigate the number of $t$-hooks in some subsets of partitions. More specifically, we obtain the generating functions for the number of $t$-hooks in doubled distinct partitions and the number of $t$-shifted hooks in strict partitions. Based on these generating functions, we prove that the number of $t$-hooks in doubled distinct partitions and the number of $t$-shifted hooks in strict partitions are both asymptotically normally distributed.</description>

      <title>On the determinant of the walk matrix of the rooted product with a path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $n$-vertex graph $G$, the walk matrix of $G$, denoted by $W(G)$, is the matrix $[e,A(G)e,\ldots,(A(G))^{n-1}e]$, where $A(G)$ is the adjacency matrix of $G$ and $e$ is the all-ones vector. For two integers $m$ and $\ell$ with $1\le \ell\le (m+1)/2$, let $G\circ P_m^{(\ell)}$ be the rooted product of $G$ and the path $P_m$ taking the $\ell$-th vertex of $P_m$ as the root, i.e., $G\circ P_m^{(\ell)}$ is a graph obtained from $G$ and $n$ copies of the path $P_m$ by identifying the $i$-th vertex of $G$ with the $\ell$-th vertex (the root vertex) of the $i$-th copy of $P_m$ for each $i$. We prove that, $\det W(G\circ P_m^{(\ell)})$ equals $\pm (\det A(G))^{\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor}(\det W(G))^m$ if $\gcd(\ell,m+1)=1$, and equals 0 otherwise. This extends a recent result established in [Wang et al. Linear Multilinear Algebra 72 (2024): 828--840] which corresponds to the special case $\ell=1$. As a direct application, we prove that if $G$ satisfies $\det A(G)=\pm 1$ and $\det W(G)=\pm 2^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}$, then for any sequence of integer pairs $(m_i,\ell_i)$ with $\gcd(\ell_i,m_i+1)=1$ for each $i$, all the graphs in the family \begin{equation*}
  G\circ P_{m_1}^{(\ell_1)}, (G\circ P_{m_1}^{(\ell_1)})\circ P_{m_2}^{(\ell_2)}, ((G\circ P_{m_1}^{(\ell_1)})\circ P_{m_2}^{(\ell_2)})\circ P_{m_3}^{(\ell_3)},\ldots \end{equation*} are determined by their generalized spectrum.</description>

Abstract: The cyclic subgroup graph ${\Gamma(G)}$ of a group $G$ is the simple undirected graph with cyclic subgroups as a vertex set and two distinct vertices $H_1$ and $H_2$ are adjacent if and only if $H_1 \leq H_2$ and there does not exist any cyclic subgroup $K$ such that $H_1 &lt; K &lt; H_2$. In this paper, we classify all the finite groups $G$ such that $\Gamma(G)$ is the line graph of some graph.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an indexed family ${\cal A} = (A_1, A_2, \dotsc, A_n)$ of subsets of some given set $S$, a \emph{transversal} is a set of distinct elements $x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n$ with each $x_i \in A_i$. Transversals have been studied since 1935 and have many attractive properties, with a deep connection to matroids. A $q$-analog is formed by replacing the notion of a set by the notion of a vector space, with a corresponding replacement of other concepts. In this paper we define a $q$-analog of the theory of transversals, and show that many of the main properties of ordinary transversals are shared by this analog.</description>

      <title>Gluing Posets and the Dichotomy of Poset Saturation Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $\mathcal P$, we say that a family $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $[n]$ is $\mathcal P$-saturated if $\mathcal F$ does not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$, but adding any other set to $\mathcal F$ creates an induced copy of $\mathcal P$. The induced saturation number of $\mathcal P$, denoted by $\text{sat}^*(n,\mathcal P)$, is the size of the smallest $\mathcal P$-saturated family with ground set $[n]$. The saturation number for posets is known to exhibit a dichotomy: it is either bounded or it has at least $\sqrt n$ rate of growth. Whether or not a poset has bounded or unbounded saturation number is not a monotone property, in the sense that if a poset is present as an induced copy in another poset, their saturation numbers are generally unrelated. Moreover, so far there is no characterization for posets that have unbounded saturation number.
  Let $\mathcal P_1$ and $\mathcal P_2$ be two finite posets. We denote by $\mathcal P_2*\mathcal P_1$ the poset obtained by making all elements of $\mathcal P_1$ strictly less than all elements of $\mathcal P_2$. In this paper we show that this `gluing' operation preserves (under some assumptions) both the bounded and the unbounded saturation number. More precisely, we show that, under minor assumptions, if one of the posets has unbounded saturation number, so does $\mathcal P_2*\mathcal P_1$, but if they both have bounded saturation number, then so does $\mathcal P_2*\mathcal P_1$. We also give linear upper bounds for all complete multipartite posets (which do not have two trivial consecutive layers). We also consider poset percolating families, the poset equivalent of weak saturation for graphs. We determine the exact value for the size of a minimal percolating family, for all posets.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees in directed square cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify weakly connected spanning closed (WCSC) subgraphs of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$, the square of a directed $n$-vertex cycle. Then we show that every spanning tree of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$ is contained in a unique nontrivial WCSC subgraph of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$. As a result, we obtain a purely combinatorial derivation of the formula for the number of directed spanning trees of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$. Moreover, we obtain the formula for the number of directed spanning trees of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$, which is a Jacobsthal number.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation on a generalized Hamming cube \MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the critical probability $p_c(Q_n,r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r$ on the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $V(Q_n)=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1$. More precisely, by utilizing the techniques developed by Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009), we determine the first-order term of $p_c(Q_n,n^a)$ where $\frac{2}{3}&lt;a&lt; 1$. Additionally, we obtain the critical probability $p_c(Q_{k,n},r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r=\frac{N}{2}$ on the generalized $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_{k,n}$ with vertex set $V(Q_{k,n})=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1,2,\dots,k$, where $k\ge 2$ and $N=\sum_{i=1}^k\binom{n}{i}$. More precisely, we obtain the first-order term of $p_c(Q_{k,n},\frac{N}{2})$ and some bounds on the second-order term by extending the main theorem from Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009).</description>

      <title>Every $2k$-connected $(P_2\cup kP_1)$-free graph with toughness greater than one is hamiltonian-connected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, a graph $G$ is $H$-free if $G$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. Shi and Shan conjectured that every $1$-tough $2k$-connected $(P_2 \cup kP_1)$-free graph is hamiltonian for $k \geq 4$. This conjecture has been independently confirmed by Xu, Li, and Zhou, as well as by Ota and Sanka. Inspired by this, we prove that every $2k$-connected $(P_2\cup kP_1)$-free graph with toughness greater than one is hamiltonian-connected.</description>

      <title>Topological Indices With Degree Sequence $\mathscr{D}$ of Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we refer to a asymptotic degree sequence as $\mathscr{D}=(d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n)$. The examination of topological indices on trees gives us a general overview through bounds to find the maximum and minimum bounds which reflect the maximum and minimum number of edges incident to every vertex in the graph, Albertson index known as $\sum_{uv\in E(G)}\lvert d_u(G)-d_v(G) \rvert$, Sigma index $\sigma(G)$ among $\mathscr{D}$ of tree $T$ when $d_n\geqslant \dots \geqslant d_1$. According to the first zegrb we show for a degree sequence of order $n=4$, $\operatorname{irr}(T)=M_1(T)^2-2\sqrt{M_1(T)}+\sum_{i=1}^4\left|x_i-x_{i+1}\right|-(b+c)-1$.</description>

      <title>Connected Partitions via Connected Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical theorem due to Gy\H{o}ri and Lov\'{a}sz states that any $k$-connected graph $G$ admits a partition into $k$ connected subgraphs, where each subgraph has a prescribed size and contains a prescribed vertex, as soon as the total size of target subgraphs is equal to the size of $G$. However, this result is notoriously evasive in terms of efficient constructions, and it is still unknown whether such a partition can be computed in polynomial time, even for $k = 5$.
  We make progress towards an efficient constructive version of the Gy\H{o}ri--Lov\'{a}sz theorem by considering a natural weakening of the $k$-connectivity requirement. Specifically, we show that the desired connected partition can be found in polynomial time, if $G$ contains $k$ disjoint connected dominating sets. As a consequence of this result, we give several efficient approximate and exact constructive versions of the original Gy\H{o}ri--Lov\'{a}sz theorem:
  1. On general graphs, a Gy\H{o}ri--Lov\'{a}sz partition with $k$ parts can be computed in polynomial time when the input graph has connectivity $\Omega(k \cdot \log^2 n)$;
  2. On convex bipartite graphs, connectivity of $4k$ is sufficient;
  3. On biconvex graphs and interval graphs, connectivity of $k$ is sufficient, meaning that our algorithm gives a ``true'' constructive version of the theorem on these graph classes.</description>

      <title>An infinite family of simple graphs underlying chiral, orientable reflexible and non-orientable rotary maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first known infinite family of simple graphs, each of which is the skeleton of a chiral map, a skeleton of a reflexible map on an orientable surfaces, as well as a skeleton of a reflexible map on a non-orientable surface. This family consists of all lexicographic product $C_n[mK_1]$, where $m\ge 3$, $n = sm$, with $s$ an integer not divisible by $4$. This answers a question posed in [S.\ Wilson, Families of regular graphs in regular maps, {\em Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B} 85 (2002), 269--289].</description>

Abstract: Kemeny's constant quantifies the expected time for a random walk to reach a randomly chosen vertex, providing insight into the global behavior of a Markov chain. We present a novel eigenvector-based formula for computing Kemeny's constant. Moreover, we analyze the impact of network structure on Kemeny's constant. In particular, we use various spectral techniques, such as spectral sparsification of graphs and eigenvalue interlacing, and show that they are particularly useful in this context for deriving approximations and sharp bounds for Kemeny's constant</description>

      <title>Good Triangulations of Cosmological Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological polytopes of graphs are a geometric tool in physics to study wavefunctions for cosmological models whose Feynman diagram is given by the graph. After their recent introduction by Arkani-Hamed, Benincasa and Postnikov the focus of interest shifted towards their mathematical properties, e.g., their face structure and triangulations. Juhnke, Solus and Venturello used toric geometry to show that these polytopes have a so-called good triangulation that is unimodular. Based on these results Bruckamp et al. studied the Ehrhart theory of those polytopes and in particular the h*-polynomials of cosmological polytopes of multitrees and multicycles. In this article we complete this part of the story. We enumerate all maximal simplices in good triangulations of any cosmological polytope. Furthermore, we provide a method to turn such a triangulation into a half-open decomposition from which we deduce that the h*-polynomial of a cosmological polytope is a specialization of the Tutte polynomial of the defining graph. This settles several open questions and conjectures of Juhnke, Solus and Venturello as well as Bruckamp et al.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph and $I_3(G)$ be its $3$-path ideal in the corresponding polynomial ring $R$. In this article, we prove that for an arbitrary graph $G$, $reg(R/I_3(G))$ is bounded below by $2\nu_3(G)$, where $\nu_3(G)$ denotes the $3$-path induced matching number of $G$. We give a class of graphs, namely, trees for which the lower bound is attained. Also, for a unicyclic graph $G$, we show that $reg(R/I_3(G))\leq 2\nu_3(G)+2$ and provide an example that shows that the given upper bound is sharp.</description>

      <title>On binomial edge ideals of corona of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $J_G$ denote the corresponding binomial edge ideal. This article considers the binomial edge ideal of the corona product of two connected graphs $G$ and $H$. The corona product of $G$ and $H$, denoted by $G\circ H$, is a construction where each vertex of $G$ is connected (via the coning-off) to an entire copy of $H$. This is a direct generalization of a cone construction. Previous studies have shown that for $J_{G \circ H}$ to be Cohen-Macaulay, both $G$ and $H$ must be complete graphs. However, there are no general formulae for the dimension, depth, or Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $J_{G\circ H}$ for all graphs $G$ and $H$. In this article, we provide a general formula for the dimension, depth and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the binomial edge ideals of certain corona and corona-type (somewhat a generalization of corona) products of special interests. Additionally, we study the Cohen-Macaulayness, unmixedness and related properties of binomial edge ideals corresponding to above class of graphs. We have also added a short note on the reduction of the Bolognini-Macchia-Strazzanti Conjecture to all graphs with a diameter of $3$.</description>

      <title>Dual Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Hecke algebras in Type $A$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\chi^{\lambda}_{\mu}$ be the value of the irreducible character $\chi^{\lambda}$ of the Hecke algebra of the symmetric group on the conjugacy class of type $\mu$. The usual Murnaghan-Nakayama rule provides an iterative algorithm based on reduction of the lower partition $\mu$. In this paper, we establish a dual Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Hecke algebras of type $A$ using vertex operators by applying reduction to the upper partition $\lambda$. We formulate an explicit recursion of the dual Murnaghan-Nakayama rule by employing the combinatorial model of ``brick tabloids", which refines a previous result by two of us (J. Algebra 598 (2022), 24--47).</description>

Abstract: We characterize the cusp classes and their widths for the congruence subgroups $\Gamma(N), \Gamma_1(N)$ and $\Gamma_0(N)$. We relate the cusp classes of $\Gamma_0(N)$ with those produced by the connected fundamental domain in the previous work of Nie and Parent. By further studying the interesting functions $M$ and $W$ on ${\mathbb Z}/N$, we establish an identity relating the widths.</description>

      <title>The topology of simple games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of simple games from the point of view of combinatorial topology. The starting premise is that the losing coalitions of a simple game can be identified with a simplicial complex. Various topological constructions and results from the theory of simplicial complexes then carry over to the setting of simple games. Examples are cone, join, and the Alexander dual, each of which have interpretations as familiar game-theoretic objects. We also provide some new topological results about simple games, most notably in applications of homology of simplicial complexes to weighted simple games. The exposition is introductory and largely self-contained, intended to inspire further work and point to what appears to be a wealth of potentially fruitful directions of investigation bridging game theory and topology.</description>

In a recent work, Nath, Saikia, and Sarma derived several families of congruences for $T_{\ell,k}(n)$, with particular emphasis on the cases $T_{2,3}(n)$ and $T_{4,3}(n)$. In the concluding remarks of their paper, they conjectured that $T_{2,3}(n)$ satisfies an infinite set of congruences modulo 6. In this paper, we confirm their conjecture by proving a much more general result using elementary $q$-series techniques. We also present new families of congruences satisfied by $T_{\ell,k}(n)$.</description>

      <title>Schur Rank, Compatibility Degree, and the Canonical Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12700v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of denominator vectors can be extended to all generic basis elements of upper cluster algebras in a natural way. Under a weakened version of generic pairing assumption, we provide a representation-theoretic interpretation for this extended notion. We derive several consequences in this generality. We present a counterexample to the conjecture that distinct cluster monomials have distinct denominator vectors. Utilizing a new rank function called the Schur rank, we extend the notion of compatibility degree. As an application, we find a tropical method to compute the multiplicity of a real component in the canonical decomposition of $\delta$-vectors.</description>

      <title>Sharp character bounds and cutoff profiles for symmetric groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a flexible technique to estimate the characters of symmetric groups, via the Murnaghan--Nakayama rule, the Larsen--Shalev character bounds, the Naruse hook length formula, and appropriate diagram slicings. This allows us to prove sharp character bounds as well as asymptotic equivalents for characters of low-level representations. We also prove an optimal uniform character bound. As a result, we prove under a mild condition on the support size that random walks on symmetric groups generated by a conjugacy class exhibit a total variation and $L^2$ cutoff and find their cutoff profiles.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic properties of generalized Delannoy polynomials and Schr\"oder polynomials</title>

Abstract: Let $n$ be any nonnegative integer and \[ D_n^{(h)}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n+k}{2k}^{h}\binom{2k}{k}^{h}{x}^{k} \text{ and } S_{n}^{(h)}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n+k}{2k}^{h}C_{k}^{h}{x}^{k} \] be the generalized Delannoy polynomials and Schr\"oder polynomials respectively. Here $C_k$ is the Catalan number and $h$ is a positive integer. In this paper, we prove that $$\begin{align*} &amp; \frac{(2,n)}{n(n+1)(n+2)} \sum_{k=1}^{n}k^a(k+1)^a(2k+1)D_{k}^{(h)}(x)^{m}\in\mathbb{Z}[x],\\ &amp;\frac{(2,hm-1,n)}{n(n+1)(n+2)} \sum_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^{k}k^a(k+1)^a(2k+1)D_{k}^{(h)}(x)^{m}\in\mathbb{Z}[x],\\ &amp;\frac{(2,n)}{n(n+1)(n+2)} \sum_{k=1}^{n}k^a(k+1)^a(2k+1)S_{k}^{(h)}(x)^{m}\in\mathbb{Z}[x],\\ &amp;\frac{(2,m-1,n)}{n(n+1)(n+2)} \sum_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^{k}k^a(k+1)^a(2k+1)S_{k}^{(h)}(x)^{m}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]. \end{align*}$$ Taking $a=1$ will confirm some of Z.-W. Sun's conjectures.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this note is to rectify a typographical error in the statements of Theorems 5.5 and 5.6 of Sharma, Chauhan and Singh[3] and further analyze and discuss the significance of the results derived in Takieldin and Sol\'e [4]. In our opinion, several claims made by the authors in [4] are either factually incorrect or lack adequate substantiation, which may confuse the readers about the contributions of [1,3]. Our remarks on the work [4] intend to provide the clarity and inform about the true contributions and findings of our research.</description>

Abstract: We construct a tropical analogue of the Poincar\'e bundle and prove a (cohomological) Fourier-Mukai transform for real tori with integral structures. We then prove a tropical analogue of Beauville's generalized Poincar\'e formula for polarized abelian varieties. Some consequences include a geometric Riemann-Roch theorem for tropical abelian varieties, as well as a tropical Poincar\'e-Prym formula which was recently conjectured by R\"ohrle and Zakharov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of links we call torus necklaces for which the link groups are precisely the braid groups of generalised $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, this correspondence exhibits the meridians of the aforementioned link groups as braid reflections. In particular, this construction generalises to all irreducible rank two complex reflection groups a well-known correspondence between some rank two complex braid groups and some torus knot groups. In addition, as abstract groups, we show that the family of link groups associated to Seifert links coincides with the family of circular groups. This shows that every time a link group has a non-trivial center, it is a Garside group.</description>

Abstract: Every monomial ideal $I$ has a Scarf complex, which is a subcomplex of its minimal free resolution. We say that $I$ is Scarf if its Scarf complex is also its minimal free resolution. In this paper, we fully characterize all pairs $(G,n)$ of a graph $G$ and an integer $n$ such that the squarefree power $I(G)^{[n]}$ or the symbolic power $I(G)^{(n)}$ of the edge ideal $I(G)$ is Scarf. We also determine all graphs $G$ such that its cover ideal $J(G)$ is Scarf, with an explicit description when $G$ is either chordal or bipartite.</description>

      <title>Deciding if a DAG is Interesting is Hard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{interestingness score} of a directed path $\Pi = e_1, e_2, e_3, \dots, e_\ell$ in an edge-weighted directed graph $G$ is defined as $\texttt{score}(\Pi) := \sum_{i=1}^\ell w(e_i) \cdot \log{(i+1)}$, where $w(e_i)$ is the weight of the edge $e_i$. We consider two optimization problems that arise in the analysis of Mapper graphs, which is a powerful tool in topological data analysis. In the IP problem, the objective is to find a collection $\mathcal{P}$ of edge-disjoint paths in $G$ with the maximum total interestingness score. %; that is, two raised to the power of the sum of the weights of the paths in $\mathcal{P}$. For $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the $k$-IP problem is a variant of the IP problem with the extra constraint that each path in $\mathcal{P}$ must have exactly $k$ edges. Kalyanaraman, Kamruzzaman, and Krishnamoorthy (Journal of Computational Geometry, 2019) claim that both IP and $k$-IP (for $k \geq 3$) are NP-complete. We point out some inaccuracies in their proofs. Furthermore, we show that both problems are NP-hard in directed acyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>Irregular triads in 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01737v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past several years, numerous authors have explored model theoretically motivated combinatorial conditions that ensure that a graph has an efficient regular decomposition in the sense of Szemer\'edi. In this paper we set out a research program that explores a corresponding set of questions for 3-uniform hypergraphs, a setting in which useful notions of regularity are significantly more intricate.
  The main results in this paper concern certain combinatorial properties which arose as natural higher-order generalizations of the order property in parallel work of the authors in the arithmetic setting. Interpreted in the context of 3-uniform hypergraphs, these are tightly connected to the nature of irregular triads. Specifically, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform hypergraphs admits regular decompositions with so-called "linear error" if and only if it does not have the functional order property.
  Along the way, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform hypergraphs is homogeneous (i.e. all regular triads have density near $0$ or near $1$) if and only it has bounded $\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension. This provides a quantitative version of a recent result of Chernikov and Towsner.
  We also address several questions arising from prior work on tame regularity in hypergraphs. In particular, we characterize the hereditary properties of $3$-uniform hypergraphs admitting the type of regular partitions appearing in work of Fox et al. as those that have bounded slicewise $\textrm{VC}$-dimension. This is again analogous to a recent non-quantitative result of Chernikov and Towsner.</description>

Abstract: We present problems and results that combine graph-minors and coarse geometry. For example, we ask whether every geodesic metric space (or graph) without a fat $H$ minor is quasi-isometric to a graph with no $H$ minor, for an arbitrary finite graph $H$. We answer this affirmatively for a few small $H$. We also present a metric analogue of Menger's theorem and Konig's ray theorem. We conjecture metric analogues of the Erdos--Posa Theorem and Halin's grid theorem.</description>

Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple connected graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$. The third atom-bond connectivity index, $ABC_3$ index, of $G$ is defined as $ABC_3(G)=\sum\limits_{uv\in E(G)}\sqrt{\frac{e(u)+e(v)-2}{e(u)e(v)}}$, where eccentricity $e(u)$ is the largest distance between $u$ and any other vertex of $G$, namely $e(u)=\max\{d(u,v)|v\in V(G)\}$. This work determines the maximal $ABC_3$ index of unicyclic graphs with any given girth and trees with any given diameter, and characterizes the corresponding graphs.</description>

      <title>Induced saturation for complete bipartite posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $s,t\in\mathbb{N}$, a complete bipartite poset $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$ is a poset whose Hasse diagram consists of $s$ pairwise incomparable vertices in the upper layer and $t$ pairwise incomparable vertices in the lower layer, such that every vertex in the upper layer is larger than all vertices in the lower layer. A family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^{[n]}$ is called induced $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$-saturated if $(\mathcal{F},\subseteq)$ contains no induced copy of $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$, whereas adding any set from $2^{[n]}\backslash\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{F}$ creates an induced $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$. Let $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{K}_{s,t})$ denote the smallest size of an induced $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$-saturated family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^{[n]}$. It was conjectured that $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{K}_{s,t})$ is superlinear in $n$ for certain values of $s$ and $t$. In this paper, we show that $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{K}_{s,t})=O(n)$ for all fixed $s,t\in\mathbb{N}$. Moreover, we prove a linear lower bound on $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{P})$ for a large class of posets $\mathcal{P}$, particularly for $\mathcal{K}_{s,2}$ with $s\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Chordal Circular-arc Graphs: I. Split Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most elusive problem around the class of circular-arc graphs is identifying all minimal graphs that are not in this class. The main obstacle is the lack of a systematic way of enumerating these minimal graphs. McConnell [FOCS 2001] presented a transformation from circular-arc graphs to interval graphs with certain patterns of representations. We fully characterize these interval patterns for circular-arc graphs that are split graphs, thereby building a connection between minimal split graphs that are not circular-arc graphs and minimal non-interval graphs. This connection enables us to identify all minimal split graphs that are not circular-arc graphs. As a byproduct, we develop a linear-time certifying recognition algorithm for circular-arc graphs when the input is a split graph.</description>

      <title>On the $\Delta$-edge stability number of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Delta$-edge stability number ${\rm es}_{\Delta}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of edges of $G$ whose removal results in a subgraph $H$ with $\Delta(H) = \Delta(G)-1$. Sets whose removal results in a subgraph with smaller maximum degree are called mitigating sets. It is proved that there always exists a mitigating set which induces a disjoint union of paths of order $2$ or $3$. Minimum mitigating sets which induce matchings are characterized. It is proved that to obtain an upper bound of the form ${\rm es}_{\Delta}(G) \leq c |V(G)|$ for an arbitrary graph $G$ of given maximum degree $\Delta$, where $c$ is a given constant, it suffices to prove the bound for $\Delta$-regular graphs. Sharp upper bounds of this form are derived for regular graphs. It is proved that if $\Delta(G) \geq\frac{|V(G)|-2}{3}$ or the induced subgraph on maximum degree vertices has a $\Delta(G)$-edge coloring, then ${\rm es}_{\Delta}(G) \le \lceil |V(G)|/2\rceil$.</description>

Abstract: Generalizing both Dirac's condition and Ore's condition for Hamilton cycles, Chvatal in 1972 established a degree sequence condition for the existence of a Hamilton cycle in a graph. Hoang in 1995 generalized Chvatal's degree sequence condition for 1-tough graphs and conjectured a t-tough analogue for any positive integer t at least 1.

      <description>arXiv:2409.08446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that $k$ is a function of $n$ and $n\to\infty$. We show that with probability $1-O(1/n)$, a uniformly random $k\times n$ Latin rectangle contains no proper Latin subsquare of order $4$ or more, proving a conjecture of Divoux, Kelly, Kennedy and Sidhu. We also show that the expected number of subsquares of order 3 is bounded and find that the expected number of subsquares of order 2 is $\binom{k}{2}(1/2+o(1))$ for all $k\le n$.</description>

      <title>Largest component in Boolean sublattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a subfamily ${F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ of the Boolean lattice, consider the graph $G_{F}$ on ${F}$ based on the pairwise inclusion relations among its members. Given a positive integer $t$, how large can ${F}$ be before $G_{F}$ must contain some component of order greater than $t$? For $t=1$, this question was answered exactly almost a century ago by Sperner: the size of a middle layer of the Boolean lattice. For $t=2^n$, this question is trivial. We are interested in what happens between these two extremes. For $t=2^{g}$ with $g=g(n)$ being any integer function that satisfies $g(n)=o(n/\log n)$ as $n\to\infty$, we give an asymptotically sharp answer to the above question: not much larger than the size of a middle layer. This constitutes a nontrivial generalisation of Sperner's theorem. We do so by a reduction to a Tur\'an-type problem for rainbow cycles in properly edge-coloured graphs. Among other results, we also give a sharp answer to the question, how large can ${F}$ be before $G_{F}$ must be connected?</description>

      <title>Counting of lattices containing up to four comparable reducible elements and having nullity up to three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2020 Bhavale and Waphare introduced the concept of a nullity of a poset as nullity of its cover graph. According to Bhavale and Waphare, if a dismantlable lattice of nullity k contains r reducible elements then 2 $\leq$ r $\leq$ 2k. In 2003 Pawar and Waphare counted all non-isomorphic lattices with equal number of elements and edges, which are precisely the lattices of nullity one. Recently, Bhavale and Aware counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements having nullity up to two. Bhavale and Aware also counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements, containing up to three reducible elements, having nullity k $\geq$ 2. In this paper, we count up to isomorphism the class of all lattices on n elements containing four comparable reducible elements, and having nullity three.</description>

Abstract: We investigate Mellin integrals of products of hyperplanes, raised to an individual power each. We refer to the resulting functions as combinatorial correlators. We investigate their behavior when moving the hyperplanes individually. To encode these functions as holonomic functions in the constant terms of the hyperplanes, we aim to construct a holonomic annihilating $D$-ideal purely in terms of the hyperplane arrangement.</description>

      <title>On H-Intersecting Graph Families and Counting of Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work derives an upper bound on the maximum cardinality of a family of graphs on a fixed number of vertices, in which the intersection of every two graphs in that family contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to a specified graph H. Such families are referred to as H-intersecting graph families. The bound is derived using the combinatorial version of Shearer's lemma, and it forms a nontrivial extension of the bound derived by Chung, Graham, Frankl, and Shearer (1986), where H is specialized to a triangle. The derived bound is expressed in terms of the chromatic number of H, while a relaxed version, formulated using the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function of the complement of H, offers reduced computational complexity. Additionally, a probabilistic version of Shearer's lemma, combined with properties of the Shannon entropy, are employed to establish bounds related to the enumeration of graph homomorphisms, providing further insights into the interplay between combinatorial structures and information-theoretic principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the asymptotic behavior of weighted factorization lengths on numerical semigroups. Our approach is geometric as opposed to analytic, explains the presence of Curry-Schoenberg B-splines as limiting distributions, and provides explicit error bounds (no implied constants left unspecified). Along the way, we explicitly bound the difference between the vector partition function and the number of integer points in the variable polytope for a $2 \times k$ matrix.</description>

Abstract: Let \( \mathcal{F} \) be a family of graphs. The generalized Tur\'an number \( \operatorname{ex}(n, K_r, \mathcal{F}) \) is the maximum number of $K_r$ in an \( n \)-vertex graph that does not contain any member of \( \mathcal{F} \) as a subgraph. Recently, Alon and Frankl initiated the study of Tur\'an problems with bounded matching number. In this paper, we determine the generalized Tur\'an number of \( C_{\geq k} \) with bounded matching number.</description>

      <title>Tree-like graphings, wallings, and median graphings of equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several results showing that every locally finite Borel graph whose large-scale geometry is "tree-like" induces a treeable equivalence relation. In particular, our hypotheses hold if each component of the original graph either has bounded tree-width or is quasi-isometric to a tree, answering a question of Tucker-Drob. In the latter case, we moreover show that there exists a Borel quasi-isometry to a Borel forest, under the additional assumption of (componentwise) bounded degree. We also extend these results on quasi-treeings to Borel proper metric spaces. In fact, our most general result shows treeability of countable Borel equivalence relations equipped with an abstract wallspace structure on each class obeying some local finiteness conditions, which we call a proper walling. The proof is based on the Stone duality between proper wallings and median graphs, i.e., CAT(0) cube complexes. Finally, we strengthen the conclusion of treeability in these results to hyperfiniteness in the case where the original graph has one (selected) end per component, generalizing the same result for trees due to Dougherty--Jackson--Kechris.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove limit theorems for the number of fixed points occurring in a random pattern-avoiding permutation distributed according to a one-parameter family of biased distributions. The bias parameter exponentially tilts the distribution towards favoring permutations with more or fewer fixed points than is typical under the uniform distribution. One case we study features a phase transition where the limiting distribution changes abruptly from negative binomial to Rayleigh to normal depending on the bias parameter.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem, such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We prove that all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts are undecidable, that this is not true for $G$-SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. Furthermore we prove a Rice-like result for dynamical invariants asserting that every computable real-valued invariant for $G$-SFTs that is monotone by disjoint unions and products is constant.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.</description>

      <title>New Results on Periodic Golay Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide algorithmic methods for conducting exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs. Our methods enumerate several lengths beyond the currently known state-of-the-art available searches: we conducted exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs of all lengths $v \leq 72$ using our methods, while only lengths $v \leq 34$ had previously been exhaustively enumerated. Our methods are applicable to periodic complementary sequences in general. We utilize sequence compression, a method of sequence generation derived in 2013 by Djokovi\'c and Kotsireas. We also introduce and implement a new method of "multi-level" compression, where sequences are uncompressed in several steps. This method allowed us to exhaustively search all lengths $v \leq 72$ using less than 10 CPU years. For cases of complementary sequences where uncompression is not possible, we introduce some new methods of sequence generation inspired by the isomorph-free exhaustive generation algorithm of orderly generation. Finally, we pose a conjecture regarding the structure of periodic Golay pairs and prove it holds in many lengths, including all lengths $v \lt 100$. We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms by providing the first ever examples of periodic Golay pairs of length $v = 90$. The smallest length for which the existence of periodic Golay pairs is undecided is now $106$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the central topics in extremal graph theory is the study of the function $ex(n,H)$, which represents the maximum number of edges a graph with $n$ vertices can have while avoiding a fixed graph $H$ as a subgraph. Tur{\'a}n provided a complete characterization for the case when $H$ is a complete graph on $r$ vertices. Erd{\H o}s, Stone, and Simonovits extended Tur{\'a}n's result to arbitrary graphs $H$ with $\chi(H) &gt; 2$ (chromatic number greater than 2). However, determining the asymptotics of $ex(n, H)$ for bipartite graphs $H$ remains a widely open problem. A classical example of this is Zarankiewicz's problem, which asks for the asymptotics of $ex(n, K_{t,t})$.
  In this paper, we survey Zarankiewicz's problem, with a focus on graphs that arise from geometry. Incidence geometry, in particular, can be viewed as a manifestation of Zarankiewicz's problem in geometrically defined graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $SPP(n)$ be the set $\left\{\big(|A+A|,|A A|\big) : A\subseteq {\mathbb N}, |A|=n\right\}$ of sum-product pairs, where $A+A$ is the sumset $\{a+b : a,b\in A\}$ and $A A$ is the product set $\{ab:a,b\in A\}$. We construct a dataset consisting of 1162868 sets whose sum-product pairs are at least $84\%$ of $SPP(n)$ for each $n\le 32$. Notably, we do **not** see evidence in favor of Erd\H{o}s's Sum-Product Conjecture in our dataset. For $n\le 6$, we prove the exact value of $SPP(n)$. We include a number of conjectures, open problems, and observations motivated by this dataset, a large number of color visualizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of social media, misinformation has significant negative effects on the decision-making of individuals, organizations and communities within society. Identifying and mitigating the spread of fake information is a challenging issue. We consider a generalization of the Domination problem that can be used to detect a set of individuals who, through an awareness process, can prevent the spreading of fake narratives. The considered problem, named \textsc{$(d,r)$-Domination} generalizes both distance and multiple domination. We study the parameterized complexity of the problem according to standard and structural parameters. We give fixed-parameter algorithms as well as polynomial compressions/kernelizations for some variants of the problem and parameter combinations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, with very high probability, the random graph Laplacian has simple spectrum. Our method provides a quantitatively effective estimate of the spectral gaps. Along the way, we establish results on affine no-gaps delocalization, no-structure delocalization, overcrowding and small entries of the eigenvectors for the Laplacian model. These findings are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach to Zauner's Conjecture via the Stark Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of $d^2$ complex equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$, also known as SICPOVMs, conjectured by Zauner to exist for all d. The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d &gt; 3. Specifically, we give an explicit expression for an object we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed from the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois conjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle, is more precisely a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence subgroup of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We prove our construction gives a valid SIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark conjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost and the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$ where $\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter allows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We provide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with known solutions, particularly the extensive work of Scott and Grassl, and by constructing four numerical examples of nonequivalent SICs in d=100, three of which are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given by maximal equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We give similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r) divides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions conjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If K is any real quadratic field, then either every abelian Galois extension of K, or else every abelian extension for which 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a positive density of field discriminants.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling for Mathematical Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of the LLM-driven genetic algorithm {\it funsearch}, whose aim is to generate examples of interest to mathematicians and which has already had some success in problems in extremal combinatorics. Our implementation is designed to be useful in practice for working mathematicians; it does not require expertise in machine learning or access to high-performance computing resources. Applying {\it funsearch} to a new problem involves modifying a small segment of Python code and selecting a large language model (LLM) from one of many third-party providers. We benchmarked our implementation on three different problems, obtaining metrics that may inform applications of {\it funsearch} to new problems. Our results demonstrate that {\it funsearch} successfully learns in a variety of combinatorial and number-theoretic settings, and in some contexts learns principles that generalize beyond the problem originally trained on.</description>
