      <title>Photon angular momentum near Planck scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the angular momentum structure of the gauge field in Lorentz covariant relativistic generalized uncertainty principle (RGUP) framework incorporating Planck scale minimal length effects. Using Noether's theorem for higher derivative RGUP-modified gauge field Lagrangian, we obtain the canonical and symmetric (Belinfante) energy-momentum tensors and the corresponding gauge spin and orbital angular momentum currents. We show that the canonical and Belinfante-Rosenfeld angular-momentum tensors continue to satisfy the standard conservation law in the presence of Planck-scale corrections. %These results support the stability of fundamental conservation laws under high-energy modifications. The RGUP corrections introduce higher-order contributions to the angular momentum density and momentum flow, yielding a modified Poynting vector, with the Maxwell limit recovered for vanishing RGUP parameter.</description>

      <title>High precision heavy-boson-jet substructure with energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-correlator-based jet substructure has gained significant attention in recent years. One of the notable applications has been the study of multi-scale jets, where distinct physical scales manifest as features localised in different angular regions of the correlator. In this article, we present the first high-precision study of energy correlators on the simplest multi-scale jets: heavy boson jets. In such systems, the boson mass $M$ introduces an additional scale, generating a sharp peak at angles $\sim M/p_T^{\rm jet}$. We show that this feature can be computed directly by boosting the EEC spectrum measured in $e^+e^- \rightarrow {\rm hadrons}$ at the $Z$ pole. We identify that the peak arises from boosting the well-studied Sudakov factorisation governing the back-to-back limit of the two-point correlator. As a result, the feature is controlled by Sudakov resummation, not a Breit-Wigner-like structure in the $Z$ decay, and is therefore calculable with exceptional precision. We provide predictions at N$^3$LL$'$ accuracy for both $pp$ $Z$-tagged jets and $e^+e^-$ di-$Z$ production, and compare them to Herwig and Pythia simulations, finding close agreement. We also demonstrate that the boosted-$Z$ spectrum can be constructed directly by boosting OPAL measurements at the $Z$ pole. In this light, energy-correlator jet substructure on the hadronic decays of heavy bosons at the LHC provide access to clean, lepton-collider-like measurements across a wide range of effective centre-of-mass energies set by the boson jet transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Precision Jet Substructure of Boosted Boson Decays with Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the precision study of boosted jet substructure using energy correlators, applying this framework to hadronic Higgs decays. We demonstrate that the two-body decay of the Higgs manifests as a distinct angular peak at $\theta \sim \arccos(1-2/\gamma^2)$ for Lorentz boost factor $\gamma$. We show that infrared scales, such as the dead-cone effect and confinement transition, are also resolved within the boosted distribution. Precision analytic studies of boosted jet substructure may enable precision electroweak studies and open new avenues for new physics searches.</description>

      <title>Probing Bose-enhanced Inflaton Decay with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic reheating dynamics in the presence of a transient condensate formed by bosonic decay products of the inflaton. We show that the emergence of such a condensate and the corresponding Bose enhancement can dramatically increase the efficiency of inflaton decay, giving rise to qualitatively new reheating dynamics beyond the standard perturbative picture. As a consequence, graviton production from inflaton decay processes is significantly amplified by Bose enhancement effects, leading to a stochastic gravitational-wave background with a potentially observable amplitude, even in the low-frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Catalog of electroweak scalar manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local structure of the Higgs sector around the vacuum does not uniquely determine its global properties. Most of the current experimental data provides only local information, which allows for a rich variety of global features, including several distinct topologies of the scalar manifold, and the existence of zero, one, or two fixed points of the symmetry transformations. Here, I provide, under general conditions, a complete classification of realizations of the electroweak symmetry with minimal field content -- the three would-be Goldstone bosons and the Higgs -- and outline some of their physical consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover an effective and communicative set of agents working with MadGraph. Agentic installation, learning-by-doing training, and user support provide easy access to state-of-the-art simulations and accelerate LHC research. We show in detail how MadAgents interact with inexperienced and advanced users, support a range of simulation tasks, and analyze results. In a second step, we illustrate how MadAgents automatize event generation and run an autonomous simulation campaign, starting from a pdf file of a paper.</description>

      <title>Constraining dimension-6 SMEFT with higher-order predictions for $p p \to t W$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study single-top production in association with a $W$ boson at the LHC as a probe of dimension-6 Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) at leading order, next-to-leading order, and approximate next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy in QCD. The process is sensitive to operators that modify the top-quark weak and chromomagnetic dipole interactions, and we perform three-parameter linear and quadratic SMEFT fits using doubly differential top-quark distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity for the Run II and Run III configurations at the LHC. We provide a detailed account of the uncertainties and quantify the impact of the different uncertainty components across bins and perturbative orders. We find that effective scales up to 2 TeV can be probed in nonmarginalized fits, while in marginalized fits the corresponding scales are around 0.5 and 1.5 TeV for linear and quadratic fits, respectively.</description>

      <title>Medium separation scheme effects on the magnetized and cold two-flavor superconducting quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS) on two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) dense quark matter under the influence of a constant external magnetic field. The effects of the proper treatment of the model divergences are examined through a comparison of different approaches, including the combined implementation of the Magnetic Field Independent Regularization (MFIR) and the MSS, as well as the standard use of smooth form factors. Our findings for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model emphasize the critical role of properly separating medium effects from vacuum contributions in the model. The combined MFIR-MSS scheme suppresses spurious unphysical oscillations, often misinterpreted in the literature as de Haas--van Alphen oscillations, and ensures the correct high-density behavior of the diquark condensate. Furthermore, within the MSS framework, the magnetization remains positive across the explored parameter space, in sharp contrast with the behavior obtained in the traditional approach.</description>

      <title>Nucleon axial-vector form factor and radius from radiatively-corrected antineutrino scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleon axial-vector form factor, $G_A$, is critical to determine the electroweak interactions of leptons with nucleons. Important examples of processes influenced by $G_A$ are elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering and muon capture by the proton. Sparse experimental data results in a large uncertainty on the momentum dependence of $G_A$ and has motivated the consideration of new experimental probes and first-principles lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) evaluations. The comparison of new and precise theoretical predictions for $G_A$ with future experimental data necessitates the application of radiative corrections to experimentally-observable processes. We apply these corrections in the extraction of $G_A$ and the associated axial-vector radius from the recent MINERvA antineutrino-hydrogen data, compare the effects from radiative corrections to other uncertainties in neutrino scattering experiments, and discuss the comparison of lattice QCD evaluations to experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Earth-Density Effects in LBL Experiments: A Comprehensive Review of Theory, Observations, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth matter density uncertainties play a non trivial role in three flavor neutrino oscillations in matter, particularly for the muon to electron appearance channel that underpins CP violation measurements in long baseline experiments. We demonstrate that when realistic spatial variations of the Earths density are taken into account, the oscillation probabilities acquire additional, energy dependent structures that cannot be captured by path-averaged density approximations. We show that mismodeling of the matter density profile can introduce degeneracies that obscure genuine leptonic CP violating effects, thereby degrading parameter sensitivity and biasing the inference of the CP phase. Identifying energy regions in which CP sensitivity remains robust against matter density uncertainties is therefore essential. These considerations indicate that marginalization over a single effective density parameter is insufficient for next generation precision measurements and motivate the incorporation of spatially resolved Earth density profiles in the analysis frameworks of future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurements of $H\rightarrow W^+W^-$ in the Fully Leptonic Decay Mode at the FCC-ee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expected precision on measuring the $\sigma(e^+ e^- \rightarrow ZH) \times Br(H\rightarrow W^+W^-)$ in the fully leptonic decay mode at the Future Circular Collider (FCC) is presented. We consider two FCC-ee scenarios: $\sqrt{s} =240$ GeV centre-of-mass energy with a luminosity of 10.8$\rm{~ab}^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{s} =365$ GeV centre-of-mass energy with a luminosity of 3.12$\rm{~ab}^{-1}$. Our results indicate that a relative uncertainty of 2.9\% and 6.8\% can be achieved on measurements of $\sigma(e^+ e^- \rightarrow ZH) \times Br(H\rightarrow W^+W^-)$ in the fully leptonic decay mode at $\sqrt{s} =240$ GeV and $\sqrt{s} =365$ GeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Two-Particle-Two-Hole Responses in Asymmetric Nuclei for Neutrino Scattering within the Relativistic Mean-Field Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of the nuclear dependence of two-particle-two-hole meson-exchange current contributions to inclusive lepton-nucleus scattering within the relativistic mean-field framework. We present microscopic calculations of nuclear responses for a set of 17 nuclei, ranging from helium to uranium, using a model with different Fermi momenta for protons and neutrons. We propose a novel scaling prescription based on the two-particle phase space and key nuclear parameters. The resulting description is accurate over a wide range of nuclear targets, with typical deviations below 10\%, and allows for a separate treatment of the different emission channels. In addition, a consistent benchmark against electron-scattering data is provided. The parametrization presented provides a practical framework for extending the responses to different nuclear targets in neutrino event generators.</description>

      <title>Lepton sourced baryon asymmetry in the fourth generation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe can be accommodated in the extended Standard Model with sequential fourth generation fermions (SM4). We first construct the dimension-6 effective operators of the type $-i(\Phi^\dagger\Phi)\bar F_L\Phi f_R$ induced by fourth generation quarks, which carry the $CP$ violation (CPV) source from the $4\times 4$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, $\Phi$ ($F_L$, $f_R$) being a Higgs double (left-handed fermion doublet, right-handed fermion singlet). The required inputs of the fourth generation fermion masses were derived in our previous dispersive analyses on heavy quark decays and neutral meson mixing. The similar framework allows the determination of the $4\times 4$ CKM matrix elements $V_{ib'}$, $i=u$, $c$ and $t$, such that the strength of the CPV source can be evaluated unambiguously. The dimension-6 operators associated with fourth generation leptons, as implemented into the formalism for the electroweak baryogenesis in the literature, lead to the baryon-over-entropy ratio $\eta_B\approx 10^{-10}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the tomographical structure of baryons by studying the nonforward matrix elements of lightlike correlation functions of the tensor current. At the leading twist, with the tensor current, four chiral-odd distributions are in count. We calculate these distributions in a diquark spectator model with light-front formalism by considering purely transverse momentum transfer, i.e., zero skewness. Predictions for the nucleons and light hyperons are studied, emphasizing the difference arising from their different quark flavors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of baryons in a spectator diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy momentum tensor (EMT) expresses the interaction between the gravitation and the matter fields, in which the scattering off the graviton is a natural but infeasible probe. However, the EMT can be accessed indirectly through electromagnetic interactions in quantum chromodynamics. The matrix elements of the local EMT operator are parameterized by gravitational form factors, which are subsequently related to the generalized parton distributions. Within the diquark spectator model, we investigate the gravitational form factors of baryons. We consider all the feasible pairs of quark-diquark systems to understand the behavior of each constituent quark flavor of strange and non-strange baryons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the $\Omega(2380)$ resonance and show that it is consistent with a dynamically generated state arising from the $\bar{K}^*\Xi^*$, $\omega\Omega$, and $\phi\Omega$ interactions. In this picture, the $\Omega(2380)$ is analogous to the $\Omega(2012)$, which is generated from the $\bar{K}\Xi^*$ and $\eta\Omega$ channels. The resulting mass, total width, and partial decay widths into the $\bar{K}\Xi^*$ and $\bar{K}^*\Xi$ channels are compatible with the available experimental data. We also discuss possible experimental observables that could provide further insight into the nature of this state.</description>

By incorporating the coupled-channel dynamics between bare quark-model states and the $\pi N$, $\pi\Delta$ and $\eta N$ meson-baryon continua, we examine the mass shifts and structural properties of these excited states. We demonstrate that when the model parameters are calibrated to match the $1P$-wave spectrum and their widths, the pole associated with the bare $2S$ state is naturally shifted downward to the mass region of physical Roper resonance--$N(1440)$, thereby offering a dynamical explanation for the long-standing level-inversion problem. An approximate analysis of compositeness and elementariness reveals that the Roper resonance contains a significant meson-baryon continuum states, consistent with the picture of a bare core heavily dressed by meson-baryon cloud. Simultaneously, the pole positions and properties of five $1P$-wave resonances--$N(1535)$, $N(1650)$, $N(1520)$, $N(1700)$ and $N(1675)$ are successfully reproduced. Our results highlight the essential role of coupled-channel effects in shaping the nucleon spectrum and provide a consistent microscopic insight into the interplay between internal quark degrees of freedom and external hadronic fields.</description>

      <title>From LUXE to Future Colliders: Probing Strong-Field QED and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong-field quantum electrodynamics offers a unique window into non-perturbative phenomena such as vacuum pair production, in which electron--positron pairs are created from the vacuum in the presence of intense electromagnetic fields. The LUXE experiment at DESY is designed to probe this regime using collisions between a high-intensity laser and the 16.5 GeV electron beam of the European XFEL. Future accelerator infrastructures, such as linear colliders, could extend these studies to even higher intensity and energy scales. Additionally, high-energy photons produced in such interactions can be used in beam-dump experiments to search for new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply analytical models to study the property of neutron stars and dark stars. With the aim of exploring the global observable properties of those compact stars, we investigate the total masses and radii, the tidal deformabilities and especially the fundamental (f -) mode oscillations. While we choose two typical models in this work, this method applies to any analytical equations of state. By comparing with the multi-messenger observations, one can constrain the corresponding parameters in those models.</description>

      <title>Discovery prospects of a singly-charged scalar at $\mu$TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the associated production of a singly-charged ($\Delta^+$) scalar along with a $W^+$ boson in the newly proposed $\mu^+\mu^+$ collider (also known as $\mu$TRISTAN) at $\sqrt{s} = 2~$ TeV. Such a singly-charged scalar is naturally accommodated in an extremely well-motivated neutrino mass model, namely, the Type-II seesaw model. This model, beside providing a viable explanation of neutrino mass generation, also allows for lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes. Since LFV processes are not allowed in the Standard Model (SM), we focus on the discovery prospect of the singly-charged scalar in the Type-II seesaw model at $\mu$TRISTAN through a LFV process, owing to the advantage of this process being free of any SM background. Additionally, this article also proposes a method to indicate if the underlying theory follows a Normal or an Inverted hierarchy depending on the distribution of lepton flavors in the final state.</description>

      <title>All-order prescription for facet regions in massless wide-angle scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a step toward answering a long-standing question in the asymptotic expansion of Feynman integrals: how to systematically determine the regions in the Expansion-by-Regions technique for multiscale processes? Focusing on generic massless wide-angle scattering, we provide an all-order momentum-space prescription for facet regions, which generally dominate -- and in most cases exhaust -- the contributions in a given asymptotic expansion. This extends the Euclidean-space picture, where regions correspond to specific subgraphs, to the complexities of Minkowski space. Our results are derived from a novel analytical approach combining graph theory and convex geometry; as a key byproduct, we uncover for the first time the algebraic structure underlying momentum modes (collinear, soft, and their hierarchies).</description>

      <title>Constraining high-energy neutrinos from tidal disruption events with IceCube high-energy starting events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos. Successful and choked jets, as well as the accretion disk, corona, wind, and outflow regions in a TDE have been examined and shown to produce TeV - PeV neutrinos. In this work, we use the IceCube 12.5 year high energy starting events (HESE) dataset and perform a maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal correlations between HESE dataset and a selected sample of 89 TDEs. Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis. Using this result, we place constraints on the fraction of TDEs harboring intrinsic jets ($f_{\rm jet}$) and the corresponding isotropic-equivalent cosmic ray (CR) energy ($\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR}$). We note that even with limited statistics, we can constrain the parameter space as $\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{53}$ erg for $f_{\rm jet} \gtrsim 0.6$ at more than 90% C.L. Finally, we discuss the theoretical implications of our results and the limits on the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux from TDEs. With more observational data in the electromagnetic band for TDEs and neutrino observations from IceCube and KM3NeT, our analysis can be used to place stringent constraints on physical parameters associated with TDEs.</description>

      <title>Proposal to Search for the CP Violating Electromagnetic Vacuum Angle at the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the possibility that evidence for a non-zero value of the CP violating $ \frac{e^2 }{32\pi^2}\theta_{EM} \int d^4 x {\vec E}\cdot {\vec B}$ coupling might be extracted from Event Horizon Telescope observations of the black holes SgA* and M87*. The Fischler-Kundu\cite{FK} effect predicts a universal Hall current in the relaxation of charge falling onto the black hole horizon. We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects. Current data does not appear to be sufficient to perform such a test.</description>

      <title>A Universal CMB $B$-Mode Spectrum from Early Causal Tensor Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict post-inflationary tensor perturbations from causality-limited, sub-horizon sources. While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>The Silver Blaze Problem in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides a pedagogical introduction to the Silver Blaze problem. This problem refers to the difficulty of reconciling to perspectives on QCD with a chemical potential. The first is the phenomenological fact that at $T=0$ QCD remains in its ground state -- the vacuum -- with all physical observables unchanged whenever the magnitude of a chemical potential is less than some critical value. The second is the fact that in functional integral treatments, the inclusion of any nonzero chemical potential changes all eigenvalues of the Dirac operator for every gauge configuration, leading to a natural expectation that the functional determinants also changes, which leads to the expectation that physical observables should be altered. The problem amounts to explaining why nothing happens below the critical chemical potential. By focusing on the eigenvalues of $\gamma_0$ times the Dirac operator rather than the Dirac operator itself, it is possible to show that for QCD with two flavors and identical quark masses, an isospin chemical potential with a magnitude less than $m_\pi$ (and no baryon chemical potential), or a baryon chemical potential of less than $\frac{3}{2} m_\pi$ (and no isospin chemical potential), the functional integerals at $T=0$ themselves remain unchanged in all configurations that contribute to the functional integral with non-vanishing weight. However, for $\mu_{\rm crit}\mu_B &gt; \frac{3}{2} m_\pi$, the Silver Blaze phenomenon arises due to functional determinants having nontrivial phases that lead to cancellations between different gauge configurations. The mechanism leading to such cancellations remains unknown.</description>

      <title>Background instability of quintessence model in light of entropy and distance conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the covariant entropy bound argument supporting the de Sitter swampland conjecture to the quintessence model, to find out the condition for the background to be unstable. More concretely, the background is unstable when the matter entropy given by the species number of the effective field theory increases more rapidly than the geometrical entropy proportional to the apparent horizon area, since it contradicts the covariant entropy bound. The rapid increase in the matter entropy is proposed by the distance conjecture, which states that the time evolution of some scalar field along the geodesic in the field space brings about the descent of a tower of states from UV. From this, we find that for the quintessence model, the accelerating background having the event horizon is unstable, and the instability condition as well as the lifetime of the unstable background is equivalent to the trans-Planckian censorship bound forbidding the classicalization of the trans-Planckian modes. We also point out that the scale separation between the Kaluza-Klein mass scale and the Hubble parameter can be realized when the product between the increasing rates of the matter and the geometrical entropies is bounded from below, which is consistent with the AdS distance conjecture. Our study suggests that various swampland conjectures can be comprehensively understood in the language of the entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature and baryon, charge, and strangeness chemical potentials characterize QCD matter under extreme conditions. Differences between these chemical potentials and their ratios probe conserved-charge correlations and the system's response in the multidimensional QCD phase diagram. We extract these quantities from STAR Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr isobar collisions using a Bayesian thermal analysis of hadron yields, which substantially reduces systematic uncertainties, and compare them with Taylor-expanded lattice-QCD and Chiral Mean Field model predictions. Isobar collisions thus emerge as a precision probe of four-dimensional QCD thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Realizing the phantom-divide crossing with vector and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In generalized Proca theories, characterized by a vector field with broken $U(1)$ gauge invariance, late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized with a dark energy equation of state in the regime $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$. In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_\psi$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_\psi$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>Cone-Dependent Jet Collisional Energy Loss in Finite QCD Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a compact HTL-resummed expression for the leading-order jet collisional energy loss in a finite-size, finite-temperature QCD medium. Defining the jet energy inside a cone of radius $R$, we obtain the out-of-cone elastic energy loss with an explicit separation between contributions from the primary jet parton and recoiling medium partons. The result reproduces the known partonic limit as $R\!\to\!0$, vanishes for $R\!\to\!\pi$, and applies to both light- and heavy-flavor jets. Numerically, the elastic component shows a pronounced non-linear $R$ dependence relative to the radiative baseline, and its importance increases with $R$, becoming comparable to or exceeding the radiative contribution for sufficiently large jet radii. The path-length dependence remains close to linear for all $R$, while the medium-response contribution can exceed $10\%$ for realistic jet radii.</description>

      <title>Gravitational amplitudes in the Regge limit: waveforms, shock waves and unitarity cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the high-energy description of gravitational scattering, we develop a systematic Regge-theory framework for $2\to2+n$ amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive particles with $n$ graviton emissions, including spin effects. Working in the ultra-relativistic limit at leading logarithmic accuracy, the massive result smoothly reduces to its massless counterpart. We describe both quantum (Regge trajectory and BFKL $t$-channel evolution) and classical ($s$-channel multi-$H$ evolution) contributions using both an exponential representation of the S-matrix and a shock-wave formalism in light-cone quantisation. In the latter approach, gravitational Wilson lines evolve in rapidity space under a boost-invariant Hamiltonian, providing a space-time realisation of the high-energy dynamics and making contact with recent effective field theory descriptions in the forward limit. As an application, we compute the leading-logarithmic contribution to the massive spinless $2\to2$ amplitude at 5PM-2SF order, recovering the previously determined massless result, and derive the tree-level $2\to3$ amplitude and its associated scattering waveform for Kerr black holes in the ultra-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Celestial Energy-Energy Correlation in Yang-Mills Theory and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Celestial Energy-Energy Correlator (cEEC), an infrared and collinear safe observable that makes the celestial conformal symmetry of four-dimensional scattering manifest. The cEEC is defined as a correlation function of Average Null Energy operators measured on boost eigenstates, and takes the form of a four-point function in a fictitious two-dimensional CFT on the celestial sphere. An important feature of the cEEC is that it smoothly interpolates between different key regimes of perturbative gauge theory and gravity, such as the collinear limit, the Sudakov limit, and the Regge limit. We compute the cEEC to the first non-trivial order in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, pure Yang-Mills, Einstein gravity, and $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity. In $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity, the cEEC is uniquely determined by celestial symmetries and boundary data, demonstrating that bootstrap methods can yield closed-form results for this class of observables.</description>

Abstract: We perform fully nonlinear, spherically symmetric numerical simulations of superhorizon false-vacuum-domain (FVD) collapse in a coupled gravity-scalar-fluid system to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation during delayed first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). Using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the bubble wall, we identify three dynamical outcomes: type B (supercritical) PBHs with an interior baby universe and a bifurcating trapping horizon, type A (subcritical) PBHs with an apparent horizon formed by direct wall collapse, and dispersal with no PBH formation. To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $\delta(t_\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing. For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V} \gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $\delta(t_\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $\delta_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $\delta_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of FVD collapse, quantify practical PBH-formation thresholds, and pave the way for precise predictions of PBH abundance from delayed FOPTs.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations in hydrodynamics and quantum long-time tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a quantum Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective field theory for the diffusive hydrodynamics of a conserved scalar field. Quantum corrections within the SK framework are guided by fluctuation-dissipation relations, enforced via a dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) symmetry. We find that the KMS symmetry necessarily generates fluctuation contributions in the SK effective action at all orders in the noise field, thereby giving rise to intrinsically non-Gaussian noise. We use our results to compute one-loop quantum corrections to the two-point density-density retarded correlation function, leading to a quantum generalization of hydrodynamic long-time tails. Our results apply at arbitrarily high orders in $\hbar$. The one-loop results for retarded correlation functions have been expressed in terms of a family of polynomials. We also provide a closed-form expression for the one-loop results at leading order in the wavevector expansion.</description>

      <title>Neural S-matrix bootstrap II: solvable 4d amplitudes with particle production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model for nonperturbative unitarization of the four-point contact scalar amplitude in four dimensions. It is defined through an infinite sum of planar diagrams, constructed using two-particle unitarity and crossing symmetry. We reformulate the problem in terms of a set of nonlinear integral equations obeyed by the single and double discontinuities of the amplitude. We then solve them using a neural-network ansatz trained by minimizing a physics-informed loss functional. We obtain a one-parameter family of amplitudes, which exhibit rich structure: sizeable particle production, nontrivial emergent Regge behavior, Landau curves, a logarithmic decay at high energy and fixed angle. Finally, we go beyond the two-particle-reducible setup by treating the multi-particle data -- supported above the multi-particle Landau curves due to multi-particle unitarity -- as a dynamical variable. We demonstrate that it can be tuned to suppress low-spin particle production -- a phenomenon we call Aks screening -- at the cost of generating larger and oscillatory double spectral density in the multi-particle region.</description>

      <title>Dark matter with exotic mediators: The diquark portal</title>

Abstract: In this work we build out complete mediator sectors for models of frustrated dark matter (fDM), a new paradigm in which fermionic dark matter couples to the Standard Model (SM) through a scalar-fermionic mediator pair. The fDM paradigm allows great freedom in the charge assignments of the mediators: it accommodates any representation of the SM gauge group provided that the scalar and fermionic mediators have the same charges. In this paper, we write down all renormalizable models in which the mediator(s) make contact with the SM through pairs of quarks, a model space we refer to as the diquark portal. The mediators in this portal may be singlets, triplets, sextets, or octets of the color group $\mathrm{SU}(3)_{\text{c}}$. The mediators may additionally be in non-trivial representations of the weak group $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$, including doublet and triplet representations, depending on the mediators' color charge. In addition to writing the complete set of renormalizable Lagrangians, we categorize the general collider phenomenology of the models and discuss pair- and single-production LHC signatures of the mediator sectors.</description>

      <title>Threshold resummation for $Z$-boson pair production at NNLO+NNLL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of a pair of on-shell $Z$-bosons is an important process at the Large Hadron Collider. Owing to its large production cross section at the LHC, this process is very useful for SM precision studies, electroweak symmetry breaking sector as well as to unravel the possible new physics. In this work, we have performed the threshold resummation of the large logarithms that arise in the partonic threshold limit $z \to 1$, up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. The presence of the two-loop contributions in the process dependent resummation coefficient $g_0$ makes the numerical computation a non-trivial task. After matching the resummed predictions to the Next-to-Next-to-Leading order (NNLO) fixed order results, we present the invariant mass distribution to NNLO+NNLL accuracy in QCD for the current LHC energies. We find that in the high invariant mass region ($Q=1$ TeV), while the NNLO corrections are as large as $83\%$ with respect to the leading order, the NNLL contribution enhances the cross section by additional few percent, about $4\%$ for $13.6$ TeV LHC. In this invariant mass region, the conventional scale uncertainties in the fixed order results get reduced from $3.4\%$ at NNLO to about $2.6\%$ at NNLO+NNLL, and this reduction is expected to be more for higher $Q$ values.</description>

Abstract: The interference between amplitudes corresponding to different intermediate resonances plays an important role in generating large CP asymmetries in phase space in multi-body decays of bottom and charmed mesons. In this paper, we study the CP violation in the decay channel ${\overline{B}}^{0}\rightarrow K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$ in phase space region where the intermediate resonances $\overline{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$ and ${\overline{K}^{*}_{0}(700)}$ dominate. The Forward-Backward Asymmetry (FBA) and the CP asymmetry induced by FBA (FB-CPA), which are closely related to the interference effects between the two aforementioned resonances, are especially investigated. The non-trivial correlation between FBA and FB-CPA is analyzed. The analysis indicates that the FB-CPAs around the resonance $\overline{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$ can be as large as about 35\%, which can be potentially accessible by Belle and Belle-II collaborations in the near future.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar Higgs boson decay to three parton amplitudes at NNLO to higher orders in the dimensional regulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present for the first time the second-order corrections of pseudo-scalar($A$) Higgs decay to three parton to higher orders in the dimensional regulator. We compute the one and two-loop amplitudes for processes, $A\to ggg$ and $A\to q\bar{q}g$ in the effective theory framework. With suitable crossing of the external momenta, these calculations are well-suited for predicting the differential distribution of pseudo-scalar Higgs in association with a jet at hadron colliders, up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling constant. These results expanded to higher orders in dimensional regulator will contribute to the full three loop cross section. We implement the finite pieces of the amplitudes in a numerical code which can be used with any Monte Carlo phase space generator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis is compelling yet challenging to probe because of the high-energy physics involved. We demonstrate that this mechanism can be generically realized with low-energy new physics, without supersymmetry, while producing detectable gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the parametric resonance of a light scalar field. In viable models, the scalar has a mass of $\mathcal{O}(0.1-10)$ GeV, yielding GWs with peak frequencies of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ Hz. This study further reveals a new complementarity between upcoming LIGO-frequency GW detectors and laboratory searches across frontiers of particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore how the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I, extended by an inert doublet, can provide an explanation for the recently observed excesses at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the $\gamma\gamma$ and $\tau^+ \tau^- $ final states. Hence, by imposing theoretical constraints and experimental bounds on the model parameter space, our findings show that a light CP-even Higgs boson, $h$, with a mass around 95 GeV, can account for these anomalies. This result aligns with the excess in $b\bar b$ signatures reported in earlier data from the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillations as a Probe of Macrorealism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlations between successive measurements of a quantum system can violate a family of Leggett-Garg Inequalities (LGIs) that are analogous to the violation of Bell's inequalities of measurements performed on spatially separated quantum systems. These LGIs follow from a macrorealistic point of view, imposing that a classical system is at all times in a definite state and that a measurement can, at least in principle, leave this state undisturbed. Violations of LGIs can be probed by neutrino flavour oscillations if the correlators of consecutive flavour measurements are approximately stationary. We discuss here several improvements of the methodology used in previous analyses based on accelerator and reactor neutrino data. We argue that the strong claims of LGI violations made in previous studies are based on an unsuitable modelling of macrorealistic systems in statistical hypothesis tests. We illustrate our improved methodology via the example of the MINOS muon-neutrino survival data, where we find revised statistical evidence for violations of LGIs at the $(2-3)\sigma$ level, depending on macrorealistic background models.</description>

      <title>Threshold resummation for $W$-boson pair production at NNLO+NNLL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for threshold resummation of the invariant mass distribution, for on-shell production of a pair of $W$-bosons at next-to-next-to-leading order + next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLO+NNLL) accuracy in QCD. Owing to its sensitivity to the self-interactions between gauge bosons, this process is important to investigate at the energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We achieve this resummation by exploiting the factorization properties of the soft and virtual parts of the partonic cross-section. Our analysis has been carried out for the invariant mass distribution up to $Q$ = 2500 GeV. At this highest $Q$ we find that, for 13.6 TeV LHC, the NNLL resummation enhances the NNLO cross-sections by about $6.3\%$ and reduces the conventional scale uncertainties from 6.8\% at NNLO to 4.1\% at NNLO+NNLL. We also estimate the intrinsic uncertainties due to the non-perturbative parton distribution functions at the highest perturbative order, for both fixed-order and resummed results, to be around 3\% for $Q \sim$ 2000 GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, systematic method for the complete symbolic reduction of multi-loop Feynman integrals, leveraging the power of generating functions. The differential equations governing these generating functions naturally yield symbolic recurrence relations. We develop an efficient algorithm that utilizes these recurrences to reduce integrals to a minimal set of master integrals. This approach circumvents the exponential growth of traditional integration-by-parts relations, enabling the reduction of high-rank, multi-loop integrals critical for state-of-the-art calculations in perturbative quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Multi-parton contributions to $\bar B \to X_s \gamma$ at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many contributions to the decay rate of the inclusive radiative $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s \gamma$ transition have been calculated to NNLO in QCD during the past decades. However, there are still a few unknown contributions from multi-parton final states which are formally NLO. In the present work, we compute those four-body $b \rightarrow s\, q\, \bar{q}\,\gamma$ contributions at NLO in QCD which need to be supplemented by the five-body $b \rightarrow s\, q\, \bar{q}\, g\,\gamma $ bremsstrahlung. This calculation formally completes the purely perturbative contributions to $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s \gamma$ at NLO. Our results are obtained by applying modern techniques of integral reduction and evaluation of master integrals. In particular, the analytic integration over the four and five-particle phase space in the presence of a cut on the photon energy turns out to be technically involved. We give our results completely analytically in terms of multiple polylogarithms, including the dependence on the collinear logarithms which arise from the mass-regularisation of collinear divergences. The numerical impact of multi-parton corrections on the $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s \gamma$ decay rate turns out to be small, owing to a partial cancellation between LO and NLO contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first evaluation of virtual resonance contributions to the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies, focusing on the dominant $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. We approximate the vector part of the $N \to \Delta$ transition by the leading magnetic dipole term. Our results for the cross-section corrections at fixed neutrino energy indicate the permille-level contribution of resonance intermediate states to the elastic and radiative scattering cross sections. This calculation exhibits the expected infrared behavior of the invariant amplitudes and unpolarized cross sections. Our findings provide important insights into inelastic excitations in the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies.</description>

      <title>Updating GUT-Scale Pole Higgs Inflation After ACT DR6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider models of chaotic inflation driven by the real parts of a conjugate pair of Higgs superfields involved in the spontaneous breaking of a grand unification symmetry at a scale assuming its value within MSSM. We combine a superpotential, which is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R symmetry, with two fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potentials introducing two free parameters (p,N). The inflationary observables provide an excellent match to the recent ACT data for 1.355&lt;=p&lt;=6.7 and 6x10^-5&lt;= N&lt;=0.7. The attainment of inflation allows for subplanckian inflaton values and possibly detectable primordial gravitational waves with (p,N) values of order unity. A solution to the mu problem of MSSM and baryogenesis via non-thermal leptogenesis can be also accommodated by embedding the model into a B-L extension of MSSM.</description>

      <title>Thermal photon emission from quark-gluon plasma: 1+1D magnetohydrodynamics results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate thermal photon production in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) under strong magnetic fields using a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) framework. Adopting the Bjorken flow model with power-law decaying magnetic fields $\mathbf{B}(\tau) = \mathbf{B}_0 (\tau_0/\tau)^a$ (where $a$ controls the decay rate, $B_0 = \sqrt{\sigma} T_0^2$, and $\sigma$ characterizes the initial field strength), we employ relativistic ideal fluid dynamics under the non-resistive approximation. The resulting QGP temperature evolution exhibits distinct $a$- and $\sigma$-dependent behaviors. Thermal photon production rates are calculated for three dominant processes: Compton scattering with $q\bar{q}$ annihilation (C+A), bremsstrahlung (Brems), and $q\bar{q}$ annihilation with additional scattering (A+S). These rates are integrated over the space-time volume to obtain the photon transverse momentum $(p_T)$ spectrum. Our results demonstrate that increasing $a$ enhances photon yields across all $p_T$, with $a \to \infty$ (super-fast decay) providing an upper bound. For $a = 2/3$, larger $\sigma$ suppresses yields through accelerated cooling, whereas for $a \to \infty$, larger $\sigma$ enhances yields via prolonged thermal emission. Low-$p_T$ photons receive significant contributions from all QGP evolution stages, while high-$p_T$ photons originate predominantly from early times. The central rapidity region $(y=0)$ dominates the total yield. This work extends photon yield studies to the MHD regime under strong magnetic fields, elucidating magnetic field effects on QGP electromagnetic signatures and establishing foundations for future investigations of magnetization and dissipative phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich analytic structure of hadronic form factors makes a theoretically consistent yet easily applicable parametrisation cumbersome. Consequently, most parametrisations are limited to reproducing the simplest analytic features sufficient to describe form factors on their first Riemann sheet. Here, we introduce two novel form factor parametrisations that allow resonance poles and left-hand cuts on the second Riemann sheet to be studied, while also making the connection to partial-wave amplitudes manifest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent reformulation of top-quark condensation for the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, we introduced an extended internal wave-function, $\phi(r)$. We show how this leads to a manifestly Lorentz invariant formalism, where the absence of ``relative time'' is a gauge invariance of the bilocal field theory. This dictates a novel and nontrivial Lorentz invariant vacuum structure for the BEH boson, the relativistic generalization of a condensed matter state such as a BCS condensate.</description>

      <title>Untangling PBH overproduction in $w$-SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays for MST-EFT of single field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15065v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work highlights the crucial role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the context of single field inflation with Multiple Sharp Transitions (MSTs) to untangle the current state of the PBH overproduction issue. We examine the situation for a broad interval of EoS parameter that remains most favourable to explain the recent data released by the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaboration. Our analysis yields the interval, $0.2 \leq w \leq 1/3$, to be the most acceptable window from the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal and where sizeable PBHs abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$, is observed. We also obtain $w=1/3$, radiation-dominated era, to be the best scenario to explain the early stages of the Universe and address the overproduction problem. Within the range of $1 \leq c_{s} \leq 1.17$, we construct a regularized-renormalized-resummed scalar power spectrum whose amplitude obeys the perturbativity criterion while being substantial enough to generate EoS dependent scalar induced gravitational waves ($w$-SIGWs) consistent with NANOGrav-15 data. Working for both $c_{s} = 1\;{\rm and}\;1.17$, we find the $c_{s}=1.17$ case more favourable for generating large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, as potential dark matter candidates with substantial abundance after constraints coming from microlensing experiments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. While we confirm all details of the existing literature, we highlight a potentially important point which may provide a better understanding of and insights on the quantization of gauged systems. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as ``sandwich conditions'': The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and the implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>

      <title>The neural networks with tensor weights and emergent fermionic Wick rules in the large-width limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complex-valued neural network (CVNNs) with tensor-valued hidden-to-output weights within the framework of neural-network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). For standard CVNNs with scalar weights, we derive the generating functional and identify the exact Gaussian process that arises in the infinite-width limit, together with its associated effective quantum state. When the last-layer weights are promoted to Clifford-algebra-valued tensors, the network output becomes complex matrix-valued, and a fermion-like sign structure in the large-width correlation functions of the network output is induced. We show that, in the infinite-width limit, correlators with equal numbers of $f^{\dag}$ and $f$ obey fermionic Wick rules and can be written as determinants built from a scalar Euclidean kernel $S(x,y)=\langle f^{\dag}(x)f(y)\rangle$. This provides a sign-structured extension of NN-QFT at the level of Euclidean correlators and Feynman rules, even though a microscopic Grassmann path integral representation for the network parameters has not yet been constructed. Our analysis thus pushes the NN-QFT correspondence beyond purely bosonic Gaussian fields and suggests a possible route to encoding fermion-like symmetries in neural architectures for QFT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields with masses protected by global shift symmetries, commonly referred to as axions, are abundantly used in effective field theories in cosmology and particle physics. However, global symmetries cannot be expected to be protected at the fundamental level. Finding consistent ultra-violet completions for axions is therefore a necessity. In this work, we identify the axion with the position mode of a charged 3-brane in (4+1)-dimensions. The shift symmetry of the axion is then a residual diffeomorphism in the fifth dimension orthogonal to the brane. Meanwhile, the brane is coupled to a flux in the fifth dimension. From the (3+1)-dimensional perspective, this construction generates (perturbatively) a mass for the axion and matches previously known proposals in the literature based on the coupling between the axion and a three-form gauge field. In a second step, we uplift this (4+1)-dimensional model to M-theory, where the same three-form is found to couple to the membrane with a (2+1)-dimensional worldvolume. In particular, our proposal also elucidates the duality between the axion and a two-form gauge field in the literature. We show that this dual two-form couples to the boundary of an open membrane in M-theory. Finally, we comment on the relations to and differences from other closed and open string axion monodromy models.</description>

      <title>Nonradial oscillations of stratified neutron stars with solid crusts: Mode characterization and tidal resonances in coalescing binaries</title>

Abstract: Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals provide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and potentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\sim 10^{-3},\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Vector Horndeski black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a spherically symmetric and static background, we study the existence of linearly stable black hole (BH) solutions in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) with a Horndeski vector-tensor (HVT) coupling, with and without curvature singularities at the center ($r=0$). Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$ and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field. Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling ($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$. Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordstr\"om form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH instability in the high-curvature regime.</description>

Abstract: False vacuum decay typically proceeds via the nucleation of spherical bubbles of true vacuum, described by $O(4)$ symmetric field configurations in Euclidean time. In this work, we investigate how the presence of cosmic strings can catalyze the decay process. To this end, we consider a complex scalar field charged under a global or local $U(1)$ symmetry. Assuming a non-trivial vacuum manifold, realizable for example in a simple sextic potential, we derive relativistic bounce solutions with $O(2) \times O(2)$ symmetry, corresponding to elongated bubbles seeded by a cosmic string of the same scalar field. Building up on earlier results in the literature, we identify the region of parameter space where vacuum decay predominantly proceeds via this alternative channel, thereby providing an explicit mechanism for the quantum decay of cosmic strings. Finally, we present an initial discussion of the gravitational wave signal associated with this type of vacuum decay and its possible connection to the recently observed stochastic signal in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

Abstract: It was recently shown that the time variation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves from pulsars can be used, in cross-correlation with pulsar timing, to probe the chirality of an isotropic gravitational wave background. Here, we show that the expression for the cross-correlation is derived efficiently with the total-angular-momentum formalism and use this framework to extend the formulation to cross-correlation with astrometry. We do so for spin-1 gravitational waves (that may arise in alternative-gravity theories) as well as the general-relativistic spin-2 gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>EFT Perspective On de-Sitter S-Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative limitations on low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) based on the characteristics of high-energy theory are provided by the analyticity of the flat-space version of the S-matrix. Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions.</description>
