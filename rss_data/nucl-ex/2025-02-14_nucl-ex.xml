      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation of five $\alpha$ clusters in $^{20}$Ne and supersolidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the five $\alpha$ cluster states recently observed in $^{20}$Ne, slightly above the five $\alpha$ threshold energy, are Bose-Einstein condensates of five $\alpha$ clusters. The states are described well using a superfluid cluster model, where the order parameter is defined. We suggest that the the five $\alpha$ states are fragmented. Theory predicts the emergence of a five $\alpha$ rotational roton band characterized by a large moment of inertia. This band is formed through roton excitations of the five $\alpha$ BEC vacuum and possesses dual properties of superfluidity and crystallinity, a property of supersolidity. The persistent existence of such a roton bandis discussed and confirmed for the four $\alpha$ condensate above the four $\alpha$ threshold in $^{16}$O and the three $\alpha$ condensate above the three $\alpha$ threshold in $^{12}$C.</description>

      <title>Jet and jet substructure: ALICE results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jets and their substructure in pp collisions offer a unique opportunity to probe various aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), ranging from perturbative QCD (pQCD) tests to studies of non-perturbative phenomena such as hadronization. They also probe the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. In heavy-ion collisions, jets serve as a novel tool to investigate the microscopic properties of the deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Recently, significant progress has been made in developing jet substructure observables to explore these properties. The ALICE experiment is particularly well-suited for jet measurements due to its high-precision tracking system, which is especially beneficial for detecting low transverse momentum jets. This contribution will highlight recent ALICE measurements of inclusive and semi-inclusive jets, along with various jet substructure observables in pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions. The comparisons between data and predictions from Monte Carlo (MC) models as well as analytical calculations will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Imaging of Pion using Lattice QCD: Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a lattice calculation of $x$-dependent valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness with multiple values of the momentum transfer $-t$. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensemble of highly improved staggered quarks with Wilson-Clover valence fermion. The lattice spacing is 0.04 fm, and the pion valence mass is tuned to be 300 MeV. We determine the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes of the quasi-GPD matrix elements for both symmetric and asymmetric momenta transfers with similar values and show the equivalence of both frames. Then, focusing on the asymmetric frame, we utilize a hybrid scheme to renormalize the quasi-GPD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculations. After the Fourier transforms, the quasi-GPDs are then matched to the light-cone GPDs within the framework of large momentum effective theory with improved matching, including the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections, and leading renormalon and renormalization group resummations. We also present the 3-dimensional image of the pion in impact-parameter space through the Fourier transform of the momentum transfer $-t$.</description>

      <title>Low-threshold response of a scintillating xenon bubble chamber to nuclear and electronic recoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A device filled with pure xenon first demonstrated the ability to operate simultaneously as a bubble chamber and scintillation detector in 2017. Initial results from data taken at thermodynamic thresholds down to ~4 keV showed sensitivity to ~20 keV nuclear recoils with no observable bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-ray interactions. This paper presents results from further operation of the same device at thermodynamic thresholds as low as 0.50 keV, hardware limited. The bubble chamber has now been shown to have sensitivity to ~1 keV nuclear recoils while remaining insensitive to bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-rays. A robust calibration of the chamber's nuclear recoil nucleation response, as a function of nuclear recoil energy and thermodynamic state, is presented. Stringent upper limits are established for the probability of bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-ray-induced Auger cascades, with a limit of $&lt;1.1\times10^{-6}$ set at 0.50 keV, the lowest thermodynamic threshold explored.</description>

      <title>Investigation and optimization of the deconvolution method for PMT waveform reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are extensively employed as photosensors in neutrino and dark matter detection. The precise charge and timing information extracted from the PMT waveform plays a crucial role in energy and vertex reconstruction. In this study, we investigate the deconvolution algorithm utilized for PMT waveform reconstruction, while enhancing the timing separation ability for pile-up hits by redesigning filters based on the time-frequency uncertainty principle. This filter design sacrifices signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve narrower pulse widths. Furthermore, we optimize the selection of signal pulses in the case of low SNR based on Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Monte Carlo data confirms that our optimization yields enhanced reconstruction performance: improving timing separation ability for pile-up hits from $7\sim10$~ns to $3\sim5$~ns, while controlling the residual nonlinearity of charge reconstruction to about 1\% in the range of 0 to 20 photoelectrons.</description>

      <title>Pion Nuclear Fragmentation Functions Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the notion of nuclear parton-to-pion fragmentation functions at next-to-leading order accuracy as an effective description of hadroproduction in nuclear environments such as in semi-inclusive lepton-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering and in single inclusive proton-nucleus collisions. We assess their viability in the face of very precise data collected for the latter at the CERN-LHC over the past decade as well as recent measurements of the former carried out by the CLAS experiment at JLab.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations in Au+Au collisions from a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-by-event mean transverse momentum fluctuations ($\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$) serve as a sensitive probe of initial state overlap geometry and energy density fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We present a systematic investigation of $\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$ fluctuations in \auau collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}} =$3.0-19.6 GeV, examining their centrality and energy dependence with the framework of an improved multiphase transport (AMPT) model. The centrality dependence of the $p_\mathrm{T}$ cumulants up to fourth order deviates significantly from simple powering-law scaling. Scaled cumulants are performed, with variances aligning well with the trends observed in the experimental data. Employing a two-subevent method, short-range correlations are slightly suppressed compared to the standard approach. Furthermore, baryons exhibit more pronounced $\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$ fluctuations than mesons, potentially attributable to the effect of radial flow. These results provide referenced insights into the role of initial state fluctuations across different energies in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal flow decorrelations in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed analysis of longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions at both Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider(LHC) energies, focusing on various \textit{ab-initio} models of oxygen structure. We identify that the correlator $V_{2\Delta}$ effectively differentiates between the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) structure and other models, such as Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM), revealing similar behaviors between the latter two. By utilizing the isolated non-spherical components, we highlight significant negative contributions in the structure generated by VMC compared to the other configurations. Additionally, we show that employing decorrelation $r_2$ to mitigate non-flow effects proves beneficial in identifying various modeled structures. We further examine flow decorrelations across different systems, including d+Au and O+O collisions at 200 GeV, as well as Ne+Ne and O+O collisions at 6.37 TeV, indicating a hierarchy in decorrelations that underscores the complexity of these interactions. Our findings emphasize that the role of asymmetry in d+Au collisions and its impact on flow correlations is mitigated by the correlator $V_{2\Delta} (\eta, \eta_{\text{ref}} )$. Additionally, our analysis of flow angle decorrelations shows diverse distributions of $\cos(2\Delta\psi_2)$ vs. overall flow magnitude in d+Au collisions compared to those in other collision systems, as indicated by the mean value of $\cos(2\Delta\psi_2)$.</description>

      <title>Directly probing existence of $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{20}$Ne by relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can relativistic heavy-ion collisions only probe the global shape of colliding nuclei, or their detailed internal structure as well? Taking $^{20}$Ne as an example, we attempt to directly probe its internal $\alpha$-cluster structure, by comparing experimentally measured observables in collisions at relativistic energies from density distributions of $^{20}$Ne with and without $\alpha$-cluster structure. Since the two density distributions give the same nucleus size and deformation, they lead to similar mid-rapidity observables. However, the $\alpha$-cluster structure may considerably reduce the free spectator nucleon yield and enhance the spectator light nuclei yield, as a result of more compact initial phase-space distribution of nucleons inside $\alpha$ clusters. We propose to measure the scaled yield ratio of free spectator neutrons to charged particles with mass-to-charge ratio $A/Z = 3$, 3/2, and 2 in ultra-central $^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne collisions, which is found to be reduced by about $25\%$ at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 7$ TeV and about $20\%$ at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV with $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{20}$Ne. This scaled yield ratio thus serves as a robust and direct probe of the existence of $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{20}$Ne free from the uncertainty of mid-rapidity dynamics.</description>
