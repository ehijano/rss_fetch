      <title>Observing Dark Matter Decays to Gravitons via Graviton-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since dark matter is only known to have gravitational interactions, it may plausibly decay to gravitons on cosmological timescales. Although such a scenario can be easily realized, there are currently no known limits on this possibility based on indirect detection searches. We find that the gravitons produced in dark matter decays can convert to photons in large-scale magnetic fields along the line of sight to an observer. These conversions primarily occur within cosmological filaments which occupy a large (order unity) volume fraction and contain $\sim 10-100$ nG fields with $\sim$ Mpc coherence lengths. Thus, dark matter decays to gravitons predict an irreducible population of extragalactic $\textit{photons}$, which we constrain using the extragalactic gamma-ray background measured by the $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT telescope. Using this conservative method, we place the first limits on the dark matter lifetime in the $0.1 {\rm GeV} - 10^8$ GeV mass range, assuming only decays to gravitons. We also make projections for the Advanced Particle-astrophysics Telescope, which can improve sensitivity to this DM decay channel by an order of magnitude beyond those we set using $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic pressure and novel first-order phase transition in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior and phase diagram of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$ in Euclidean spacetime using an effective model. In our approach, the Polyakov loops along the compactified directions are treated as dynamic variables, and the model is calibrated to match lattice simulation results for thermodynamic observables on $\mathbb{T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$. Our analysis reveals a novel first-order phase transition in the deconfined phase that ends at critical points, which appear to belong to the two-dimensional $Z_2$ universality class. This transition is driven by the interplay between the two Polyakov loops, introduced via a cross-term in the Polyakov-loop potential.</description>

      <title>Impact of new invisible particles on $B\to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent Belle II measurement that suggests an excess in the rare decay $B \to K\, E_{\rm miss}$, and building upon our recent differential decay rate likelihood analysis of the existing experimental information, we investigate possible new physics (NP) scenarios in which light invisible states participate in flavour-changing $b \to s$ transitions. In particular, we consider the total and differential $B\to K^* E_{\rm miss}$ decay rates and $K^*$ polarisation effects in each NP scenario preferred by the $B\to K E_{\rm miss}$ measurement. We show that future measurements of these $B \to K^* E_{\rm miss}$ observables will offer decisive discrimination among the different NP explanations. Our results highlight the strong complementarity of the rare semi-invisible $b$-hadron decay observables, and underline the importance of analysing their momentum transfer spectra when probing extensions of the Standard Model that feature new light degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Minimal renormalizable $SO(10)$, spontaneous CP violation, and flavor implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these proceedings, we summarize our recent findings on a minimal renormalizable $SO(10)$ grand unified theory. With the assumption of spontaneous $CP$ violation, the low-energy theory becomes a constrained two-Higgs-doublet model, whose mass spectrum has an upper bound of 545 GeV. High-luminosity collider experiments may find its flavor violating signals and reveal hidden mixing parameters, enabling new predictions for proton decay. There is a possibility that a hint of minimal $SO(10)$ can appear soon in near future experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing Z/W Pole Physics at High-energy Muon Colliders via Vector-boson-fusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A future $e^+e^-$ collider could run at the Z-pole to perform important electroweak (EW) precision measurements, while such a run may not be viable for a future muon collider. This however can be compensated by the measurements of other EW processes, taking advantage of the high energy and large luminosity of the muon collider. In this paper, we consider the measurements of the vector boson fusion processes to a pair of fermions (along with a $\nu_{\mu}\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ or $\nu_{\mu}\mu^+/\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\mu^-$ pair) at a high-energy muon collider and study their potential in probing the EW observables. We consider two run scenarios for the muon collider with center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV and 30 TeV, respectively, and focus on the processes involving $f=b,c,\tau$ and the dimension-6 operators that directly modify the corresponding fermions coupling to the $Z/W$ bosons. The invariant mass distribution of the $f\bar{f}$ pair help separating the events from the $Z/W$ resonance and the high-energy ones, while the polar angle of the outing fermion also provides additional information. By performing a chi-squared analysis on the binned distributions and combining the information from the $WW$ and $WZ/W\gamma$ fusion processes, all relevant Wilson coefficients can be constrained simultaneously. The precision surpasses the current EW measurement constraints and is even competitive with future $e^+e^-$ colliders. Our analysis can be included in a more complete framework which is needed to fully determine the potential of muon colliders in EW precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Quark antenna in early stage anisotropic QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The states of matter produced in the early stage of heavy ion collisions can be highly anisotropic. If such a feature is sufficiently pronounced, one should expect the final particle distribution inside jets to reflect it in the form of non-trivial angle correlations. In this talk, we discuss a first step in exploring such correlations by studying how a $q\bar q$ state produced from an initial unpolarized gluon couples to the anisotropies of an underlying static QCD medium. The medium anisotropy is captured by allowing the jet quenching parameter to take different magnitudes in two orthogonal directions in the plane transverse to the jet axis. We find that the final particle distribution is sensitive to the medium anisotropy in the form of an azimuthal angle modulation, and more importantly, that this effect couples directly to the helicity/spin of the final states, offering a novel way to extract the details of the underlying matter which is not accessible with standard jet observables. We further show how such features can be extracted from the Fourier decomposition of the distribution and from final state transverse spin polarization measurements.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently announced the detection of a neutrino with energy 220 PeV. The highest-energy neutrino ever measured, this observation is difficult to reconcile with known cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms. One possible source of ultra-high-energy particles is the rapid, violent emission of energetic Hawking radiation from a primordial black hole (PBH) near the end of its evaporation lifetime. Realistic formation mechanisms that would produce a population of PBHs very early in cosmic history yield a mass distribution with a power-law tail for small masses; members of such a population that formed with initial mass $M_* = 5.34 \times 10^{14} {\rm g}$ would be undergoing late-stage evaporation today. We find that recent high-energy neutrino events detected by the IceCube and KM3NeT Collaborations, with energies in the range ${\cal O} (1 - 10^2) \, {\rm PeV}$, are consistent with event-rate expectations if a significant fraction of the dark matter consists of PBHs that obey a well-motivated mass distribution compatible with current evaporation constraints.</description>

      <title>A new type of lepton seesaw model in a modular $A_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new type of lepton seesaw model introducing a modular $A_4$ flavor symmetry in which isospin doublet vector fermions play an important role in constructing seesaw mechanisms for both the charged-lepton mass matrix and the neutrino one. The charged-lepton mass matrix is induced via the Dirac seesaw with a two-by-two block mass matrix. On the other hand, the neutrino mass matrix is generated via a seesaw with four-by-four block mass matrix where the right-handed neutral fermions are also added. Remarkably the neutral fermion mass matrix provides us a new type of seesaw formula for active neutrino mass. Through our chi square analysis, we find some tendencies about observables focusing on two fixed points $\tau=i,\ \omega$.</description>

      <title>The $Z_c(3900)$ in hadronic molecule and triangle singularity at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying exotic hadrons is a challenge against the conventional quark model, providing us with a good platform to deepen our understanding of the strong interaction. An inclusive study of the exotic hadrons in vacuum and at finite temperature is an intriguing approach to shed light on their nature. As a first step, we study the $Z_c(3900)$ in both the $D\bar{D}^\ast$ hadronic molecular and the triangle singularity pictures, and discuss the behaviors of $Z_c(3900)$ at finite temperature in these two different pictures. As the result, we show the properties that its mass becomes smaller and its width becomes larger when the temperature increases, which are seen commonly in the hadronic molecular picture and in the triangle singularity picture. The enhanced widths in hot medium indicate that the $Z_c(3900)$ will be dissociated at sufficiently high temperature. This feature is also reflected by the decrease of the effective couplings in the hadronic molecular picture. It is concluded that, not only in vacuum but also in hot medium, the behaviors of $Z_{c}(3900)$ are similar in the two different interpretations of $Z_c(3900)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct relativised mock meson states for heavy quarkonium, where the Dirac spinors import kinetic relativistic correction and the dynamic wave functions are the same as those solved from Schr\"odinger equation. We find that the kinetic relativistic correction imported by Dirac spinors is crucial to study the two-photon transion form factors. Using relativised mock meson states, we give credible predictions for the two-photon transition form factors and decay widths of $\eta_{c,b}(n^1S_0)$ and $\chi_{c,b}(n^3P_0)$ ($n=1,2,3$).</description>

      <title>Theoretical Uncertainties in First-Order Electroweak Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate theoretical uncertainties in perturbative analyses of first-order electroweak phase transitions (EWPT). Utilizing the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, we quantify the gauge dependence, renormalization scheme, and scale dependences in predicting phase-transition parameters across both zero and finite chemical potential regimes. Our key findings reveal that: 1) the gauge-parameter dependence and the chemical potential are subdominants, and 2) Baryon number preservation criteria and phase transition observables exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the renormalization scale in the ${\overline{\rm MS}}$ scheme. Comparative analyses with the on-shell scheme demonstrate that within strongly first-order EWPT parameter spaces, the ${\overline{\rm MS}}$ scheme predicts enhanced phase transition strengths and prolonged transition durations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter may accumulate in neutron stars given its gravitational interaction and abundance. We investigate the modification of neutron star properties and confront them with the observations in the context of strongly-interacting dark matter scenario, specifically for a QCD-like theory with G$_2$ gauge group for which a first-principles equation-of-state from lattice calculations is available. We study the impact of various observational constraints and modeling of the QCD equation of state on the combined neutron stars. The results indicate that dark matter masses of a few hundred MeV to a few GeV are consistent with the latest observed neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring Efimov states in $D^*D^*D^*$ and $DD^*D^*$ three-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Efimov effect is an intriguing three-body quantum phenomenon. Searching for Efimov states within the realms of nuclear and hadronic physics presents a challenge due to the inherent inability of natural physical systems to exhibit adjustable two-body scattering lengths. In this study, we examine the potential existence of Efimov states in the $D^*D^*D^*$ and $DD^*D^*$ three-hadron systems. Utilizing a pionless effective field theory framework, we determine that the presence of Efimov states in the spectrum of the $D^*D^*D^*$ system is contingent upon the existence of an $(I,J)=(1,2)$ $D^*D^*$ two-body bound system. If only the $T_{cc}^+$ and its heavy quark spin partner $T_{cc}^{*+}$ exist while there is no near-threshold pole in all other $S$-wave $D^{(*)}D^*$ scattering amplitudes, no Efimov effect is expected in the $D^{(*)}D^*D^*$ systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in the Early Universe: Impacts on BBN and CMB Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of low-scale cosmological first-order phase transitions on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy and distortion. We examine two scenarios: the distribution of the phase-transition energy in the cosmic background and the phase transition as an additional source of energy injection. Our analysis reveals that the CMB spectrum from the Planck 2018 dataset imposes stringent constraints on sub-MeV-scale phase transitions, while keV-scale phase transitions can induce significant CMB distortions. Consequently, BBN and CMB observables serve as complementary tools to constrain phase-transition parameters, alongside gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>The role of chiral symmetry and the non-ordinary $\kappa/K^*_0(700)$ nature in $\pi^\pm K_S$ femtoscopic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the use of realistic $\pi K$ interactions, obtained from a dispersive analysis of scattering data, as well as relativistic corrections, are essential to describe recently observed $\pi^\pm K_S$ femtoscopic correlations. We demonstrate that the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking dynamics and the non-ordinary features of the $\kappa/K^*_0(700)$ resonance, together with large cancellations between isospin channels, produce a large suppression of $\pi^\pm K_S$ femtoscopic correlations compared to widely used models. Within an improved version of the standard on-shell factorization formalism, we illustrate that compensating for this interaction suppression leads to source radii smaller than 1 fm, contrary to usual expectations, as well as larger correlation strengths. The relation between these two parameters cannot be accommodated within naive models describing the nature of the resonances. This may raise concerns about the applicability of popular but too simple approaches for systems with light mesons. However, the correlation-suppression effects we demonstrate here will be relevant in any formalism, and substantial corrections may be expected for other femtoscopic systems involving light mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we proposed the homotopy approach for solving the nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) evolution equation with running QCD coupling. The approach consists of two steps. First, is the analytic solution to the nonlinear evolution equation for the simplified, leading twist kernel. Second, is the iteration procedure that allow us to calculate corrections analytically or semi-numerically. For the leading twist kernel it is shown that the first iteration leads to $\leq 1\%$ accuracy. The $\zeta = -\frac{4N_c}{b_0}Y \ln\Lb \bas (1/Q^2_s(Y))/\bas\Lb r^2\Rb\Rb$ ($r$ is the dipole size, $Q_s$ is the saturation scale) and geometric scaling behaviour of the scattering amplitude are discussed as well as the dependence on the value of the infrared cutoff.</description>

      <title>Chiral extrapolation of the doubly charmed baryons magnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic moments, magnetic form factors, and transition magnetic form factors of doubly charmed baryons are studied within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. We regulate the loop integrals using the finite-range regularization. The contributions of vector mesons are taken into account to investigate the dependence of form factors on the transferred momentum. The finite volume and lattice spacing effects are considered to analyze the lattice QCD simulations which can be understood well in our framework.</description>

      <title>Master integrals for semi-inclusive cuts of massless four-loop propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analytic calculation of all master integrals for 3-, 4-, and 5-particle semi-inclusive cuts of four-loop massless propagators by means of differential equations. We fix the integration constants by reducing the semi-inclusive integrals to their fully inclusive counterparts with the Integration-By-Parts (IBP) method. We validate our results by calculating the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) semi-inclusive $e^+e^- \to X$ cross-section and integrating directly over the differential variable. We provide the results in a machine-readable form. The presented integrals are essential for the direct calculation of NNLO time-like splitting functions and N3LO coefficient functions, which play a crucial role in precision QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Distorting the Top Resonance with Effective Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference effects in effective field theory (EFT) analyses can significantly distort sensitivity expectations, leaving subtle yet distinct signatures in the reconstruction of final states crucial for limit setting around Standard Model predictions. Using the specific example of four-fermion operators in top-quark pair production at the LHC, we provide a detailed quantitative assessment of these resonance distortions. We explore how continuum four-fermion interactions affect the resonance shapes, creating potential tensions between the high-statistics resonance regions and rare, high momentum-transfer continuum excesses. Our findings indicate that although four-fermion interactions do modify the on-shell region comparably to continuum enhancements, current experimental strategies at the High-Luminosity LHC are unlikely to capture these subtle interference-induced distortions. Nonetheless, such effects could become critical for precision analyses at future lepton colliders, such as the FCC-ee. Our work underscores the importance of resonance-shape measurements as complementary probes in global EFT approaches, guiding robust and self-consistent experimental strategies in ongoing and future high-energy physics programmes.</description>

      <title>A natural MSSM from a novel $\mathsf{SO(10)}$, Yukawa unification, light sparticles, and SUSY implications at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ model with a heavy Higgs spectrum consisting of $\mathsf{560+\overline{560}}$ and a light Higgs spectrum consisting of $2\mathsf{\times 10+320}$ plet representations of $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ is unique among $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ models.,It has the remarkable property that VEVs of $\mathsf{560}$ and $\mathsf{\overline{560}}$ can simultaneously reduce the rank of the gauge group and further reduce the remaining symmetry down to the standard model gauge group. Additionally, on mixing with the light fields all the Higgs fields become heavy except for one pair of light Higgs doublets just as in MSSM. This model has not been fully explored thus far because of the technical difficulty of computing the couplings of the heavy and the light Higgs sectors, specifically the interaction $(\mathsf{560\times 560)\cdot 320}$ involving the coupling of tensor-spinors with a third rank ~mixed tensor $\mathsf{320}$. An explicit analysis of such couplings is given in this paper. Spontaneous symmetry breaking of the $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ symmetry is carried out reducing the gauge group to $\mathsf{SU(3)}_c\times \mathsf{SU(2)}_L\times \mathsf{U(1)}_Y$ with just one just pair of light Higgs. Thus a natural deduction of MSSM arises from the $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ model with no fine tuning needed. Further, it is shown that the light Higgs doublet of the model is a linear combination of the Higgs doublet fields of the $2\mathsf{\times 10}$ and the $\mathsf{320}$ Higgs fields. It is shown that in this class of $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ models $b-t-\tau$ unification can be achieved with $\tan\beta$ as low as 5-10. An analysis of the sparticle spectrum within ${\tilde g}$SUGRA renormalization group evolution is given which leads to a bi-modal sparticle spectrum consisting of a compressed low mass spectrum for sleptons and weakinos and a high mass spectrum of gluino, squarks, and heavy Higgs.LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposal developed to exploit the unique scientific potential made possible by the intense hadron beams produced in the far-forward direction at the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Housed in a well-shielded cavern 627 m from the LHC interactions, the facility will enable a broad and deep scientific programme which will greatly extend the physics capability of the HL-LHC. Instrumented with a suite of four complementary detectors -- FLArE, FASER$\nu$2, FASER2 and FORMOSA -- the FPF has unique potential to shed light on neutrino physics, QCD, astroparticle physics, and to search for dark matter and other new particles. This contribution describes some of the key scientific drivers for the facility, the engineering and technical studies that have been made in preparation for it, the design of its four complementary experiments, and the status of the project's partnerships and planning.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witnesses Mediated Via Axion-Like Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is solely a quantum property and it can be extremely helpful to test the physics beyond the Standard Model in tabletop experiments with the advent of future quantum technologies. In this work, we provide an entanglement-based partial positive transpose (PPT) witness for Yukawa-type potentials in the infrared regime between pairs of neutral/charged particles in a spatial quantum superposition. The entanglement is created by the interaction beyond the Standard Model such as Axion-like particle (ALP) or physics motivated by string theory such as extra dimensions in the context of gravity. We will constrain the couplings along with the decoherence rate to show what parameters can be searched for in near future entanglement-driven experiments for the search of new physics.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing hadronically decaying tau leptons with a jet foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The limited availability and accuracy of simulated data has motivated the use of foundation models in high energy physics, with the idea to first train a task-agnostic model on large and potentially unlabeled datasets. This enables the subsequent fine-tuning of the learned representation for specific downstream tasks, potentially requiring much smaller dataset sizes to reach the performance of models trained from scratch. We study how OmniJet-$\alpha$, one of the proposed foundation models for particle jets, can be used on a new set of tasks, and in a new dataset, in order to reconstruct hadronically decaying $\tau$ leptons. We show that the pretraining can successfully be utilized for this multi-task problem, improving the resolution of momentum reconstruction by about 50\% when the pretrained weights are fine-tuned, compared to training the model from scratch. While much work remains ahead to develop generic foundation models for high-energy physics, this early result of generalizing an existing model to a new dataset and to previously unconsidered tasks highlights the importance of testing the approaches on a diverse set of datasets and tasks.</description>

      <title>Solar System Constraints on Light Propagation from Higher Derivative Corrections to General Relativity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. We compare this to the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

Abstract: The sensitivity of the CERN FCC-ee collider to the production of heavy neutral leptons (HNL) is investigated. The study focuses on a simplified model with a single low-mass HNL mixing with a muon, and addresses the fully leptonic and semileptonic decay modes of the HNL. Complete Monte Carlo analyses of signal and background based on a parametrised detector simulation are performed for the FCC-ee run at the $Z$-pole, resulting in an estimate of the intervals of the mixing parameter for which the FCC-ee will have a 95% CL sensitivity as a function of the HNL mass.</description>

Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of a baryon in a top-down holographic QCD. In holographic QCD, the baryons are represented as solitons in a 5-dimensional gauge theory. We obtain the soliton solution by solving the equations of motion numerically. Using this result, the energy-momentum tensor and related quantities such as the mass, mean square radii, and the D-term (druck term) are computed. The evaluated D-term is about $-2.05$, whose absolute value is significantly larger than that in the previous work arXiv:2206.06578.</description>

      <title>Singular instantons with finite action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that in the absence of gravity there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons. In this paper, focusing on the false-vacuum decay in a single scalar field in flat Euclidean space, we provide a general discussion on $O(4)$-symmetric instantons that are singular at the true-vacuum bubble. We find that, for the action to remain finite without introducing a UV cutoff, the potential must be unbounded from below and take the exponential form, thereby evading Coleman's theorem. We then consider two explicit examples of such instantons and perturbatively analyze the dynamics of small deformations around them. We find that one of them does not allow regular deformations, which indicates that the $O(4)$ symmetric solution still gives the minimum action, while the other one is found to allow regular deformations that cost no additional action at second order in perturbation. The latter example opens up the possibility of the existence of non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with lower action if we allow singular instantons with finite action.</description>

      <title>Dip and non-linearity in the curvature perturbation from inflation with a transient non-slow-roll stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider models of inflation that contain a transient non-slow-roll stage and investigate the conditions under which a dip appears in the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we derive a general relation between the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal{R}}$ and the scalar field perturbation $\delta\varphi$ and its velocity perturbation $\delta\pi$. Compared with the result obtained in linear perturbation theory, it turns out that properly taking account of the $\delta\pi$ contribution is essential to reproduce the dip in the power spectrum. Namely, the curvature perturbation is proportional to a specific linear combination of $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\pi$ at the linear order. We also investigate the non-linearity at the dip scale and find that models with a bump or an upward step exhibit much larger non-linearity than ultra-slow-roll and Starobinsky's linear potential models. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of non-linearity by computing the probability density functions (PDFs) for the above-mentioned models and show that highly asymmetric PDFs are realised for models with a bump or a step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing gravitational physics at high school provides educational means for bridging the gap between the image of science held by students and science itself. Natural language is fundamental in this learning. It engages students in constructing an understanding of a concept or a notion, establishing new relations between previous and new elements of knowledge. We present a teaching/learning sequence (TLS) aimed to contextualize gravitational physics along the lines of the Einstein Telescope educational program in Sardinia devoted to upper secondary school students. We focused on the role of debates and controversy in the evolution of science, proposing science-reflexive meta discourses to present physics as a unified knowledge textbook. We discuss our design and present results by analyzing students' semiotic registers to recap their learning during the activity. Finally, we discuss the potentiality of our TLS in orientating students towards STEM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document, written by early career researchers (ECRs) in particle physics, aims to represent the perspectives of the European ECR community and serves as input for the 2025--2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. With input from a community-wide survey, it highlights key challenges faced by ECRs -- career stability, funding access and long-term research opportunities -- while proposing policy recommendations and targeted initiatives. It underscores the importance of practices fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy workplaces, as well as of stronger ECR communities, and highlights how effective communication and interdisciplinary collaborations reinforce the societal relevance of particle physics and promote continued support for large-scale and long-term projects. Finally, the future of both collider and beyond-collider experiments is addressed, emphasising the critical role of ECRs in shaping future projects. The ECR contribution is formed of two parts: the ten-page executive summary submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and, as backup document, this extended white paper providing additional context.</description>

      <title>High $Q^2$ Behavior of the Proton Structure Function through the Balitsky-Kovchegov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous experimental and theoretical investigations have highlighted the power law behavior of the proton structure function $ F_2(x, Q^2) $, particularly the dependence of its power constant on various kinematic variables. In this study, we analyze the proton structure function $ F_2 $ employing the analytical solution of the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, with a focus on the high $ Q^2 $ regime and small $ x $ domains. Our results indicate that as $ Q^2 $ increases, the slope parameter $ \lambda $, which characterizes the growth rate of $ F_2 $, exhibits a gradual decrease, approaching a limiting value of $ \lambda \approx 0.41 \pm 0.01 $ for large $ Q^2 $. We suggest that this behavior of $ \lambda $ may be attributed to mechanisms such as gluon overlap and the suppression of phase space growth. To substantiate these conclusions, further high-precision electron-ion collision experiments are required, encompassing a broad range of $ Q^2 $ and $ x $.</description>

      <title>Production of leptons from decay of heavy-flavor hadrons in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical study on the production of the heavy-flavour decay lepton (HFL) in high-energy nuclear collisions at the LHC. The pp-baseline is calculated by the FONLL program, which matches the next-to-leading order pQCD calculation with the next-to-leading-log large-$p_T$ resummation. The in-medium propagation of heavy quarks is driven by the modified Langevin equations, which consider both the elastic and inelastic partonic interactions. We propose a method to separate the respective influence of the six factors, such as pp-spectra, the cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, in-medium energy loss (E-loss), fragmentation functions (FFs), coalescence (Coal), and decay channels, which may contribute to the larger $R_{AA}$ of HFL $\leftarrow b$ compared to that of HFL $\leftarrow c$ in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Based on quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that both coalescence hadronization, decay channels and the mass-dependent E-loss play an essential role at $p_T&lt;5$ GeV, while the latter dominates the higher $p_T$ region. It is also found that the influences of the CNM effects and FFs are insignificant. At the same time, different initial pp-spectra of charm and bottom quarks have a considerable impact at $p_T&gt;5$ GeV. Furthermore, we explore the path-length dependence of jet quenching by comparing the HFL $R_{AA}$ in two different collision systems. Our investigations show smaller HFL $R_{AA}$ in Pb+Pb than in Xe+Xe within the same centrality bin, consistent with the ALICE data. The longer propagation time and more effective energy loss of heavy quarks in Pb+Pb collisions play critical roles in the stronger yield suppression of the HFL compared to that in Xe+Xe. In addition, we observe a scaling behavior of the HFL $R_{AA}$ in Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Leggett-Garg inequality by means of the neutrino oscillations observed in reactor and accelerator experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the study of the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality in neutrino oscillation data as a mean to test some of the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. In particular, we consider the results of the Daya Bay and RENO reactor experiments, and the MINOS and NOvA accelerator experiments. We find that DB and MINOS exhibit a strong manifestation of Leggett-Garg violation, whereas for RENO and NOvA data, the indication is weaker. Considering the particular baselines and energy ranges explored by each experiment, our results demonstrate that the Leggett-Garg violation is more evident for smaller baseline-to-energy ratios in all the data sets studied, a relevant aspect to consider when looking for evidence of quantum mechanical decoherence in neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Absence of strong CP violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Exploring Baryon Resonances with Transition Generalized Parton Distributions: Status and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QCD gives rise to a rich spectrum of excited baryon states. Understanding their internal structure is important for many areas of nuclear physics, such as nuclear forces, dense matter, and neutrino-nucleus interactions. Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are an established tool for characterizing the QCD structure of the ground-state nucleon. They are used to create 3D tomographic images of the quark/gluon structure and quantify the mechanical properties such as the distribution of mass, angular momentum and forces in the system. Transition GPDs extend these concepts to $N \rightarrow N^\ast$ transitions and can be used to characterize the 3D structure and mechanical properties of baryon resonances. They can be probed in high-momentum-transfer exclusive electroproduction processes with resonance transitions $e + N \rightarrow e' + M + N^\ast$, such as deeply-virtual Compton scattering ($M = \gamma$) or meson production ($M = \pi, K$, $etc.$), and in related photon/hadron-induced processes. This White Paper describes a research program aiming to explore baryon resonance structure with transition GPDs. This includes the properties and interpretation of the transition GPDs, theoretical methods for structures and processes, first experimental results from JLab 12 GeV, future measurements with existing and planned facilities (JLab detector and energy upgrades, COMPASS/AMBER, EIC, EicC, J-PARC, LHC ultraperihperal collisions), and the theoretical and experimental developments needed to realize this program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hierarchy problem is associated with renormalization and decoupling. We can account for the smallness of the scalar mass against loop corrections and its insensitivity to ultraviolet physics through the decoupling of heavy fields. It is essential to correctly identify the observable physical mass as the renormalized one that depends on the external momentum, as opposed to the constant mass. We reconsider the properties of the renormalized loop corrections, which are finite, independent of regularization and admit a well-defined perturbation. By explicit calculation, we show that any loop corrections to the scalar mass-squared are suppressed as $(p^2-m^2)^2/M^2$, where $p,m$ and $M$ are the external momentum, the scalar pole mass and the heavy field mass in the loop, respectively. This is in accordance with the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem, which we have explicitized and completed for the case of the scalar mass.</description>

      <title>Positivity Bounds in Scalar Effective Field Theories at One-loop Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameters in an effective field theory can be subject to certain positivity bounds if one requires a UV completion that obeys the fundamental principles of quantum field theory. These bounds are relatively straightforward at the tree level, but would become more obscure when loop effects are important. Using scalar theories as examples, we carefully exam the positivity bounds in a case where the leading contribution to a forward elastic amplitude arises at the one-loop level, and point out certain subtleties in terms of the implications of positivity bounds on the theory parameter space. In particular, the one-loop generated dimension-8 operator coefficients (that would be positive if generated at the tree level), as well as their $\beta$-functions are generally not subject to positivity bounds as they might correspond to interference terms of the cross sections under the optical theorem, which could have either sign. A strict positivity bound can only be implied when all contributions at the same loop order are considered, including the ones from dim-4 and dim-6 operator coefficients, which have important effects at the one-loop level. Our results may have important implications on the robustness of experimental tests of positivity bounds.</description>

      <title>HEFT approach to investigate the muon g-2 anomaly at a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous work \cite{Buttazzo:2020ibd}, it has been pointed out that heavy new physics (NP) contributions to lepton dipole moments and high-energy cross-sections of lepton pairs into Higgs and $\gamma/Z$ bosons are connected, if the electroweak symmetry breaking is realized linearly. As a consequence, a multi-TeV muon collider would provide a unique test of NP in the muon $g$-2 through the study of high-energy processes such as $\mu^+ \mu^-\to h +\gamma /Z$. Since the analysis involved a SMEFT approach to Higgs-processes, it could also be studied by the more general HEFT formulation. We compute the modification of the high-energy cross-section $\mu^+ \mu^-\to h +\gamma/Z$ and $h\to \mu^{+} \mu^{-} +\gamma /Z$ decay using the dimension six HEFT Lagrangian and compare them with the SMEFT analysis. We find that, within the current HEFT analysis, there are plausible scenarios where the HEFT approach could lead to a higher sensitivity to test the NP contributions in the muon $g$-2. However, a more precise knowledge of the new HEFT parameters is needed for a definite conclusion, which motivates the search for complementary measurements.</description>

      <title>Twist-3 contribution in the Drell-Yan process with tensor-polarized deuteron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tensor-polarized structures of the deuteron can be probed through the proton-deuteron Drell-Yan process, where the proton is unpolarized and the deuteron is tensor polarized. This measurement will be conducted at Fermilab in the near future. In this reaction, the twist-3 contribution is not negligible compared to the twist-2 contribution due to the limited invariant mass of the dilepton pair. We calculate the twist-3 contribution for the Drell-Yan cross section with a tensor-polarized deuteron target, preserving the U(1)-gauge invariance of the hadronic tensor. The cross sections and weighted cross sections are expressed in terms of the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions (PDFs), thus one can extract the PDFs $f_{1\scriptscriptstyle{LL}}$, $f_{\scriptscriptstyle{LT}}$, and $f^{(1)}_{\scriptscriptstyle{1LT}}$ from the experimental measurements of Drell-Yan process. Our study should be helpful to solve the puzzle in the tensor-polarized structures of the deuteron.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter (DM) and quark matter on $f$-mode oscillation of DM admixed quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the prominent non-radial fundamental $f$-mode oscillations of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs), by adopting an equation of state (EoS) developed in Ref.~\cite{Sen:2022pfr}, which considers the possible presence of feebly interacting DM in strange quark stars (SQSs) for the first time. Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness and $\ln{\Lambda}$ for DMSQSs. Further, our studies indicate that the inclusion of DM in compact stars reduces the deviation of $f$-mode frequency from general relativistic to Cowling approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we discuss a novel method to search for inhomogeneous chiral symmetry breaking in theories with fermions. The prime application we have in mind is QCD, but the method is also applicable for other theories, including solid-state applications. It is based on an extension of the chiral susceptibility to inhomogeneous phases and it works as a stability analysis. Our method allows us to determine when homogeneous solutions have the tendency to create spatially modulated condensates. As proof of principle, we apply this technique to a rainbow-ladder QCD model and find that its phase diagram contains an inhomogeneous region.</description>

      <title>Using $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ to constrain preferred axion model dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preferred axion models are minimal realizations of the Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP problem while providing a dark matter candidate. These models invoke new heavy quarks that interact strongly with the Standard Model bringing them into thermal equilibrium in the early Universe. We show that for a number of these models, the heavy quarks will decay after axions have decoupled from the Standard Model thermal bath. As a consequence, any axion products in the decay form a component of dark radiation. This provides the potential to differentiate between preferred axion models through measurements of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom. The most sensitive of which comes from the Planck collaboration's measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background. We find that existing constraints allow us to rule out regions of parameter space for 40% of the canonical preferred axion models.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the mass spectrum of the hidden-charm hybrid states with the $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, $0^{++}$, $0^{--}$, $1^{++}$, $1^{+-}$, $1^{-+}$, $1^{--}$, $2^{-+}$ and $2^{++}$ via the QCD sum rules in a consistent way. We calculate the vacuum condensates up to dimensions-6 by taking account of both the leading order and next-to-leading order contributions, and take the energy scale formula $\mu=\sqrt{M^2_{X/Y/Z}-(2{\mathbb{M}}_c)^2}$ to choose the suitable energy scales of the QCD spectral densities, it is the first time to explore the energy scale dependence of the QCD sum rules for the hidden-charm hybrid states.</description>

      <title>PDFxTMDLib and QtPDFxTMDPlotter: A High-Performance Framework and Plotting Tool for Transverse and Collinear Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PDFxTMD, a high-performance C++ library that provides unified access to both collinear parton distribution functions (cPDFs) and transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). The library employs modern C++ design patterns, including the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) and type erasure, to achieve optimal computational efficiency while maintaining extensibility. Performance benchmarks demonstrate that PDFxTMD offers better performance improvements over existing libraries for both TMD and collinear distribution calculations. The library provides clearly defined interfaces for reading grid files, interpolation, and extrapolation, enabling straightforward implementation of custom components for specialized requirements. While maintaining compatibility with standard LHAPDF and TMDLib file formats, PDFxTMD's architecture also accommodates non-standard formats through user-defined readers. We also introduce QtPDFxTMDPlotter, a companion visualization tool with an intuitive graphical interface for researchers to select PDF sets, interactively examine distribution properties across various kinematic ranges, and export to different file formats. Together, these tools provide the high-energy physics community with an efficient, flexible solution for PDF computations in theoretical and phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Minimal dark matter in $SU(5)$ grand unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal dark matter is an attractive candidate for dark matter because it is stabilized without the need to impose additional symmetries. It is known that the $SU(2)_L$ quintuplet fermion can serve as a minimal dark matter candidate, with its mass predicted to be around $14~\mathrm{TeV}$, based on the thermal production mechanism. In this work, we embed the quintuplet dark matter within nonsupersymmetric $SU(5)$ grand unified theories. We find that two pairs of colored sextet fermions are required at the $\mathcal{O}(1-10)~\mathrm{TeV}$ scale to achieve gauge coupling unification, with the unification scale near the reduced Planck scale. These colored sextet fermions become metastable because their interactions are suppressed by the unification scale. Our model can be tested through comprehensive searches for colored sextet fermions in collider experiments, as well as through indirect and direct detection methods for minimal dark matter. Once the minimal dark matter scenario has been experimentally confirmed, it will have implications for modifying string theories.</description>

      <title>Di-decay signature of new physics particles at intensity frontier experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a strategy to search for unstable feebly interacting particles (FIPs) at intensity frontier experiments by leveraging ``di-decay'' events, in which two FIPs are produced simultaneously, and each decays inside the detector. Compared to standard single-decay searches, di-decays yield cleaner signals, allow reconstructing the mother particle producing the FIPs, and offer deeper insight into the FIP couplings to Standard Model particles. As a concrete illustration, we focus on Higgs-like scalars that couple quadratically to the Higgs boson, deriving sensitivity projections at SHiP, Belle~II, and the Downstream algorithm at LHCb. In particular, at Belle II, non-negligible backgrounds for single-decay searches make di-decays highly competitive, providing a distinctive handle on the production and lifetime of these scalars. Our findings will potentially affect the search program of these experiments.</description>

      <title>A common origin of two accelerating universes: inflation and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quantum theory of inflaton and its decay product of various gauge boson pairs to investigate the preheating towards thermalized universe. The inflaton decay into gauge-boson pairs is shown to be inevitably accompanied by tachyon-mass-like correction to inflation potential that ultimately leads to an inflaton escape out of trapped local potential minimum towards the field infinity. This gives rise to a conversion mechanism of early inflationary acceleration to a quintessence dark energy acceleration at late stages of cosmic evolution. The success of the escape depends on how standard particles are incorporated into a scheme of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. New types of super-radiance mechanism that enhance the ending of preheating are identified and compared with the Dicke model.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Sensors for Ultraheavy Dark Matter Searches via Long-range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $\sim 80\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and Collider Phenomenology in Radiative Type-III Seesaw Model with Two Inert Doublets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal Type-III scotogenic model featuring two inert scalar doublets and a hyperchargeless triplet fermion. The scalar sector, in addition to the Standard Model Higgs, includes a rich spectrum of dark scalars comprising two CP-even, two CP-odd, and two charged states. This framework gives rise to two viable dark matter candidates: the lightest CP-even dark scalar and the neutral component of the triplet fermion. We perform a comprehensive analysis of both dark matter scenarios, carefully examining their viability under the umbrella of theoretical consistency conditions and experimental constraints. Beyond the conventional collider signatures anticipated in the Type-III scotogenic model with a single inert doublet, our extended framework predicts distinctive and novel signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonplanar universal anomalous dimension of twist-two operators at four loops in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and push its direct diagrammatic calculation through Lorentz spin j=20, one unit beyond the state of the art, so as to confirm the correctness of the general, all-j result conjectured previously by us [1] imposing certain constraints on its analytic form. Thanks to our new result, such constraints can be eliminated altogether. By the same token, this allows us to re-derive, in a completely independent way, the nonplanar four-loop cusp anomalous dimension by taking the large-j limit of the general result.</description>

      <title>Picolensing as a Probe of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational-lensing parallax of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an intriguing probe of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter in the asteroid-mass window, $2\times 10^{-16}M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\text{PBH}} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$. Recent work in the literature has shown exciting potential reach for this "picolensing" signal if a future space mission were to fly two x-/$\gamma$-ray detectors in the Swift/BAT class, with inter-spacecraft separation baselines on the order of the Earth-Moon distance. We revisit these projections with a view to understanding their robustness to various uncertainties related to GRBs. Most importantly, we investigate the impact of uncertainties in observed GRB angular sizes on reach projections for a future mission. Overall, we confirm that picolensing shows great promise to explore the asteroid-mass window; however, we find that previous studies may have been too optimistic with regard to the baselines required. Detector baselines on the order of at least the Earth-L2 distance would make such a mission more robust to GRB size uncertainties; baselines on the order of an astronomical unit (AU) would additionally enable reach that equals or exceeds existing microlensing constraints up to $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 2 \times 10^{-8} M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>A note on loop resummation in de Sitter spacetime with the wavefunction of the universe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the computation of $n$-point correlation functions in de Sitter spacetime, including loop corrections, using the wavefunction of the universe approach. This method consists of two stages employing distinct Feynman rules. First, one must compute the wavefunction coefficients using interactions as vertices. Then, in the second stage, one computes correlation functions using wavefunction coefficients as vertices. For massless fields, loop corrections in the first stage are free of infrared (IR) divergences, which leads to the question of how this matches the well-known IR behavior of correlators obtained via other methods. By considering a scalar field with an arbitrary potential, we compute $n$-point correlation functions to first order in the potential but to all orders in loops. We find that, although loop integrals in the first stage are indeed IR convergent, the second procedure reintroduces the IR divergence. We discuss how this induces renormalization of the interaction potential such that the final result combining both steps exactly matches the form of $n$-point functions previously calculated with other methods.</description>

      <title>An Open Effective Field Theory for light in a medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many scenarios of interest, a quantum system interacts with an unknown environment, necessitating the use of open quantum system methods to capture dissipative effects and environmental noise. With the long-term goal of developing a perturbative theory for open quantum gravity, we take an important step by studying Abelian gauge theories within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We begin with a pedagogical review of general results for open free theories, setting the stage for our primary focus: constructing the most general open effective field theory for electromagnetism in a medium. We assume locality in time and space, but allow for an arbitrary finite number of derivatives. Crucially, we demonstrate that the two copies of the gauge group associated with the two branches of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour are not broken but are instead deformed by dissipative effects. We provide a thorough discussion of gauge fixing, define covariant gauges, and calculate the photon propagators, proving that they yield gauge-invariant results. A notable result is the discovery that gauge invariance is accompanied by non-trivial constraints on noise fluctuations. We derive these constraints through three independent methods, highlighting their fundamental significance for the consistent formulation of open quantum gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium, we find that dark matter energy input raises planetary temperature and accelerates rotation. The energy distribution depends on planetary properties and external input, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated its heating effect. When dark matter density is high, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and is primarily governed by dark matter. For Earth, our model predicts a 0.015 K temperature increase and a $10^{-8}$ rad/s angular velocity increase over 100 years.</description>
