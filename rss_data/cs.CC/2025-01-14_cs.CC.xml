      <title>Determining distances and consensus between mutation trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutational heterogeneity of tumours can be described with a tree representing the evolutionary history of the tumour. With noisy sequencing data there may be uncertainty in the inferred tree structure, while we may also wish to study patterns in the evolution of cancers in different patients. In such situations, understanding tree similarities is a key challenge, and therefore we present an approach to determine distances between trees. Considering the bounded height of trees, we determine the distances associated with the swap operations over strings. While in general, by solving the {\sc Maximum Common Almost $v$-tree} problem between two trees, we describe an efficient approach to determine the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. The inherent noise in current statistical methods for constructing mutation evolution trees of cancer cells presents a significant challenge: handling such collections of trees to determine a consensus tree that accurately represents the set and evaluating the extent of their variability or dispersion. Given a set of mutation trees and the notion of distance, there are at least two natural ways to define the ``target'' tree, such as a min-sum (\emph{median tree}) or a min-max (\emph{closest tree}) of a set of trees. Thus, considering a set of trees as input and dealing with the {\sc median} and {\sc closest} problems, we prove that both problems are \NP-complete, even with only three input trees. In addition, we develop algorithms to obtain upper bounds on the median and closest solutions, which are analysed by the experiments presented on generated and on real databases. We show a fast way to find consensus trees with better results than any tree in the input set while still preserving all internal structure.</description>

      <title>Strong Low Degree Hardness for Stable Local Optima in Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a folklore belief in the theory of spin glasses and disordered systems that out-of-equilibrium dynamics fail to find stable local optima exhibiting e.g. local strict convexity on physical time-scales. In the context of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick spin glass, Behrens-Arpino-Kivva-Zdeborov\'a and Minzer-Sah-Sawhney have recently conjectured that this obstruction may be inherent to all efficient algorithms, despite the existence of exponentially many such optima throughout the landscape. We prove this search problem exhibits strong low degree hardness for polynomial algorithms of degree $D\leq o(N)$: any such algorithm has probability $o(1)$ to output a stable local optimum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to prove that even constant-degree polynomials have probability $o(1)$ to solve a random search problem without planted structure. To prove this, we develop a general-purpose enhancement of the ensemble overlap gap property, and as a byproduct improve previous results on spin glass optimization, maximum independent set, random $k$-SAT, and the Ising perceptron to strong low degree hardness. Finally for spherical spin glasses with no external field, we prove that Langevin dynamics does not find stable local optima within dimension-free time.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Capability of Graph Neural Networks: A Circuit Complexity Bound Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the standard approach for learning and reasoning over relational data, leveraging the message-passing mechanism that iteratively propagates node embeddings through graph structures. While GNNs have achieved significant empirical success, their theoretical limitations remain an active area of research. Existing studies primarily focus on characterizing GNN expressiveness through Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism tests. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach by exploring the computational limitations of GNNs through the lens of circuit complexity. Specifically, we analyze the circuit complexity of common GNN architectures and prove that under constraints of constant-depth layers, linear or sublinear embedding sizes, and polynomial precision, GNNs cannot solve key problems such as graph connectivity and graph isomorphism unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$. These results reveal the intrinsic expressivity limitations of GNNs behind their empirical success and introduce a novel framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness that can be extended to a broader range of GNN models and graph decision problems.</description>

      <title>Stable Set Polytopes with Rank $|V(G)|/3$ for the Lov{\'a}sz--Schrijver SDP Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytope of graphs with respect to the Lov{\'a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$ applied to the fractional stable set polytope. In particular, we show that for every positive integer $\ell$, the smallest possible graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ contains $3\ell$ vertices. This result is sharp and settles a conjecture posed by Lipt{\'a}k and the second author in 2003, as well as answers a generalization of a problem posed by Knuth in 1994. We also show that for every positive integer $\ell$ there exists a vertex-transitive graph on $4\ell+12$ vertices with $\text{LS}_+$-rank at least $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable routing in data center networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid network is a static (electronic) network that is augmented with optical switches. The Reconfigurable Routing Problem (RRP) in hybrid networks is the problem of finding settings for the optical switches augmenting a static network so as to achieve optimal delivery of some given workload. The problem has previously been studied in various scenarios with both tractability and NP-hardness results obtained. However, the data center and interconnection networks to which the problem is most relevant are almost always such that the static network is highly structured (and often node-symmetric) whereas all previous results assume that the static network can be arbitrary (which makes existing computational hardness results less technologically relevant and also easier to obtain). In this paper, and for the first time, we prove various intractability results for RRP where the underlying static network is highly structured, for example consisting of a hypercube, and also extend some existing tractability results.</description>

      <title>Toward Better Depth Lower Bounds: Strong Composition of XOR and a Random Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proving formula depth lower bounds is a fundamental challenge in complexity theory, with the strongest known bound of $(3 - o(1))\log n$ established by Hastad over 25 years ago. The Karchmer-Raz-Wigderson (KRW) conjecture offers a promising approach to advance these bounds and separate P from NC$^{1}$. It suggests that the depth complexity of a function composition $f \diamond g$ approximates the sum of the depth complexities of $f$ and $g$.
  The Karchmer-Wigderson (KW) relation framework translates formula depth into communication complexity, restating the KRW conjecture as $\mathsf{CC}(\mathsf{KW}_f \diamond \mathsf{KW}_g) \approx \mathsf{CC}(\mathsf{KW}_f) + \mathsf{CC}(\mathsf{KW}_g)$. Prior work has confirmed the conjecture under various relaxations, often replacing one or both KW relations with the universal relation or constraining the communication game through strong composition.
  In this paper, we examine the strong composition $\mathsf{KW}_{\mathsf{XOR}} \circledast \mathsf{KW}_f$ of the parity function and a random Boolean function $f$. We prove that with probability $1-o(1)$, any protocol solving this composition requires at least $n^{3 - o(1)}$ leaves. This result establishes a depth lower bound of $(3 - o(1))\log n$, matching Hastad's bound, but is applicable to a broader class of inner functions, even when the outer function is simple. Though bounds for the strong composition do not translate directly to formula depth bounds, they usually help to analyze the standard composition (of the corresponding two functions) which is directly related to formula depth.</description>

      <title>Accelerating genetic optimization of nonlinear model predictive control by learning optimal search space size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genetic algorithm (GA) is typically used to solve nonlinear model predictive control's optimization problem. However, the size of the search space in which the GA searches for the optimal control inputs is crucial for its applicability to fast-response systems. This paper proposes accelerating the genetic optimization of NMPC by learning optimal search space size. The approach trains a multivariate regression model to adaptively predict the best smallest size of the search space in every control cycle. The proposed approach reduces the GA's computational time, improves the chance of convergence to better control inputs, and provides a stable and feasible solution. The proposed approach was evaluated on three nonlinear systems and compared to four other evolutionary algorithms implemented in a processor-in-the-loop fashion. The results show that the proposed approach provides a 17-45\% reduction in computational time and increases the convergence rate by 35-47\%. The source code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>High Rate Multivariate Polynomial Evaluation Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Reed-Muller codes over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ are based on evaluations of $m$-variate polynomials of degree at most $d$ over a product set $U^m$, for some $d$ less than $|U|$. Because of their good distance properties, as well as the ubiquity and expressive power of polynomials, these codes have played an influential role in coding theory and complexity theory. This is especially so in the setting of $U$ being ${\mathbb{F}}_q$ where they possess deep locality properties. However, these Reed-Muller codes have a significant limitation in terms of the rate achievable -- the rate cannot be more than $\frac{1}{m{!}} = \exp(-m \log m)$.
  In this work, we give the first constructions of multivariate polynomial evaluation codes which overcome the rate limitation -- concretely, we give explicit evaluation domains $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^m$ on which evaluating $m$-variate polynomials of degree at most $d$ gives a good code. For $m= O(1)$, these new codes have relative distance $\Omega(1)$ and rate $1 - \epsilon$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. In fact, we give two quite different constructions, and for both we develop efficient decoding algorithms for these codes that can decode from half the minimum distance.
  The first of these codes is based on evaluating multivariate polynomials on simplex-like sets whereas the second construction is more algebraic, and surprisingly (to us), has some strong locality properties, specifically, we show that they are locally testable.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Envy-free and Exchange-stable Seat Arrangement Problems on Grid Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Seat Arrangement Problem is a problem of finding a desirable seat arrangement for given preferences of agents and a seat graph that represents a configuration of seats. In this paper, we consider decision problems of determining if an envy-free arrangement exists and an exchange-stable arrangement exists, when a seat graph is an $\ell \times m$ grid graph. When $\ell=1$, the seat graph is a path of length $m$ and both problems have been known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we extend it and show that both problems are NP-complete for any integer $\ell \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Fast Matrix Multiplication meets the Submodular Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One fundamental question in database theory is the following: Given a Boolean conjunctive query Q, what is the best complexity for computing the answer to Q in terms of the input database size N? When restricted to the class of combinatorial algorithms, it is known that the best known complexity for any query Q is captured by the submodular width of Q. However, beyond combinatorial algorithms, certain queries are known to admit faster algorithms that often involve a clever combination of fast matrix multiplication and data partitioning. Nevertheless, there is no systematic way to derive and analyze the complexity of such algorithms for arbitrary queries Q.
  In this work, we introduce a general framework that captures the best complexity for answering any Boolean conjunctive query Q using matrix multiplication. Our framework unifies both combinatorial and non-combinatorial techniques under the umbrella of information theory. It generalizes the notion of submodular width to a new stronger notion called the omega-submodular width that naturally incorporates the power of fast matrix multiplication. We describe a matching algorithm that computes the answer to any query Q in time corresponding to the omega-submodular width of Q. We show that our framework recovers the best known complexities for Boolean queries that have been studied in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, and also discovers new algorithms for some classes of queries that improve upon the best known complexities.</description>
