      <title>The impact of a measurement on an open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A molecular MCB junction in the partially wet phase has been used to probe effects related to open quantum systems. Although the exact quantum system, environment, and coupling, are not known the nature of the experiments shows a measurement influenced next measurement. The quantum system senses the measurement outcome and prepares itself in a state other than the state related to the measurement outcome. This triggers an alternation of measurements which are indicative of two current carrying states. In case three or more current carrying states are observed, there exists a fixed sequence of states that carry the current. We conclude that memory effects in these systems are responsible for these experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Designing Flat Bands and Pseudo-Landau Levels in GaAs with Patterned Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a periodic patterned gate. By incorporating the superlattice potential (SL) induced by patterning into the Schrodinger equation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions. These solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram illustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by the SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard plane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL strength increases. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree screening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic interactions. Our findings not only reveal a competition between SL strength and electron-electron interactions, leading to a reduction in the effective potential, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for understanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.</description>

      <title>Weyl Geometry in Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel oscillatory behaviour of the DC conductivity in Weyl semimetals with vacancies has recently been identified, occurring in the absence of external magnetic fields. Here, we argue that this effect has a geometric interpretation in terms of a magnetic-like field induced by an emergent Weyl connection. This geometric gauge field is related to the non-metricity of the underlying effective geometry, which is physically induced by vacancies in the lattice system. Finally, we postulate that the chiral magnetic effect in Weyl semimetals can be affected by the presence of dynamical vacancies.</description>

      <title>Quantum-hydrodynamic modal perspective on plasmonic gap structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic gap structures are among the few configurations capable of generating extreme light confinement, finding applications in surface-enhanced spectroscopy, ultrasensitive detection, photocatalysis and more. Their plasmonic response undergoes a dramatic, quantum effect-driven transition as the gap size approaches zero. Modal analysis can reveal insights into the mechanisms governing this process, which are otherwise obscured by nonlocal damping effects. Here, we offer a fresh modal perspective on the transition of the plasmonic response using quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT)-based quasinormal mode (QNM) analysis. Focusing on the bonding dipolar and charge-transfer plasmons of a nanosphere dimer, we examine the detailed mode transition through the touching regime as well as the asymptotic behavior compared with the classical results as the constituent nanoparticles either separate or overlap. The complex eigenfrequency particularly provides accurate information on the linewidth and quality factor of the plasmon modes. We introduce an index to characterize charge-transfer efficiency, especially for the charge-transfer plasmon. The significant role of nonlocal damping in the mode evolution is elucidated by our mode-resolved QHT-QNM analysis. The insights from our theoretical study provide an integrated understanding of mode evolution in plasmonic gap structures, which can further advance gap structure-based applications.</description>

      <title>Bias Voltage Driven Tunneling Magnetoresistance Polarity Reversal in 2D Stripy Antiferromagnet CrOCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin materials with coupled magnetic and electric polarization are critical for developing energy-efficient and high-density spintronic devices, yet they remain scarce due to often conflicting requirements of stabilizing both magnetic and electric orders. The recent discovery of the magnetoelectric effect in the 2D stripy antiferromagnet CrOCl highlights this semiconductor as a promising platform to explore electric field effects on magnetoresistance. In this study, we systematically investigate the magnetoresistance in tunneling junctions of bilayer and monolayer CrOCl. We observe that the transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic phases in both cases induces a positive magnetoresistance at low bias voltages, which reverses to a negative value at higher bias voltages. This polarity reversal is attributed to the additional electric dipoles present in the antiferromagnetic state, as supported by our theoretical calculations. These findings suggest a pathway for the electric control of spintronic devices and underscore the potential of 2D magnets like CrOCl in advancing energy-efficient spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Automated in situ optimization and disorder mitigation in a quantum device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate automated in situ optimization of the potential landscape in a quantum point contact device, using a $3 \times 3$ gate array patterned atop the constriction. Optimization is performed using the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy, for which we introduce a metric for how "step-like" the conductance is as the channel becomes constricted. We first perform the optimization of the gate voltages in a tight-binding simulation and show how such in situ tuning can be used to mitigate a random disorder potential. The optimization is then performed in a physical device in experiment, where we also observe a marked improvement in the quantization of the conductance resulting from the optimization procedure.</description>

      <title>Baseband control of single-electron silicon spin qubits in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micromagnet-enabled electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR) is an established method of high-fidelity single-spin control in silicon. However, the resulting architectural limitations have restrained silicon quantum processors to one-dimensional arrays, and heating effects from the associated microwave dissipation exacerbates crosstalk during multi-qubit operations. In contrast, qubit control based on hopping spins has recently emerged as a compelling primitive for high-fidelity baseband control in sparse two-dimensional hole arrays in germanium. In this work, we commission a $^{28}$Si/SiGe 2x2 quantum dot array both as a four-qubit device with pairwise exchange interactions using established EDSR techniques and as a two-qubit device using baseband hopping control. In this manner, we can evaluate the two modes of operation in terms of fidelity, coherence, and crosstalk. We establish a lower bound on the fidelity of the hopping gate of 99.50(6)%, which is similar to the average fidelity of the resonant gate of 99.54(4)%. Lowering the external field to reach the hopping regime nearly doubles the measured $T_2^{\mathrm{H}}$, suggesting a reduced coupling to charge noise. Finally, the hopping gate circumvents the transient pulse-induced resonance shift. To further motivate the hopping gate approach as an attractive means of scaling silicon spin-qubit arrays, we propose an extensible nanomagnet design that enables engineered baseband control of large spin arrays.</description>

      <title>Artificial topological insulator realized in a two-terminal Josephson junction with Rashba spin-orbit interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-terminal Josephson junction with conventional superconductors and a normal region with Rashba spin-orbit interaction, characterized by two Aharonov-Casher (AC) fluxes. When the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$, the Andreev subgap spectrum may host zero-energy Weyl singularities associated with a vanishing normal-state reflection eigenvalue. With one of the AC fluxes playing the role of a quasimomentum, the junction can be viewed as an artificial one-dimensional chiral topological insulator. Its topological phase can be tuned by crossing a Weyl singularity by means of varying the remaining AC flux. By associating an additional component of the quasimomentum with the superconducting phase difference, an artificial Chern insulator is realized.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Transport in Non-centrosymmetric Systems: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ohm's law has been a cornerstone of electronics since its experimental discovery. This law establishes that in a conductive system, the voltage is directly proportional to the current. Even when time-reversal symmetry is disrupted, leading to the emergence of magnetoresistance and Hall effects, the linear relationship between voltage and current remains intact. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a breakdown of Ohm's law in non-centrosymmetric structures. In these systems, non-linear transport effects are permitted with quadratic scaling between voltages and currents. Here, we review the main demonstrations of non-linear transport in non-centrosymmetric systems, analyzing the connection between non-linear behavior and the system's symmetry. Additionally, we delve into the microscopic mechanisms driving these effects, such as Berry curvature dipole and Berry connection polarizability. Finally, we highlight potential applications of non-linear transport in spintronics and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>The SYK charging advantage as a random walk on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charging dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models as quantum batteries, highlighting their capacity to achieve quantum charging advantages. By analytically deriving the scaling of the charging power in SYK batteries, we identify the two key mechanisms underlying this advantage: the use of operators scaling extensively with system size $N$ and the facilitation of operator delocalization by specific graph structures. A novel graph-theoretic framework is introduced in which the charging process is recast as a random walk on a graph, enabling a quantitative analysis of operator spreading. Our results establish rigorous conditions for the quantum advantage in SYK batteries and extend these insights to graph-based SYK models, revealing broader implications for energy storage and quantum dynamics. This work opens avenues for leveraging quantum chaos and complex network structures in optimizing energy transfer processes.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stability and Topological Charge Fragmentation in Antiskyrmions of Rhombohedral Barium Titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiskyrmions, as topological quasi-particles, hold significant promise for spintronics and nanoscale data storage applications. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the thermal stability of antiskyrmion nanodomains in rhombohedral barium titanate. At 1 K, antiskyrmions with a topological charge of -2 emerge as the most stable nanodomain state across all examined diameters. In our systematic study, the most robust antiskyrmion was found to have a diameter of 4 nm, maintaining its original size, shape, and topological charge up to the characteristic temperature T* ~ 85 K. Domains with diameters between 2.8 and approximately 4.5 nm exhibit fragmentation into six topological defects, termed quarks, each carrying a fractional skyrmion charge of -1/3. For domains larger than 4.5 nm, each topological quark splits into two pre-quarks, each with a charge of -1/6. These larger nanodomains demonstrate increased mobility and a growing tendency for shape and skyrmion charge fluctuations. Above the T* temperature, all larger nanodomains gradually shrink to a diameter of about 4 nm before collapsing into a single-domain state. These findings reveal the relatively high stability of antiskyrmions over a broad temperature range, even in the absence of a stabilizing bias field, and emphasize the pivotal role of topological quark dynamics. This establishes barium titanate as a key platform for exploring and applying topological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Angstrom Scale Ionic Memristors' Engineering with van der Waals Materials- A Route to Highly Tunable Memory States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristors that mimic brain functions are crucial for energy-efficient neuromorphic devices. Ion channels that emulate biological synapses are still in the early stages of development, especially the tunability of memory states. Here, we demonstrate that cations such as K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Al3+ intercalated in the interlayer spaces of vermiculite, result in highly confined channels of size 3-5 {\AA}. They host exotic memristor properties through ion exchange dynamics, even at high salt concentrations of 1 M. The bipolar memristor characteristics observed are tunable with frequency, geometric asymmetry, ion concentration, and intercalants. Notably, we observe polarization-flipping memristor behavior in two cases: one with Al3+ ions and another with devices having a geometric asymmetry ratio greater than 15. This inversion is attributed to the over-screening of counter-ions due to their accumulation at the channel entrance. Our results suggest that ion exchange dynamics, ion-ion interactions, and ion accumulation/depletion mechanisms, particularly with multivalent ions, can be harnessed to develop advanced memristor devices.</description>

      <title>Surface-plasmon polaritons in multilayer jellium systems: dispersion and spatial description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic waves that propagate along metal-dielectric interfaces, with important applications in sensing, energy, and nanotechnology. While the behavior of SPPs in single metal slabs is well understood, the coupling between plasmon modes in multilayer systems has received less attention. In this paper, we explore the response functions of SPPs in single-slab, double-slab, and two-different-slab systems using the jellium model. Thanks to a comparison with classical models, our study reveals how quantum effects influence the resonance frequencies of these modes. It also details the spatial description of the different SPP modes and unveils how their coupling occurs in two-different-slab systems. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of SPPs, especially in complex nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory magnetic field-dependent critical temperatures of ultraclean Type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of the Zeeman energy and the Landau levels (LLs) arising from an applied magnetic field ${\bf B}$ upon the critical temperature $T_c$ is studied using a fully quantum mechanical method within the framework of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity that forms from an ultraclean metal. As in semiclassical treatments, we found that two electrons can form Cooper pairs with opposite spins and momenta in the ${\bf B}$ direction while either in the same or in neighboring LLs. However, the fully quantum mechanical treatment of the LLs causes $T_c({\bf B})$ for electrons paired on the same LL to oscillate about the critical temperature of the BCS theory, similar to that of the de Haas-van Alphen effect. The Zeeman energy causes $T_c({\bf B})$ to decrease in an oscillatory fashion with increasing ${\bf B}$ for electrons paired either on the same or on neighboring LLs. For the Zeeman $g &gt; 1$, pairing on neighboring LLs results in the highest $T_c({\bf B})$. For $g &lt; 1$, pairing on the same LLs gives the highest $T_c({\bf B})$. In addition, $T_c({\bf B})$ for electrons paired on neighboring LLs exhibits an apparent symmetry around $g=2$, as the oscillatory critical temperature behaviors are nearly identical for $g=2\pm\delta$.</description>

      <title>Corrugation-dominated mechanical softening of defect-engineered graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\text{2D}$ of atomically clean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density in correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (&lt; 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering</description>

      <title>Finite-frequency noise, Fano factor, $\Delta T$-noise and cross-correlations in double quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical study on electrical current fluctuations in a double quantum dot connected to electronic reservoirs is presented, with the aim of deriving the finite-frequency noise, the Fano factor and the $\Delta T$-noise. We establish a general expression for the noise in terms of Green functions in the double quantum dot and self-energies in the reservoirs. This result is then applied to model double quantum dots in various situations. For a non-interacting double quantum dot, we highlight several interesting features in the physical properties of this system. In particular, we demonstrate the possibility of obtaining a significant reduction in zero-frequency noise and Fano factor either when the system is placed in a given operating regime, or when a temperature gradient is applied between the two reservoirs, resulting in a negative $\Delta T$-noise being generated. In addition, in the vicinity of honeycomb vertices, a sign change is observed in the finite-frequency cross-correlator between the two reservoirs, in contrast to what is obtained for the zero-frequency cross-correlator, which remains negative throughout the $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-plane, $\varepsilon_{1,2}$ being the level energies in each of the two dots. By using an approximate first-level numerical approach, we finally study how the finite-frequency noise in a double quantum dot evolves under the influence of Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Tunable ultrastrong magnon magnon coupling and spin Hall magnetoresistance in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) magnons and the manipulation of magnetisation via spin currents in van der Waals (vdW) materials offer substantial potential for applications in magnonics and spintronics. In this study, we demonstrate ultrastrong magnon-magnon coupling in the GHz regime within a vdW AFM, achieving a remarkable maximum normalised coupling strength of 0.47. Our investigation unveils the tunability of coupling strength through temperature-dependent magnetic anisotropies. Additionally, we show the prospect for further enhancement to the deep-strong magnon-magnon coupling regime by manipulating the anisotropy. Furthermore, we report spin Hall magnetoresistance in a vdW AFM-based device and study the field and temperature dependence. These findings highlight the transformative potential of vdW AFMs in advancing the field of spin-based technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15553v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom, multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of semiclassical and response theories for second-order nonlinear ac Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known that the semiclassical theory and the response theory can equivalently give the Drude and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivities in the linear order of electric field. However, recent theoretical advances implied that the second-order nonlinear conductivities calculated with both approaches are no longer equivalent, which leads to various experimental explanations even in a similar experimental setup conducted in \href{https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf1506}{[\textit{Science \textbf{381}, 181 (2023)}]} and \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06363-3}{[\textit{Nature \textbf{621}, 487 (2023)}]}, respectively. Herein, by extending the AC semiclassical theory up to the second order of electric field, we show that the semiclassical theory is still equivalent to the response theory in the second order of electric field when the relaxation is taken into account on the same footing. In particular, we show that the familiar second-order nonlinear current responses, including the nonlinear Drude current and the Berry curvature (quantum metric) dipole driven extrinsic (intrinsic) nonlinear Hall current, can be derived by both approaches. Further, we show that the quantum-corrected intrinsic nonlinear longitudinal current, as recently proposed by the response theory or in a similar manner, can also be reproduced by the semiclassical theory. Beyond those known second-order current responses, with both approaches, we uncover two previously overlooked nonlinear displacement currents unique to the AC electric field. As a consequence of this equivalence,...</description>

      <title>Topological orbital Hall effect caused by skyrmions and antiferromagnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions and antiferromagnetic bimerons that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity. Skyrmionic textures serve as generators of orbital currents that can transport information and give rise to considerable orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's demon across the quantum-to-classical transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scenarios coined Maxwell's demon, information on microscopic degrees of freedom is used to seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. This has been studied in the classical as well as the quantum domain. In this paper, we study an implementation of Maxwell's demon that can operate in both domains. In particular, we investigate information-to-work conversion over the quantum-to-classical transition. The demon continuously measures the charge state of a double quantum dot, and uses this information to guide electrons against a voltage bias by tuning the on-site energies of the dots. Coherent tunneling between the dots allows for the buildup of quantum coherence in the system. Under strong measurements, the coherence is suppressed, and the system is well-described by a classical model. As the measurement strength is further increased, the Zeno effect prohibits interdot tunneling. A Zeno-like effect is also observed for weak measurements, where measurement errors lead to fluctuations in the on-site energies, dephasing the system. We anticipate similar behaviors in other quantum systems under continuous measurement and feedback control, making our results relevant for implementations in quantum technology and quantum control.</description>

Abstract: Nonpolar atoms or molecules with low particle mass and weak inter-particle interactions can form quantum liquids and solids (QLS) at low temperatures. Excess electrons naturally bind to the surfaces of QLS in a vacuum, exhibiting unique quantum electronic behaviors in two and lower dimensions. This article reviews the historical development and recent progress in this field. Key topics include collective and individual electron transport on liquid helium, solid neon, and solid hydrogen; theoretical proposals and experimental efforts toward single-electron qubits on superfluid helium; the recent experimental realization of single-electron charge qubits on solid neon; and related theoretical calculations. Finally, we discuss and envision future exploration of quantum electronics in heterogeneous QLS systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quasiparticle Relaxation in a Superconductor via the Proximity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle relaxation in pure superconductors is thought to be determined by the intrinsic inelastic scattering rate in the material. In certain applications, i.e. superconducting qubits and circuits, excess quasiparticles exist at densities far beyond the thermal equilibrium level, potentially leading to dephasing and energy loss. In order to engineer superconductors with shorter overall quasiparticle lifetimes, we consider the impact of a proximity layer on the transport of quasiparticles in a superconductor. We find that a normal metal layer can be used to significantly increase the relaxation rate of quasiparticles in a superconductor, as seen by a large reduction in the quasiparticle charge imbalance in a fully proximitized Cu/Al bilayer wire. The mechanism for this effect may be useful for preventing quasiparticle poisoning of qubits using carefully chosen proximity bilayers consisting of clean superconductors and disordered normal metals.</description>

      <title>How polarization fields can be beneficial in nitride emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can actually enhance the overlap of electron and hole wave functions in III-nitride quantum wells, which are being considered for polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications. By systematically exploring the design space of AlInGaN heterostructures with machine learning, we uncover that larger electric fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emitters. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to reveal unexpected trends for informing the design of semiconductor heterostructures.</description>
