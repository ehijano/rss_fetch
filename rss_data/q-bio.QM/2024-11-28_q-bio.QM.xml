      <title>Understanding Immune Dynamics in Liver Transplant Through Mathematical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liver transplant can be a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage liver disease. With the introduction of modern immunosuppressive therapies, short-term survival has significantly improved. However, long-term survival has not substantially improved in decades. Consequently, causes of death are now more likely to be due to the toxicities and side-effects of long-term immunosuppression rather than rejection. In order to study the balance of immunosuppression and rejection, we developed the first mechanistic mathematical model of liver transplant and immune system dynamics. We determined key cells and interactions in the model using literature information; we then used sensitivity analysis to determine key pathways driving the health status of the transplanted liver. We found that dynamics related to cytotoxic T cells and IL-2, in addition to the liver itself, are key determinants of liver graft injury. This has significant implications for the use of tests to monitor patients, and therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat liver transplantation rejection. Future work to collect appropriate data and parametrize the model would be valuable in improving our understanding of the dynamics of this system. We also note that our model could be tailored to model transplant of other organs.</description>

      <title>Pan-protein Design Learning Enables Task-adaptive Generalization for Low-resource Enzyme Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational protein design (CPD) offers transformative potential for bioengineering, but current deep CPD models, focused on universal domains, struggle with function-specific designs. This work introduces a novel CPD paradigm tailored for functional design tasks, particularly for enzymes-a key protein class often lacking specific application efficiency. To address structural data scarcity, we present CrossDesign, a domain-adaptive framework that leverages pretrained protein language models (PPLMs). By aligning protein structures with sequences, CrossDesign transfers pretrained knowledge to structure models, overcoming the limitations of limited structural data. The framework combines autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) states in its encoder-decoder architecture, applying it to enzyme datasets and pan-proteins. Experimental results highlight CrossDesign's superior performance and robustness, especially with out-of-domain enzymes. Additionally, the model excels in fitness prediction when tested on large-scale mutation data, showcasing its stability.</description>

      <title>DapPep: Domain Adaptive Peptide-agnostic Learning for Universal T-cell Receptor-antigen Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying T-cell receptors (TCRs) that interact with antigenic peptides provides the technical basis for developing vaccines and immunotherapies. The emergent deep learning methods excel at learning antigen binding patterns from known TCRs but struggle with novel or sparsely represented antigens. However, binding specificity for unseen antigens or exogenous peptides is critical. We introduce a domain-adaptive peptide-agnostic learning framework DapPep for universal TCR-antigen binding affinity prediction to address this challenge. The lightweight self-attention architecture combines a pre-trained protein language model with an inner-loop self-supervised regime to enable robust TCR-peptide representations. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that DapPep consistently outperforms existing tools, showcasing robust generalization capability, especially for data-scarce settings and unseen peptides. Moreover, DapPep proves effective in challenging clinical tasks such as sorting reactive T cells in tumor neoantigen therapy and identifying key positions in 3D structures.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Integration of Longitudinal Noninvasive Diagnostics for Survival Prediction in Immunotherapy Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Analyzing noninvasive longitudinal and multimodal data using artificial intelligence could potentially transform immunotherapy for cancer patients, paving the way towards precision medicine. Methods: In this study, we integrated pre- and on-treatment blood measurements, prescribed medications and CT-based volumes of organs from a large pan-cancer cohort of 694 patients treated with immunotherapy to predict short and long-term overall survival. By leveraging a combination of recent developments, different variants of our extended multimodal transformer-based simple temporal attention (MMTSimTA) network were trained end-to-end to predict mortality at three, six, nine and twelve months. These models were also compared to baseline methods incorporating intermediate and late fusion based integration methods. Results: The strongest prognostic performance was demonstrated using the extended transformer-based multimodal model with area under the curves (AUCs) of $0.84 \pm $0.04, $0.83 \pm $0.02, $0.82 \pm $0.02, $0.81 \pm $0.03 for 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month survival prediction, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that analyzing integrated early treatment data has potential for predicting survival of immunotherapy patients. Integrating complementary noninvasive modalities into a jointly trained model, using our extended transformer-based architecture, demonstrated an improved multimodal prognostic performance, especially in short term survival prediction.</description>

      <title>Random feature baselines provide distributional performance and feature selection benchmarks for clinical and 'omic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying predictive features from high-dimensional datasets is a major task in biomedical research. However, it is difficult to determine the robustness of selected features. Here, we investigate the performance of randomly chosen features, what we term "random feature baselines" (RFBs), in the context of disease risk prediction from blood plasma proteomics data in the UK Biobank. We examine two published case studies predicting diagnosis of (1) dementia and (2) hip fracture. RFBs perform similarly to published proteins of interest (using the same number, randomly chosen). We then measure the performance of RFBs for all 607 disease outcomes in the UK Biobank, with various numbers of randomly chosen features, as well as all proteins in the dataset. 114/607 outcomes showed a higher mean AUROC when choosing 5 random features than using all proteins, and the absolute difference in mean AUC was 0.075. 163 outcomes showed a higher mean AUROC when choosing 1000 random features than using all proteins, and the absolute difference in mean AUC was 0.03. Incorporating RFBs should become part of ML practice when feature selection or target discovery is a goal.</description>

      <title>Assessing the similarity of real matrices with arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the similarity of matrices is valuable for analyzing the extent to which data sets exhibit common features in tasks such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, group comparison, and graph analysis. Methods proposed for comparing vectors, such as cosine similarity, can be readily generalized to matrices. However, this approach usually neglects the inherent two-dimensional structure of matrices. Here, we propose singular angle similarity (SAS), a measure for evaluating the structural similarity between two arbitrary, real matrices of the same shape based on singular value decomposition. After introducing the measure, we compare SAS with standard measures for matrix comparison and show that only SAS captures the two-dimensional structure of matrices. Further, we characterize the behavior of SAS in the presence of noise and as a function of matrix dimensionality. Finally, we apply SAS to two use cases: square non-symmetric matrices of probabilistic network connectivity, and non-square matrices representing neural brain activity. For synthetic data of network connectivity, SAS matches intuitive expectations and allows for a robust assessment of similarities and differences. For experimental data of brain activity, SAS captures differences in the structure of high-dimensional responses to different stimuli. We conclude that SAS is a suitable measure for quantifying the shared structure of matrices with arbitrary shape.</description>

      <title>What the %PCSA? Addressing Diversity in Lower-Limb Musculoskeletal Models: Age- and Sex-related Differences in PCSA and Muscle Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal (MSK) models offer a non-invasive way to understand biomechanical loads on joints and tendons, which are difficult to measure directly. Variations in muscle strength, especially relative differences between muscles, significantly impact model outcomes. Typically, scaled generic MSK models use maximum isometric forces that are not adjusted for different demographics, raising concerns about their accuracy. This review provides an overview on experimentally derived strength parameters, including physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), muscle mass (Mm), and relative muscle mass (%Mm), which is the relative distribution of muscle mass across the leg. We analysed differences by age and sex, and compared open-source lower limb MSK model parameters with experimental data from 57 studies. Our dataset, with records dating back to 1884, shows that uniformly increasing all maximum isometric forces in MSK models does not capture key muscle ratio differences due to age and sex. Males have a higher proportion of muscle mass in the rectus femoris and semimembranosus muscles, while females have a greater relative muscle mass in the pelvic (gluteus maximus and medius) and ankle muscles (tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and extensor digitorum longus). Older adults have a higher relative muscle mass in the gluteus medius, while younger individuals show more in the gastrocnemius. Current MSK models do not accurately represent muscle mass distribution for specific age or sex groups, and none of them accurately reflect female muscle mass distribution. Further research is needed to explore musculotendon age- and sex differences.</description>
