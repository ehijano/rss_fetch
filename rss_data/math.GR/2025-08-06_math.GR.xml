      <title>The essential $2$-dimension of the linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the essential $2$-dimension when the defining prime is odd of the general linear groups, the projective general linear groups, the special linear groups when $n$ is odd or $n = 2$, as well as the special linear groups and quotients of it (such as the projective special linear groups) in the case case $q \equiv 1 \mod 4$, $s = v_2(q-1)$, and $\Gamma = \text{Gal}(k(\zeta_{2^s})/k)$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>The symmetric groups $S_n, n\geq 4$, and finite non-abelian simple groups are not embeddable in any Riordan group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the symmetric group of degree greater than three cannot be embedded into the Riordan group with coefficients in any commutative ring. We also prove the impossibility to embed finite non-abelian simple groups. As a closely related topic, we show why all truncated Riordan groups are solvable, in stark contrast to the unsolvability of the infinite-sized Riordan groups. Finally, we give an explicit embedding of the alternating group $A_4$ into the Lagrange subgroup with coefficients in a certain commutative ring, and prove that $A_4$ cannot be embedded into a substitution group, and hence, a Nottingham group.</description>

      <title>On the isomorphism problem for generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups: angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new isomorphism invariant for generalized Baumslag-Solitar (GBS) groups, which we call the limit angle. Unlike previously known invariants, which are primarily algebraic, the limit angle admits a dynamical interpretation, arising exclusively in the case of two interacting edges. This invariant captures subtle geometric behavior that does not manifest in configurations with more interacting edges. As an application, we use the limit angle to obtain a classification of GBS groups with one vertex and two edges.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Computing Hopf--Galois Structures and Skew Bracoids of Low Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making use of the fact that Hopf-Galois structures on separable extensions and skew bracoids are both intrinsically connected to transitive subgroups of the holomorph, we present an algorithm to classify and enumerate these objects in several low degree cases. Our approach allows us to greatly extend existing computational results for Hopf-Galois structures, while building on the existing algorithms presented in this area.</description>

      <title>Hopf-Galois structures on separable field extensions of degree related to Cunningham chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past few years have seen Hopf--Galois structures on extensions of squarefree degree studied in various contexts. The Galois case was fully explored by Alabdali and Byott in 2020, followed by a first attempt at generalising these results to include non-normal extensions by Byott and Martin-Lyons; their work looks at separable extensions of degree $pq$ with $p,q$ distinct odd primes, and $p=2q+1$. This paper extends the latter work further by considering separable extensions of squarefree degree $n=p_1...p_m$ where each pair of consecutive primes $p_i,p_{i+1}$ are related by $p_i=2p_{i+1}+1$.</description>

      <title>On the intersections of nilpotent subgroups in simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H_p$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. A very recent conjecture of Lisi and Sabatini asserts the existence of an element $x \in G$ such that $H_p \cap H_p^x$ is inclusion-minimal in the set $\{H_p \cap H_p^g \,:\, g \in G\}$ for every prime $p$. This has been proved in several special cases, including all sufficiently large symmetric and alternating groups. For a simple group $G$, in view of a theorem of Mazurov and Zenkov from 1996, the conjecture implies the existence of an element $x \in G$ with $H_p \cap H_p^x = 1$ for all $p$. In turn, this statement implies a conjecture of Vdovin from 2002, which asserts that if $G$ is simple and $H$ is a nilpotent subgroup, then $H \cap H^x = 1$ for some $x \in G$.
  In this paper, we adopt a probabilistic approach to prove the Lisi-Sabatini conjecture for all non-alternating simple groups. By combining this with earlier work of Kurmazov on nilpotent subgroups of alternating groups, we complete the proof of Vdovin's conjecture. Moreover, by combining our proof for groups of Lie type with earlier work of Zenkov on alternating and sporadic groups, we are able to establish a stronger form of Vdovin's conjecture: if $G$ is simple and $A,B$ are nilpotent subgroups, then $A \cap B^x = 1$ for some $x \in G$. In addition, we study the asymptotic probability that a random pair of Sylow $p$-subgroups in a simple group of Lie type intersect trivially, complementing recent work of Diaconis et al. and Eberhard on symmetric and alternating groups.</description>

      <title>On the diameter and girth of zero-divisor graphs of inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an inverse semigroup with zero and let $Z(S)^\times$ be its set of non-zero divisors with respect to the natural partial order $\le $ on $S$, that is, $a \in Z(S)^\times $ if there exists $b\in S\setminus\{0\}$ with $\omega(a, b) = \{c \in S: c \leq a\ \mbox{and}\ c \leq b\}=\{0\}$. The set $Z(S)^\times$ makes up the vertices of the corresponding {\it zero-divisor graph} $\Gamma (S)$, with two distinct vertices $a, b$ forming an edge if $\omega(a, b)=\{0\}$. We characterize {\it zero-divisor graphs} of inverse semigroups in terms of their diameter and girth. We also classify inverse semigroups without zero by building a connection between the diameter (girth) and the least group congruence $\sigma$ on an inverse semigroup without zero. Finally, we give a description of the diameter and girth of graph inverse semigoups $I(G)$ in terms of the set of vertices and the set of edges of a graph $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite non-cyclic, non-characteristically simple group with the property that all proper characteristic subgroups of $G$ are cyclic. We call such a group $\mathrm{CCS}$ group, short for \emph{Characteristic Cyclic}. In this paper, we provide a complete classification of these groups. As an application of our main result, we also make some progress toward the classification of minimal non-cyclic skew braces.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for graph product von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish rigidity theorems for graph product von Neumann algebras $M_\Gamma=*_{v,\Gamma}M_v$ associated to finite simple graphs $\Gamma$ and families of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M_v)_{v\in\Gamma}$. We consider the following three broad classes of vertex algebras: diffuse, diffuse amenable, and II$_1$ factors. In each of these three regimes, we exhibit a large class of graphs $\Gamma,\Lambda$ for which the following holds: any isomorphism $\theta$ between $M_\Gamma$ and $N_\Lambda$ ensures the existence of a graph isomorphism $\alpha:\Gamma\to\Lambda$, and tight relations between $\theta(M_v)$ and $N_{\alpha(v)}$ for every vertex $v\in\Gamma$, ranging from strong intertwining in both directions (in the sense of Popa), to unitary conjugacy in some cases.
  Our results lead to a wide range of applications to the classification of graph product von Neumann algebras and the calculation of their symmetry groups. First, we obtain general classification theorems for von Neumann algebras of right-angled Artin groups and of graph products of ICC groups. We also provide a new family of II$_1$ factors with trivial fundamental group, including all graph products of II$_1$ factors over graphs with girth at least $5$ and no vertices of degree $0$ or $1$. Finally, we compute the outer automorphism group of certain graph products of II$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>Liouville property for groups and conformal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14545v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal dimension is a fundamental invariant of metric spaces, particularly suited to the study of self-similar spaces, such as spaces with an expanding self-covering (e.g. Julia sets of complex rational functions). The dynamics of these systems are encoded by the associated iterated monodromy groups, which are examples of contracting self-similar groups. Their amenability is a well-known open question. We show that if $G$ is an iterated monodromy group, and if the (Alfhors-regular) conformal dimension of the underlying space is strictly less than 2, then every symmetric random walk with finite second moment on $G$ has the Liouville property. As a corollary, every such group is amenable. This criterion applies to all examples of contracting groups previously known to be amenable, and to many new ones. In particular, it implies that for every sub-hyperbolic complex rational function $f$ whose Julia set is not the whole sphere, the iterated monodromy group of $f$ is amenable.</description>

      <title>Analogs of the lower and upper central series in skew braces: a survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A skew brace is a ring-like and group-like algebraic structure that was introduced in the study of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. In this survey paper, we shall consider the left series, right series, socle series, and annihilator series of skew braces. They may be regarded as analogs of the lower and upper central series of groups. Other than some well-known facts regarding these series, we shall prove several new results about the relationship among their terms. We shall also consider the lower central series of skew braces that was defined by Bonatto and Jedli\v{c}ka. As we shall explain, it seems to be the ``correct" analog of the lower central series for skew braces. Concerning this, we shall also discuss the notion of the lower central series of ideals that is due to Ballester-Bolinches et al.</description>

      <title>On the intersections of Sylow subgroups in almost simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite almost simple group and let $H$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. As a special case of a theorem of Zenkov, there exist $x,y \in G$ such that $H \cap H^x \cap H^y = 1$. In fact, if $G$ is simple, then a theorem of Mazurov and Zenkov reveals that $H \cap H^x = 1$ for some $x \in G$. However, it is known that the latter property does not extend to all almost simple groups. For example, if $G = S_8$ and $p=2$, then $H \cap H^x \ne 1$ for all $x \in G$. Further work of Zenkov in the 1990s shows that such examples are rare (for instance, there are no such examples if $p \geqslant 5$) and he reduced the classification of all such pairs to the situation where $p=2$ and $G$ is an almost simple group of Lie type defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and either $q=9$ or $q$ is a Mersenne or Fermat prime. In this paper, by adopting a probabilistic approach based on fixed point ratio estimates, we complete Zenkov's classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.11212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topology is defined on the mapping class group of a compact connected orientable surface. It is shown that a notion of "genericity" on subsets of the mapping class group arises from this definition. Many plausible results follow from this notion easily; for example, the set of pseudo-Anosov maps is shown to be generic, and can be assumed to have arbitrary large stretch factor, generically. Let M be a 3-manifold obtained from a Heegaard splitting of fixed genus g and generic gluing map. It is shown that for such manifolds, generically M is hyperbolic, has first Betti number zero and Heegaard genus exactly equal to g.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03429v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that there is a mapping class group-equivariant deformation retraction of the Teichm\"uller space of a closed, orientable surface onto a cell complex of dimension equal to the virtual cohomological dimension of the mapping class group. The image of the deformation retraction is contained in the CW complex first described by Thurston -- the Thurston spine. The Thurston spine is the set of points in Teichm\"uller space corresponding to hyperbolic surfaces for which the set of shortest geodesics (the systoles) cuts the surface into polygons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of $k$-integral graphs. A graph $\Gamma$ is called $k$-integral if the extension degree of the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial of $\Gamma$ over rational field $\mathbb Q$ is equal to $k$. We prove that the set of all finite connected graphs with given algebraic degree and maximum degree is finite. $1$-integral graphs are just integral ones, graphs all of whose eigenvalues are integer. We study
  $2$-integral Cayley graphs over finite groups $G$ with respect to Cayley sets which are a union of conjugacy classes of $G$. Among other general results, we completely characterize all finite abelian groups having a connected $2$-integral Cayley graph with valency $2,3,4$ and $5$.
  Furthermore, we classify finite groups $G$ for which all Cayley graphs over $G$ with bounded valency are $2$-integral.</description>
