      <title>Small noise fluctuations and large deviations of conservative SPDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem and large deviations principle that characterises small noise fluctuations of the generalised Dean--Kawasaki stochastic PDE. The fluctuations agree to first order with fluctuations of certain interacting particle systems, such as the zero range process, about their hydrodynamic limits. Our main contribution is that we are able to consider stochastic PDEs on general $C^2$ bounded domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. On the level of particles, the boundary condition corresponds to absorption or injection of particles at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Principle for Last Passage Percolation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of the KPZ universality class has seen the emergence of universal objects over the past decade which arrive as the scaling limit of the member models. One such object is the directed landscape, and it is known that exactly solvable last passage percolation (LPP) models converge to the directed landscape under the KPZ scaling. Large deviations of the directed landscape on the metric level were recently studied in arXiv:2405.14924, which also provides a general framework for establishing such large deviation principle (LDP). The main goal of the article is to employ and tweak that framework to establish a LDP for LPP models at the metric level without assuming exact solvability. We then use the LDP on the metric level to establish a LDP for geodesics in these models, providing a streamlined way to study large transversal fluctuations of geodesics in these models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Yule's nonsense correlation for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck paths: The correlated case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the continuous-time version of the empirical correlation coefficient between the paths of two possibly correlated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, known as Yule's nonsense correlation for these paths. Using sharp tools from the analysis on Wiener chaos, we establish the asymptotic normality of the fluctuations of this correlation coefficient around its long-time limit, which is the mathematical correlation coefficient between the two processes. This asymptotic normality is quantified in Kolmogorov distance, which allows us to establish speeds of convergence in the Type-II error for two simple tests of independence of the paths, based on the empirical correlation, and based on its numerator. An application to independence of two observations of solutions to the stochastic heat equation is given, with excellent asymptotic power properties using merely a small number of the solutions' Fourier modes.</description>

      <title>Approximating fluid queues with quasi birth-and-death processes with rational arrival process components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fluid queue is a stochastic process which moves linearly with a rate that is determined by the state of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this paper we construct an approximation to a fluid queue using a quasi birth-and-death process with rational arrival process components (QBD-RAP) and prove weak convergence via convergence of generators. The primary motivation for constructing the new approximation is to achieve a better approximation accuracy than existing methods while also ensuring that all approximations to probabilities have all probabilistic properties, such as non-negativity and bounded above by 1.</description>

      <title>Sample-Path Large Deviations for Functionals of Poisson Cluster Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sample-path large deviation principles for the centered cumulative functional of marked Poisson cluster processes in the Skorokhod space equipped with the M1 topology, under joint regular variation assumptions on the marks and the offspring distributions governing the propagation mechanism. These findings can also be interpreted as hidden regular variation of the cluster processes' functionals, extending the results in Dombry et al. (2022) to cluster processes with heavy-tailed characteristics, including mixed Binomial Poisson cluster processes and Hawkes processes. Notably, by restricting to the adequate subspace of measures on D([0, 1], R+), and applying the correct normalization and scaling to the paths of the centered cumulative functional, the limit measure concentrates on paths with multiple large jumps.</description>

      <title>Mean convergence rates for Gaussian-smoothed Wasserstein distances and classical Wasserstein distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish upper bounds for the expected Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein distance between a probability measure $\mu$ and the corresponding empirical measure $\mu_N$, whenever $\mu$ has finite $q$-th moments for any $q&gt;p$. This generalizes recent results that were valid only for $q&gt;2p+2d$. We provide two distinct proofs of such a result. We also use a third upper bound for the Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein distance to derive an upper bound for the classical $p$-Wasserstein distance. Although the latter upper bound is not optimal when $\mu$ has finite $q$-th moment with $q&gt;p$, this bound does not require imposing such a moment condition on $\mu$, as it is usually done in the literature.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of the Laplacian of Scale-Free Percolation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider scale-free percolation on a discrete torus $\mathbf{V}_N$ of size $N$. Conditionally on an i.i.d. sequence of Pareto weights $(W_i)_{i\in \mathbf{V}_N}$ with tail exponent $\tau-1&gt;0$, we connect any two points $i$ and $j$ on the torus with probability
  $$p_{ij}= \frac{W_iW_j}{\|i-j\|^{\alpha}} \wedge 1$$ for some parameter $\alpha&gt;0$.
  We focus on the (centred) Laplacian operator of this random graph and study its empirical spectral distribution. We explicitly identify the limiting distribution when $\alpha&lt;1$ and $\tau&gt;3$, in terms of the spectral distribution of some non-commutative unbounded operators.</description>

      <title>Convex order and increasing convex order for McKean-Vlasov processes with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish results on the conditional and standard convex order, as well as the increasing convex order, for two processes $ X = (X_t)_{t \in [0, T]} $ and $ Y = (Y_t)_{t \in [0, T]}$, defined by the following McKean-Vlasov equations with common Brownian noise $B^0 = (B_t^0)_{t \in [0, T]}$: \begin{align} dX_t &amp;= b(t, X_t, \mathcal{L}^1(X_t))dt + \sigma(t, X_t, \mathcal{L}^1(X_t))dB_t + \sigma^0(t, \mathcal{L}^1(X_t))dB^0_t, \\ dY_t &amp;= \beta(t, Y_t, \mathcal{L}^1(Y_t))dt + \theta(t, Y_t, \mathcal{L}^1(Y_t))dB_t + \theta^0(t, \mathcal{L}^1(Y_t))dB^0_t, \end{align} where $\mathcal{L}^1(X_t)$ (respectively $\mathcal{L}^1(Y_t)$) denotes a version of the conditional distribution of $X_t$ (resp. $Y_t$) given $B^0$. These results extend those established for standard McKean-Vlasov equations in [Liu and Pag\`es, Ann. App. Prob. 2023] and [Liu and Pag\`es, Bernoulli 2022]. Under suitable conditions, for a (non-decreasing) convex functional $F$ on the path space with polynomial growth, we show $\mathbb{E}[F(X) \mid B^0] \leq \mathbb{E}[F(Y) \mid B^0]$ almost surely. Moreover, for a (non-decreasing) convex functional $G$ defined on the product space of paths and their marginal distributions, we establish \[ \mathbb{E} \Big[\,G\big(X, (\mathcal{L}^1(X_t))_{t\in[0, T]}\big)\,\Big| \, B^0\,\Big]\leq \mathbb{E} \Big[\,G\big(Y, (\mathcal{L}^1(Y_t))_{t\in[0, T]}\big)\,\Big| \, B^0\,\Big] \quad \text{almost surely}. \] Similar convex order results are also established for the corresponding particle system. We explore applications of these results to stochastic control problem - deducing in particular an associated comparison principle for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with different coefficients - and to the interbank systemic risk model introduced by in [Carmona, Fouque and Sun, Comm. in Math. Sci. 2015].</description>

      <title>Extremal negative dependence and the strongly Rayleigh property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a geometrical characterization of extremal negative dependence as a convex polytope in the simplex of multidimensional Bernoulli distributions, and we prove that it is an antichain that satisfies some minimality conditions with respect to the strongest negative dependence orders. We study the strongly Rayleigh property within this class and explicitly find a distribution that satisfies this property by maximizing the entropy. Furthermore, we construct a chain for the supermodular order starting from extremal negative dependence to independence by mixing the maximum entropy strongly Rayleigh distribution with independence.</description>

      <title>The $q^{\mathrm{Volume}}$ lozenge tiling model via non-Hermitian orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $q^\text{Volume}$ lozenge tiling model on a large, finite hexagon. It is well-known that random lozenge tilings of the hexagon correspond to a two-dimensional determinantal point process via a bijection with ensembles of non-intersecting paths. The starting point of our analysis is a formula for the correlation kernel due to Duits and Kuijlaars which involves the Christoffel-Darboux kernel of a particular family of non-Hermitian orthogonal polynomials. Our main results are split into two parts: the first part concerns the family of orthogonal polynomials, and the second concerns the behavior of the boundary of the so-called arctic curve. In the first half, we identify the orthogonal polynomials as a non-standard instance of little $q$-Jacobi polynomials and compute their large degree asymptotics in the $q \to 1$ regime. A consequence of this analysis is a proof that the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials accumulate on an arc of a circle and an asymptotic formula for the Christoffel-Darboux kernel. In the second half, we use these asymptotics to show that the boundary of the liquid region converges to the Airy process, in the sense of finite dimensional distributions, away from the boundary of the hexagon. At inflection points of the arctic curve, we show that we do not need to subtract/add a parabola to the Airy line ensemble, and this effect persists at distances which are $o(N^{-2/9})$ in the tangent direction.</description>

      <title>Graph Quasirandomness for Hypothesis Testing of Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated theorem of Chung, Graham, and Wilson on quasirandom graphs implies that if the 4-cycle and edge counts in a graph $G$ are both close to their typical number in $\mathbb{G}(n,1/2),$ then this also holds for the counts of subgraphs isomorphic to $H$ for any $H$ of constant size. We aim to prove a similar statement where the notion of close is whether the given (signed) subgraph count can be used as a test between $\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and a stochastic block model $\mathbb{SBM}.$
  Quantitatively, this is related to approximately maximizing $H \longrightarrow |\Phi(H)|^{\frac{1}{|\mathsf{V}(H)|}},$ where $\Phi(H)$ is the Fourier coefficient of $\mathbb{SBM}$, indexed by subgraph $H.$ This formulation turns out to be equivalent to approximately maximizing the partition function of a spin model over alphabet equal to the community labels in $\mathbb{SBM}.$
  We resolve the approximate maximization when $\mathbb{SBM}$ satisfies one of four conditions: 1) the probability of an edge between any two vertices in different communities is exactly $1/2$; 2) the probability of an edge between two vertices from any two communities is at least $1/2$ (this case is also covered in a recent work of Yu, Zadik, and Zhang); 3) the probability of belonging to any given community is at least $c$ for some universal constant $c&gt;0$; 4) $\mathbb{SBM}$ has two communities. In each of these cases, we show that there is an approximate maximizer of $|\Phi(H)|^{\frac{1}{|\mathsf{V}(H)|}}$ in the set $\mathsf{A} = \{\text{stars, 4-cycle}\}.$ This implies that if there exists a constant-degree polynomial test distinguishing $\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and $\mathbb{SBM},$ then the two distributions can also be distinguished via the signed count of some graph in $\mathsf{A}.$ We conjecture that the same holds true for distinguishing $\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and any graphon if we also add triangles to $\mathsf{A}.$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability and dynamics of solitons in the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in the presence of noise and deterministic forcing. The noise is space-dependent and statistically translation-invariant. We show that, for small forcing, solitons remain close to the family of traveling waves in a weighted Sobolev norm, with high probability. We study the effective dynamics of the soliton amplitude and position via their variational phase, for which we derive explicit modulation equations. The stability result holds on a time scale where the deterministic forcing induces significant amplitude modulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the tail asymptotics of two functionals (the maximum and the sum of the marks) of a generic cluster in two sub-models of the marked Poisson cluster process, namely the renewal Poisson cluster process and the Hawkes process. Under the hypothesis that the governing components of the processes are regularly varying, we extend results due to [18] and [5] notably, relying on Karamata's Tauberian Theorem to do so. We use these asymptotics to derive precise large deviation results in the fashion of [30] for the above-mentioned processes.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandomness of the Sticky Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the pseudorandomness of random walks on expander graphs using the sticky random walk. Building on prior works, it was recently shown that expander random walks can fool all symmetric functions in total variation distance (TVD) upto an $O(\lambda(\frac{p}{\min f})^{O(p)})$ error, where $\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the expander, $p$ is the size of the arbitrary alphabet used to label the vertices, and $\min f = \min_{b\in[p]} f_b$, where $f_b$ is the fraction of vertices labeled $b$ in the graph. Golowich and Vadhan conjecture that the dependency on the $(\frac{p}{\min f})^{O(p)}$ term is not tight. In this paper, we resolve the conjecture in the affirmative for a family of expanders. We present a generalization of the sticky random walk for which Golowich and Vadhan predict a TVD upper bound of $O(\lambda p^{O(p)})$ using a Fourier-analytic approach. For this family of graphs, we use a combinatorial approach involving the Krawtchouk functions to derive a strengthened TVD of $O(\lambda)$. Furthermore, we present equivalencies between the generalized sticky random walk, and, using linear-algebraic techniques, show that the generalized sticky random walk parameterizes an infinite family of expander graphs.</description>

Abstract: We study the voter model on Z with long-range interactions, as proposed by Hammond and Sheffield. We show a spacetime rescaling converges to a fractional Gaussian free field, which can be viewed as a one-parameter family of fractional Brownian motions. As a consequence, we obtain that long-range voter models rescale to fractional Gaussian noise. The argument uses the Lindeberg swapping technique and heat kernel estimates for random walks with jump distributions in the domain of attraction of a stable law.</description>

      <title>Catalan percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Catalan percolation, all nearest-neighbor edges $\{i,i+1\}$ along $\mathbb Z$ are initially occupied, and all other edges are open independently with probability $p$. Open edges $\{i,j\}$ are occupied if some pair of edges $\{i,k\}$ and $\{k,j\}$, with $i&lt;k&lt;j$, become occupied. This model was introduced by Gravner and the third author, in the context of polluted graph bootstrap percolation.
  We prove that the critical $p_{\mathrm c}$ is strictly between that of oriented site percolation on $\mathbb Z^2$ and the Catalan growth rate $1/4$. Our main result shows that an enhanced oriented percolation model, with non-decaying infinite-range dependency, has a strictly smaller critical parameter than the classical model. This is reminiscent of the work of Duminil-Copin, Hil\'ario, Kozma and Sidoravicius on brochette percolation. Our proof differs, however, in that we do not use Aizenman--Grimmett enhancements or differential inequalities. Two key ingredients are the work of Hil\'ario, S\'a, Sanchis and Teixeira on stretched lattices, and the Russo--Seymour--Welsh result for oriented percolation by Duminil-Copin, Tassion and Teixeira.</description>

      <title>Classification of the limit shape for 1+1-dimensional FPP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified model of planar first passage percolation where weights along vertical edges are deterministic. We show that the limit shape has a flat edge in the vertical direction if and only if the random distribution of the horizontal edges has an atom at the infimum of its support. Furthermore, we present bounds on the upper and lower derivative of the time constant.</description>

      <title>Stability of travelling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion equations driven by additive noise with H\"older continuous paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate stability of travelling wave solutions to a class of reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive noise with H\"older continuous paths, covering in particular fractional Brownian motion with general Hurst index. We obtain long- and short time asymptotic error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts. These bounds, in terms of Hurst index and H\"older exponent, apply to a large class of infinite-dimensional self-similar drivers with H\"older continuous paths, such as linear fractional stable motion. We find that for short times, higher Hurst indices imply higher stability, while for large times, the difference of Hurst index to H\"older exponent influences the size of scaling exponents of the noise amplitude that are sufficient to ensure stability.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Parisi measures for enriched convex vector spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the PDE approach to mean-field spin glasses, it has been observed that the free energy of convex spin glass models could be enriched by adding an extra parameter in its definition, and that the thermodynamic limit of the enriched free energy satisfies a partial differential equation. This parameter can be thought of as a matrix-valued path, and the usual free energy is recovered by setting this parameter to be the constant path taking only the value $0$. Furthermore, the enriched free energy can be expressed using a variational formula, which is a natural extension of the Parisi formula for the usual free energy. For models with scalar spins the Parisi formula can be expressed as an optimization problem over a convex set, and it was shown in [arXiv:1402.5132] that this problem has a unique optimizer thanks to a strict convexity property. For models with vector spins, the Parisi formula cannot easily be written as a convex optimization problem. In this paper, we generalize the uniqueness of Parisi measures proven in [arXiv:1402.5132] to the enriched free energy of models with vector spins when the extra parameter is a strictly increasing path. Our approach relies on a Gateaux differentiability property of the free energy and the envelope theorem.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit for supercritical nearly unstable Hawkes processes with heavy tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the asymptotic behavior of {\it supercritical} nearly unstable Hawkes processes with a power law kernel. We find that, the Hawkes process in our context admits a similar equation to that in \cite{MR3563196} for {\it subcritical} case. In particular, the rescaled Hawkes process $(Z^n_{nt}/n^{2\alpha})_{t\in[0,1]}$ converges in law to a kind of integrated fractional Cox Ingersoll Ross process with different coefficients from that in \cite{MR3563196}, as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Mixtures Models with Repulsive and Attractive Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09034v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of almost surely discrete random probability measures is an active line of research in Bayesian nonparametrics. The idea of assuming interaction across the atoms of the random probability measure has recently spurred significant interest in the context of Bayesian mixture models. This allows the definition of priors that encourage well-separated and interpretable clusters. In this work, we provide a unified framework for the construction and the Bayesian analysis of random probability measures with interacting atoms, encompassing both repulsive and attractive behaviours. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the posterior distribution, the marginal and predictive distributions, which were not previously available except for the case of measures with i.i.d. atoms. We show how these quantities are fundamental both for prior elicitation and to develop new posterior simulation algorithms for hierarchical mixture models. Our results are obtained without any assumption on the finite point process that governs the atoms of the random measure. Their proofs rely on analytical tools borrowed from the Palm calculus theory, which might be of independent interest. We specialise our treatment to the classes of Poisson, Gibbs, and determinantal point processes, as well as in the case of shot-noise Cox processes. Finally, we illustrate the performance of different modelling strategies on simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Throughput-Optimal Scheduling Algorithms for LLM Inference and AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents rapidly grows, optimizing systems for efficient LLM inference becomes critical. While significant efforts have focused on system-level engineering, little is explored from a mathematical modeling and queuing perspective.
  In this paper, we aim to develop the queuing fundamentals for large language model (LLM) inference, bridging the gap between the queueing theory and LLM system communities. In particular, we study the throughput aspect in LLM inference systems. We prove that a large class of 'work-conserving' scheduling algorithms can achieve maximum throughput for individual inference LLM engine, highlighting 'work-conserving' as a key design principle in practice. In a network of LLM agents, work-conserving scheduling alone is insufficient, particularly when facing specific workload structures and multi-class workflows that require more sophisticated scheduling strategies. Evaluations of real-world systems show that Orca and Sarathi-serve are throughput-optimal, reassuring practitioners, while FasterTransformer and vanilla vLLM are not maximally stable and should be used with caution. Our results highlight the substantial benefits that the queueing community can offer in improving LLM inference systems and call for more interdisciplinary development.</description>
