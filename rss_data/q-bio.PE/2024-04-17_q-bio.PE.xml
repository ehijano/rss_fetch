      <title>Convergence of reputations under indirect reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has shown how indirect reciprocity can promote cooperation through evolutionary game theoretic models. Most work in this field assumes a separation of time-scales: individuals' reputations equilibrate at a fast time scale for given frequencies of strategies while the strategies change slowly according to the replicator dynamics. Much of the previous research has focused on the behaviour and stability of equilibria for the replicator dynamics. Here we focus on the underlying reputational dynamics that occur on a fast time scale. We describe reputational dynamics as systems of differential equations and conduct stability analyses on their equilibria. We prove that reputations converge to a unique equilibrium for each of the five standard norms whether assessments are public or private. These results confirm a crucial but previously unconfirmed assumption underlying the theory of indirect reciprocity for the most studied set of norms.</description>

      <title>On inverse problems in multi-population aggregation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on inverse problems arising in studying multi-population aggregations. The goal is to reconstruct the diffusion coefficient, advection coefficient, and interaction kernels of the aggregation system, which characterize the dynamics of different populations. In the theoretical analysis of the physical setup, it is crucial to ensure non-negativity of solutions. To address this, we employ the high-order variation method and introduce modifications to the systems. Additionally, we propose a novel approach called transformative asymptotic technique that enables the recovery of the diffusion coefficient preceding the Laplace operator, presenting a pioneering method for this type of problems. Through these techniques, we offer comprehensive insights into the unique identifiability aspect of inverse problems associated with multi-population aggregation models.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling of the first HIV/ZIKV co-infection cases in Colombia and Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical model to investigate co-infection with HIV/AIDS and zika virus (ZIKV) in Colombia and Brazil, where the first cases were reported in 2015-2016. The model considers the sexual transmission dynamics of both viruses and vector-host interactions. We begin by exploring the qualitative behaviour of each model separately. Then, we analyze the dynamics of the co-infection model using the thresholds and results defined separately for each model. The model also considers the impact of intervention strategies, such as, personal protection, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and sexual protection (condoms use). Using available parameter values for Colombia and Brazil, the model is calibrated to predict the potential effect of implementing combinations of those intervention strategies on the co-infection spread. According to these findings, transmission through sexual contact is a determining factor in the long-term behaviour of these two diseases. Furthermore, it is important to note that co-infection with HIV and ZIKV may result in higher rates of HIV transmission and an increased risk of severe congenital disabilities linked to ZIKV infection. As a result, control measures have been implemented to limit the number of infected individuals and mosquitoes, with the aim of halting disease transmission. This study provides novel insights into the dynamics of HIV/ZIKV co-infection and highlights the importance of integrated intervention strategies in controlling the spread of these viruses, which may impact public health</description>

      <title>An Information Theory Treatment of Animal Movement Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional track of an animal on a landscape has progressed over the past three decades from hourly to second-by-second recordings of locations. Track segmentation methods for analyzing the behavioral information in such relocation data has lagged somewhat behind, with scales of analysis currently at the sub-hourly to minute level. A new approach is needed to bring segmentation analysis down to a second-by-second level. Here, such an approach is presented that rests heavily on concepts from Shannon's Information Theory. In this paper, we first briefly review and update concepts relating to movement path segmentation. We then discuss how cluster analysis can be used to organize the smallest viable statistical movement elements (StaMEs), which are $\mu$ steps long, and to code the next level of movement elements called ``words'' that are $m \mu$ steps long. Centroids of these word clusters are identified as canonical activity modes (CAMs). Unlike current segmentation schemes, the approach presented here allows us to provide entropy measures for movement paths, compute the coding efficiencies of derived StaMEs and CAMs, and assess error rates in the allocation of strings of $m$ StaMEs to CAM types. In addition our approach allows us to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure to assess and compare the best choices for the various parameters (number of steps in a StaME, number of StaME types, number of StaMEs in a word, number of CAM types), as well as the best clustering methods for generating segments that can then be used to interpret and predict sequences of higher order segments. The theory presented here provides another tool in our toolbox for dealing with the effects of global change on the movement and redistribution of animals across altered landscapes</description>

      <title>Accounting for contact network uncertainty in epidemic inferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When modeling the dynamics of infectious disease, the incorporation of contact network information allows for the capture of the non-randomness and heterogeneity of realistic contact patterns. Oftentimes, it is assumed that the underlying contact pattern is known with perfect certainty. However, in realistic settings, the observed data often serves as an imperfect proxy of the actual contact patterns in the population. Furthermore, the epidemic in the real world are often not fully observed; event times such as infection and recovery times may be missing. In order to conduct accurate inferences on parameters of contagion spread, it is crucial to incorporate these sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose the use of Mixture Density Network compressed ABC (MDN-ABC) to learn informative summary statistics for the available data. This method will allow for Bayesian inference on the epidemic parameters of a contagious process, while accounting for imperfect observations on the epidemic and the contact network. We will demonstrate the use of this method on simulated epidemics and networks, and extend this framework to analyze the spread of Tattoo Skin Disease (TSD) among bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia.</description>
