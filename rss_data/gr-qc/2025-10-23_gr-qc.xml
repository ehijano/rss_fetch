      <title>Time-Dependent Black Hole Lensing and the Unified Weak-to-Strong Deflection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical framework that unifies weak-field and strong-deflection lensing of light in a time-dependent, perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime. The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric, even-parity quasinormal mode with $\ell=2$, $m=0$ and complex frequency $\omega$. Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while keeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent line-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a static observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic expansion yields the familiar weak-field $1/b$ law with a ringdown-frequency correction that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere expansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic strong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small oscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the background static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities like centroid motion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, and photon-ring morphology are gauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing that the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius modulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field correction. The result is a coherent, purely theoretical account of how ringdown physics imprints on imaging observables without numerical ray tracing.</description>

      <title>Statistical Constraints on Anisotropic Bianchi-III Cosmology in $f(R,T)$-Gravity Using MCMC Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic Bianchi type-III cosmology is examined within the framework of f(R,T) gravity, where R denotes the Ricci scalar and T the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In this work, we investigate the statistical constraints on anisotropic Bianchi type-III cosmology within the framework of f(R,T) gravity. The specific choice $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ is considered and exact solutions are derived for the background dynamics of the model. The physical parameters, such as the Hubble parameter H(z), spatial volume V(z), energy density $\rho(z)$, and pressure p(z), are derived and their evolutionary behaviors are analyzed. To examine the observational viability of the model, we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and perform a comprehensive statistical analysis using the latest observational datasets, including the Hubble parameter measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Pantheon compilation of type Ia supernovae. The combined data analysis provides constraints on the free parameters of the model and allows a comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results show that the anisotropic Bianchi-III universe in f(R,T) gravity can successfully accommodate current observational data, offering new insights into the role of matter-geometry coupling in the late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Simple Analytic Estimate of Black Hole Shadow Size in an Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent shadow of a black hole provides one of the most direct probes of strong-field general relativity. While the shadow size in asymptotically flat spacetimes is well understood, the influence of cosmic expansion on its apparent angular diameter remains less explored. In this work, we present a simple analytic framework to estimate the shadow size of a non-rotating black hole embedded in an expanding universe. By combining the local Schwarzschild geometry with large-scale cosmological dynamics through the McVittie and Kottler metrics, we derive a compact relation between the shadow angular size and the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. This approach captures the essential dependence on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, while remaining analytically tractable. We further perform numerical estimates to quantify the redshift dependence of the apparent shadow size, showing that the effect of cosmic expansion is negligible for nearby sources but becomes relevant for high-redshift black holes. Our results demonstrate a clear conceptual connection between strong-gravity optics and cosmological expansion, providing a pedagogically transparent and physically motivated extension of black hole shadow theory to a cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Tracing Inflationary Imprints Through the Dark Ages: Implications for Early Stars and Galaxies Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how inflationary features shape the early stages of cosmic structure formation. Using the transfer function formalism, we trace the evolution of primordial perturbations, showing how causal physics and oscillatory signatures from inflation influence the matter power spectrum. The variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation. Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and disk properties of high-redshift systems. Our results indicate that oscillatory features from inflation can leave measurable imprints on halo abundances and early galaxy properties, providing a testable link between high-energy physics and astrophysical observations with JWST</description>

      <title>Detecting White Dwarf Binary Mergers with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers of white dwarf binaries are a possible progenitor channel for Type Ia supernovae. While white dwarfs are abundant in the universe and relatively well understood, their gravitational wave signals have not yet been directly observed. In order to detect gravitational waves from merging white dwarf binaries, a detector in the mid-band between LVK and LISA appears necessary. In this paper, we compute and discuss the gravitational waves emitted by inspiraling and merging white dwarf binaries, and assess their detectability with proposed space-based atom-interferometer detectors such as MAGIS Space and AEDGE. Gravitational waves from massive white dwarf binaries can be observed for many years before merger, offering a unique early warning of their final explosion. Our projections suggest that MAGIS Space could detect signals from Type Ia supernova progenitors at least once every four years, while AEDGE could observe at least a few hundred such events annually. The prolonged gravitational wave emission captured by atom-interferometers provides precise sky localisation and can allow observation of the final explosion with electromagnetic telescopes. The combined observation with electromagnetic radiation from the white dwarf binary coalescence could open a new pathway for multi-messenger astronomy involving some of the brightest transient events in the universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Swift Memory Burden Effect with GW250114-like Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a binary black hole coalescence. Motivated by the recent proposal that a black hole's information load can alter its classical response to small perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how the gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 5$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer. Our results disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Dephasing in binary black hole mergers surrounded by scalar wave dark matter clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar fields of masses between $10^{-21}\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-11} \rm{eV}/c^2$ can exhibit enhanced gravitational interactions with black holes, and form scalar clouds around them. Such a cloud modifies the dynamics of a coalescing black-hole binary, and the resulting gravitational waves may provide a new channel to detect light scalar fields, such as axion-like particles or wave-like dark matter candidates. In this work we simulate a series of black-hole mergers with mass ratios $q=1$ and $q=1/2$, immersed in an scalar field overdensity with masses in the range $M\mu_{\rm{S}} \in[0,1.0]$. To do so, we implemented a constraint-satisfying initial data solver based on the puncture method, we improved the accuracy of our open-source software Canuda to eighth order finite differences, and we reduced the initial orbital eccentricity. We investigate the impact of the scalar mass on the gravitational and scalar radiation. We find that binaries can undergo a delayed or an accelerated merger with respect to the vacuum. Our study highlights the challenge and importance of accurately modeling black-hole binaries in dark matter environments.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet entropy and thermal dynamics of RN-AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of a novel solution for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, uniquely incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications, this inclusion allows for a modified entropy formulation, facilitating the computation of key thermodynamic quantities such as Gibbs free energy, the first law of thermodynamics, the equation of state, and Hawking temperature. We identify critical points and graphically represent the relationship between temperature and Gibbs free energy as a function of the horizon radius. Ultimately, we assess the thermal stability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS black hole within the framework of Gauss-Bonnet gravity, emphasizing the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications. As a result, it is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling significantly alters the thermodynamic behavior and stability structure of the black hole, revealing richer phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <title>Emergent time and more from wavefunction collapse in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we further develop a recently proposed theory of time based on wavefunction collapse in general relativity. It is based on the postulations that quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints, represent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift generate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses toward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the scale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar, vector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of time for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit, the tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra modes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the constraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over all length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave vector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations with large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range interactions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them undetectable without sufficient temporal resolution. These are demonstrated for the cosmological constant-dominated universe through semi-classical and adiabatic approximations, which are controlled in the limit of large space dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory in Successive Rindler Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study successive Rindler-like transformations in Minkowski spacetime and the corresponding sequence of vacuum states perceived by observers restricted to respective wedges. Extending the standard Rindler construction to an $n$-fold iteration, we find via Bogoliubov transformations that the vacuum of the $(n-1)^{th}$ Rindler observer appears thermal to the $n^{th}$ one. The characteristic trajectories, confined to nested wedges, exhibit characteristic accelerations and horizon shifts depending on transformation parameters ${g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_{n}}$. For the second-level transformation (\emph{Rindler Rindler} case), the late time acceleration asymptotically approaches $2g_2$ for one branch and diverges for the other. We study Minkowski, Rindler, and Rindler Rindler vacuum states from the perspective of Unruh DeWitt (UDW) detectors along inertial, Rindler, and Rindler Rindler trajectories. The response of the UDW detector coupled to a real massless scalar field confirms the thermality: the transition rate of Rindler Rindler observer in Minkowski vacuum matches that of a standard Rindler detector with acceleration $2g_2$, yielding a Planckian spectrum at late times. The conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bound State Perturbations in the Interior of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit our earlier work and investigate the bound state perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The bound sates are defined as the perturbations in the interior of the black hole with an imaginary spectrum which are regular at the center of black hole while their time-dependent profile falls off exponentially on the event horizon. Using the scale factor in the expanding direction in the interior of the black hole as the clock, we rewrite the corresponding Regge-Wheeler equation and solve it semi-analytically as well as numerically. We confirm that the bound state solutions exist for scalar, vector and axial tensor perturbations. It is shown that for a given value of $\ell &gt;s$, there are total $\ell-s$ such bound states. We obtain the universal lower bound $2 G M \omega_I &gt;1$ for the spectrum of bound state which is asymptotically saturated in the large $\ell$ limit. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound on the spectrum of axial perturbations which for large $\ell$ scales like $2 G M \omega_I \lesssim 0.04\, \ell^4 $. As observed recently, these bound states have the curious property that the profile of the total wave function has a non-zero magnitude near the future event horizon.</description>

      <title>On the observation of cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Validation of NANOGrav 15-year data and ACT data by modified inflation in entropic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent evidences of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) through Pulsar Time Array (PTA) observations hint towards an alternative inflationary scenario, compared to the usual inflation, for describing the early stage of the universe in order to be compatible with the PTA data. Moreover, currently the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO) refines the constraint on inflationary observables, compared to the only-Planck 2018 measurements. In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues by incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual inflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor perturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency region. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where the entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy that is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for suitable representations. The constraints on the model parameters coming from the ACT data also fit the NANOGrav 15-year data (based on numerical analysis), which reveal the model's compatibility with both the ACT and the PTA data.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a charged spherically symmetric black hole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, some of us have obtained exact charged spherically symmetric black hole solutions within the framework of bumblebee gravity, where the Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the bumblebee field. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal modes of this black hole. We compute the quasinormal frequencies corresponding to the scalar perturbation and the gravito-electromagnetic coupled perturbation using both the continued fraction method and the asymptotic iteration method. A detailed comparison of the results obtained from the two approaches is presented to evaluate their accuracy and efficiency in this Lorentz-violating background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a framework requiring a well-defined event horizon and matter obeying the weak energy condition, we employ gravitational decoupling method to construct non-singular hairy black holes: spherically or axially symmetric. These solutions arise from a deformation of the Minkowski vacuum, where the maximum deformation can yield the Schwarzschild metric for the static case, and the Kerr geometry for the stationary case, respectively.</description>

      <title>Can a Dehnen-type dark matter halo affect the neutrino flavor oscillations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational weak lensing of neutrinos in the presence of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter halo is investigated. The event horizon structure is explored, and the existence of the BH is studied in two different slices of the parameter space. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the oscillation phase and transition probabilities for both radial and non-radial neutrino propagation. Finally, we use a two-flavor toy model, and numerically analyze how the dark matter halo parameters as density and scale radius, affect oscillation probabilities and examine the role of decoherence. The results show that the presence of a dark matter halo modifies the oscillation phase and damping factor, leading to measurable deviations from the standard Schwarzschild BH case. These findings suggest that neutrino oscillations could, in principle, serve as a probe for dark matter distributions around compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Pole inflation from extended metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inflation in the framework of extended metric-affine F(R) gravity, where all even-parity quadratic invariants of torsion and non-metricity are included in the Lagrangian alongside the F(R) term. The extended theory admits a scalar-tensor description with a non-canonical kinetic term featuring poles. As a result, the inflationary dynamics and predictions for observables of this model are insensitive to the specific form of F(R), since they are dominated by the structure of the poles (order and residue). We analyze both a simplified version analytically and the full eleven-parameter theory, and we classify the models based on whether they feature second-order poles, whether they are free from ghosts, and whether they predict a sufficiently small tensor-to-scalar ratio. By relaxing the ghost-free requirement to only exclude ghosts near the pole (where inflation occurs), we demonstrate that we can significantly enlarge the set of viable models. We thus show that extended metric-affine F(R) gravity can act as a robust framework for inflation, reproducing the attractor predictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>The global nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime with self-gravitating massive Dirac fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Einstein-Dirac system for a massive field, which describes the evolution of self-gravitating massive spinor fields, and we investigate the global evolution problem, when the initial data set is sufficiently close to data describing a spacelike, asymptotically Euclidean slice of the Minkowski spacetime. We establish the gauge-invariant nonlinear stability of such fields, namely the existence of a globally hyperbolic development, which remains asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime in future timelike, null, and spacelike directions. Previous results on this problem have been limited to the Einstein-Dirac system in the massless case. Our analysis follows the asymptotically hyperboloidal-Euclidean framework introduced by LeFloch and Y. Ma for the massive Klein-Gordon-Einstein system. The structure specific to spinor fields and the Dirac equation necessitates significantly new elements in the proof. In contrast with prior approaches, our treatment of spinor fields and the Dirac equation is gauge-invariant, relying on the formalism of Lorentz Clifford algebras, principal fiber bundles, etc. Our analysis is carried out with the metric expressed in light-bending wave coordinates, as we call them. This leads us to the study of a global existence problem for a system of wave equations with constraints and a Klein-Gordon-type equations. We derive L2 estimates for the Dirac equation and its coupling with the Einstein equations, along with $pointwise estimates. New Sobolev inequalities are proven for spinor fields in a gauge-invariant manner in the hyperboloidal-Euclidean foliation. The nonlinear coupling between the massive Dirac equation and the Einstein equations is investigated, and we establish a hierarchy of estimates, which distinguish between translations, rotations, and boosts.</description>

      <title>Radiating black holes in general relativity need not be singular</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that black holes necessarily contain a region where general relativity breaks down, due to the inevitable formation of either a curvature singularity or a Cauchy horizon. In this work we challenge this view by analyzing a charged spherically symmetric black hole formed through gravitational collapse and evaporating via Hawking radiation. We show that the electromagnetic repulsion and the violation of energy conditions due to the presence of Hawking radiation are be sufficient to avoid the formation of both a singularity and a Cauchy horizon. We argue that a similar mechanism may apply to astrophysical black holes in which the role of the electric charge is replaced by the angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Quantum black holes: inside and outside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a unitary description of an evaporating black hole, one usually chooses the time slices that cover only outside of the event horizon, which is mostly problem-free because the event horizon is not encountered. However, is there any justification for avoiding time slices that cover inside the event horizon? To answer the question, we investigate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, where the time slices can cover both inside and outside the event horizon. We find that one can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave function must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly suggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface that crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must keep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the event horizon. In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single coherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a superposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a horizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum macroscopic object. We provide a synthetic approach to understanding the information loss paradox from this perspective.</description>

      <title>Light Propagation in $\kappa$-Minkowski Space-Time: Gauge Ambiguities and Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theory on the $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time at the semiclassical approximation. We construct exact solutions of the deformed Maxwell equations in vacuum, describing localized signals propagating in a given direction. The propagation velocity appears to be arbitrary. We figure out that the wave packets with different values of the propagation velocity are related by noncommutative gauge transformations. Moreover, we show that spatial distances between particles are gauge-dependent as well. We explain how these two gauge dependencies compensate each other, recovering gauge invariance of measurement results. According to our analysis, the gauge ambiguity of the speed of light can be absorbed into a redefinition of the unit of length and, therefore, cannot be measured experimentally.</description>

      <title>Perturbations and Greybody Factors of AdS Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings Surrounded by Quintessence-like Field in NLED Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves and advances in black hole imaging have opened new opportunities to probe exotic physics in strong-field regimes. Building upon a recent black hole solution in Einstein gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and exotic matter sources-specifically a cloud of strings and a quintessence field--we study the perturbative dynamics, thermodynamic behavior, and quantum transmission characteristics in anti-de Sitter spacetime. The black hole, defined by its mass, nonlinear magnetic charge, string cloud, and quintessence parameters, exhibits modified spacetime geometry, horizon structure, Hawking temperature, and effective potentials governing field propagation. We derive Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations for massless scalar, electromagnetic, and fermionic perturbations, exploring how these sources jointly shape the potential barriers. The Hawking temperature shows strong dependence on the horizon radius and nonlinear charge, differing markedly from asymptotically flat cases due to the cosmological constant. Greybody factors, describing Hawking radiation transmission probabilities, are computed for all field spins via turning point analysis. A notable result arises in the fermionic sector: positive and negative helicity modes attain maximal transmission at distinct quintessence normalization values, revealing helicity-dependent coupling absent in bosonic channels. This asymmetry suggests a potential observational signature of spin-exotic matter interactions, offering new insights into detecting quintessence through black hole radiation spectra. Our results extend previous perturbative analyses by incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics, cosmic strings, and quintessence effects--linking quantum radiation studies to gravitational wave astronomy and early-universe cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three dimensional hyperbolic manifolds have accumulation points in the spectrum of their volumes, leading to a divergence in the sum over topologies. The limit points are cusped hyperbolic manifolds, and we propose to renormalize the sum by including the cusped manifold as a counterterm. This gives a reinterpretation of the zeta-function regularization procedure used by Maloney and Witten in the sum over SL(2,Z) black holes. For pure N = 1 supergravity, cusps with even spin structure can be used in a similar way. Cusps with odd spin structure are not needed to cancel any divergence, but they find an application by making the index nonzero.</description>

      <title>Covariant phase space and the semi-classical Einstein equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The covariant phase space formalism in general relativity is a covariant method for constructing the symplectic two-form, Hamiltonian and other conserved charges on the phase space of solutions to the Einstein equation with classical matter. In this note, we consider a generalization of this formalism to the semi-classical Einstein equation coupled to quantum matter. Given a family of solutions in semi-classical gravity, we define the semi-classical symplectic two-form -- a natural generalization of the classical sympelctic two-form -- as the sum of the gravitational symplectic form and the Berry curvature associated to the quantum state of matter. We show that the semi-classical symplectic two-form is independent of the Cauchy slice, and satisfies the quantum generalization of the classical Hollands-Iyer-Wald identity. For small perturbations, we also extend our discussion to gauge-invariantly defined subregions of spacetime, where the quantum contribution is replaced by the Berry curvature of certain special purifications involving the Connes cocycle. In the AdS/CFT context, the semi-classical symplectic form defined here is naturally dual to the Berry curvature in the boundary CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent arXiv post, Hawkins &amp; Garcia-Bellido raised doubts on the results of 20-yr long OGLE photometric monitoring, which did not find a large number of gravitational microlensing events in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds. These results implied that primordial black holes and other compact objects with masses from 10^{-8} to 10^3 M_solar cannot comprise a substantial fraction of the Milky Way dark matter halo. Unfortunately, the Hawkins &amp; Garcia-Bellido post contained a number of scientific misrepresentations of our work. Here, we demonstrate that their arguments lack a solid basis or are simply incorrect. As we show below, "and yet they are not found" - compact objects (including primordial black holes) in the dark halo of the Milky Way remain undetected, despite extensive searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An FLRW reduction of N=1 supergravity is troublesome since spatial isotropy prohibits a non-vanishing Rarita-Schwinger field. In view of this, we consider the quadratic form $\psi_m^{\ \alpha} \psi_{n \alpha}$ arising from a particular superspace generalization of the metric tensor. Imposing the FLRW form on this object reduces $\psi_m^{\ \alpha}$ to a single 2-component spinor $\phi^\alpha$, which becomes the superpartner of both the scale factor $a$ and lapse $N$, thus inducing the conformal time gauge, $N=a$. Time-reparametrization invariance is restored if we allow for deviations of FLRW form that are proportional to the gauge fields $N, \psi_0^{\ \alpha}$. We determine the allowed supergravity transformations that preserve the resulting FLRW supermultiplets.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and topological classifications of static non-extremal four-charge AdS black hole in the five-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$, $STU-W^2U$ gauged supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate thermodynamical aspects of a novel static non-extremal black hole solution in the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space carrying four independent electric charge parameters and with a negative cosmological constant, within the framework of $D=5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets specified by the pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. A central outcome of our work is the demonstration that the thermodynamics of this solution consistently satisfies both the differential and integral forms of the first law of black hole thermodynamics. When the fourth charge is set to zero, our configuration reduces to the known three-charge static non-extremal AdS$_5$ black hole within the gauged $STU$ model, and its thermodynamic behavior connects smoothly to that limit. Finally, we also provide a brief discussion about topological classifications of its thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Thermal Models for Test Masses in Next-Generation Gravitational Wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate thermal modeling of Terminal Test Masses (TTMs) is crucial for optimizing the sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometers like Virgo. In fact, in such gravitational wave detectors even minimal laser power absorption can induce performance-limiting thermal effects. This paper presents a detailed investigation into the steady-state thermal behavior of TTMs. In particular, future scenarios of increased intracavity laser beam power and optical coating absorption are considered. We develop and compare two numerical models: a comprehensive model incorporating volumetric heat absorption in both the multilayer coating and the bulk substrate, and a simplified reduced model where the coating's thermal impact is represented as an effective surface boundary condition on the substrate. Our simulations were focused on a ternary coating design, which is a candidate for use in next-generation detectors. Results reveal that higher coating absorption localizes peak temperatures near the coating--vacuum interface. Importantly, the comparative analysis demonstrates that temperature predictions from the reduced model differ from the detailed model by only milli-Kelvins, a discrepancy often within the experimental uncertainties of the system's thermo-physical parameters. This finding suggests that computationally efficient reduced models can provide sufficiently accurate results for thermal management and first-order distortion analyses. Moreover, the critical role of accurately characterizing the total power absorbed by the coating is emphasized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes exist all over our Universe, possessing a very wide range of masses. At the moment, they serve as a probe to test general relativity at astrophysical scales, but in the future they may also give us information about gravity at the microscale. Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties, such as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering black holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in statistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system, several questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be explained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these questions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored at the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this connection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved spacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged self-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of state which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes and self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase transitions between hot matter and black holes. We show the power of the formalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes. Namely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black holes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius. We construct ensembles of a self-gravitating matter thin shell, both in anti-de Sitter and in asymptotically flat spaces, in order to understand the thermodynamic features of the shell and the possible phase transitions to black hole configurations.</description>

      <title>Non-conservative Mass Transfer in the Neutron Star Stripping Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of long-term stable mass transfer (or stripping) in a close neutron star binary system is possible at a sufficiently large initial asymmetry of the component masses. At the final stage of the evolution of such systems, the low-mass neutron star fills its Roche lobe, whereupon its mass is gradually transferred to the more massive component. At a certain point, the stability of the mass transfer is lost, causing the minimum-mass neutron star to explode. In the present stripping calculations, the effect of non-conservative mass transfer has been taken into account for the first time, resulting in an increase in the duration of stable mass transfer from a few tenths of a second to a few seconds. This allows the time delay of 1.7 s between the loss of the gravitational-wave signal and the detection of the gamma-ray burst from the multimessenger event GW170817-GRB170817A to be naturally explained. The interaction of the envelope of the exploded minimum-mass neutron star with the matter ejected during non-conservative mass transfer may explain two episodes in the light curve of this gamma-ray burst.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally mediated entanglement of fermionic qubits: from static to dynamical limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the quantum Boltzmann equation to analyze the gravitationally generated entanglement between two remote qubits by considering two explicit microscopic models. A graviton propagator is employed as the mediator of the interactions, while the qubits are considered in a spatial superposition state. Such a setup, in the case of any entanglement generation, could potentially offer experimental evidence for the quantization of gravity. By treating the qubits as spin-1/2 particles in wave packets, we establish that the entanglement arises from forward scattering processes involving graviton exchanges. In our study, we consider both static and dynamical limits of the propagator and show that only in the dynamical limit such entangled states can be generated. We also show that for the microscopic model based on the fermion particles in the background of magnetic field, the amount of entanglement depends on the Larmor frequency of the qubits, rather than their masses. These effects are observed to diminish in both models as the wave packet size increases. Our findings sheds more light into the gravity mediated entanglement between two spin-1/2 particles.</description>

      <title>Naturalness of vanishing black-hole tides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a symmetry argument for the vanishing and non-renormalization of static Love numbers for spherically symmetric black holes at full nonlinear order in four-dimensional General Relativity. The symmetry is realized both in full GR and in the worldline EFT, allowing for a unified treatment and proving both vanishing and non-renormalization to all orders. This closes some loop-holes in previous arguments that neglected nonlinearities in the worldline EFT, and extends previous vanishing results to all nonlinear static tides. When extended to higher-dimensional gravity, these arguments also explain the pattern of vanishing and running static Love numbers of electric and tensor type, and predict new results at the nonlinear order. We also apply our findings to the tidal response of shift-symmetric scalar fields, predicting the vanishing of even order nonlinear static Love numbers and unifying these statements with the no-hair theorem (and its violations).</description>

      <title>Dynamical entropy of charged black objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for electromagnetic potential-charge contributions to the first law of black hole mechanics, applicable to dynamical first-order perturbations of stationary black objects with possibly non-compact bifurcate Killing horizons. Working in the covariant phase space formalism, we derive both comparison and physical process versions of the first law. We consider generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity in $D$ spacetime dimensions, containing non-minimally coupled abelian $p$-form gauge fields. The pullback of the gauge field to the horizon is allowed to diverge while its field strength remains smooth, yielding gauge-invariant electric potential-charge pairs in the first law. We further extend the construction to include magnetic charges by developing a bundle-covariant, gauge-invariant prescription that fixes the Jacobson-Kang-Myers ambiguity in the improved Noether charge. Electric and magnetic charges are, respectively, associated with non-trivial $(D - p - 1)$- and $(p + 1)$-cycles of the horizon cross-section, whose homology classes determine the number of independent potential-charge pairs through the Betti numbers $b_{D - p - 1}$ and $b_{p + 1}$. Further, the dynamical gravitational entropy entering the first law is identified with the gauge-invariant part of the improved Noether charge, giving a gauge-invariant extension of the recent proposal by Hollands, Wald and Zhang. We illustrate our framework with dyonic AdS black holes, dipole black rings, and charged black branes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing of Gravitational Frame-Dragging with a Superfluid $^4$He Gyrometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a laboratory-scale experiment to locally measure the general relativistic frame-dragging effect on Earth using the macroscopic quantum properties of a novel superfluid $^4$He single Josephson junction gyrometer. We derive the frame-dragging and related geodetic and Thomas effects in the superfluid gyrometer and present a procedure for their experimental measurement. We compute the expected thermal noise floor and find that very high sensitivity can be expected at millikelvin temperatures, where near-future Josephson junctions using nanoporous 2D materials are expected to operate. Assuming utilization of the lowest mechanical loss materials, we find a noise spectral density of $5\times 10^{-17}$ rads/s/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 mK, which is sufficient to resolve the frame-dragging rate to 0.2% within one second of measurement, giving a rotational sensitivity of 1 revolution in 4 Byrs. This extreme sensitivity to rotation corresponds to a measurement of proper time differences as small as $10^{-35}$ s.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant method for maximum simplification of the field strength in non-Abelian Yang-Mills theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:1306.2174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new local gauge invariant method is introduced in order to maximally simplify the expression for a SU(2) non-Abelian field strength. The new tetrads introduced in previous works are going to play a fundamental role in the algorithm presented in this manuscript. Three new local gauge invariant objects are going to guide us through the process of making a field strength block diagonal. The process is also covariant. Any non-trivial isospace field strength projection will become block diagonal through this gauge invariant algorithm. As an application we will find new local observables in Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>Broader view of bimetric MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All existing treatments of bimetric MOND (BIMOND) -- a class of relativistic versions of MOND -- have dealt with a rather restricted sub-class: The Lagrangian of the interaction between the gravitational degrees of freedom -- the two metrics -- is a function of a certain {\it single} scalar argument built from the difference in connections of the two metrics. I show that the scope of BIMOND is much richer: The two metrics can couple through several scalars to give theories that all have a "good" nonrelativistic (NR) limit -- one that accounts correctly, a-la MOND, for the dynamics of galactic systems, {\it including gravitational lensing}. This extended-BIMOND framework exhibits a qualitative departure from the way we think of MOND at present, as encapsulated, in all its aspects, by one "interpolating function" of one acceleration variable. After deriving the general field equations, I pinpoint the subclass of theories that satisfy the pivotal requirement of a good NR limit. These involve three independent, quadratic scalar variables. In the NR limit these scalars all reduce to the same acceleration scalar, and the NR theory then does hinge on one function of a {\it a single} acceleration variable -- representing the NR MOND "interpolating function", whose form is largely dictated by the observed NR galactic dynamics. However, these scalars behave differently, in different relativistic contexts. So, the full richness of the multi-variable Lagrangian, as it enters cosmology, for example, is hardly informed by what we learn from observations of galactic dynamics. In this paper, I present the formalism, with some generic examples. I also consider some cosmological solutions where the two metrics are small departures from one Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric. This may offer a framework for describing cosmology within the extended BIMOND.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a set of spacetime solutions whose rotation curves approach a flat profile at large radii, as observed for spiral galaxies. The associated stress-energy tensor reflects a positive mass and anisotropic pressure. The spatially averaged equation of state, which parametrizes these infinity of solutions, exhibits a lower bound: $w&gt; -\frac{1}{3}$. As examples, we present the spacetime metrics for non-ideal `dust' and `radiation'. The Einstein clusters emerge as another special class, whose EOS parameter is predicted to be given by the limiting rotational velocity as: $w=\frac{v^2}{3c^2}$. Analyzing the gravitational deflection of a light ray penetrating a large halo, we find the correction to the Einsteinian bending angle to be $\Big(\frac{2+3w}{1+3w}\Big)\pi \frac{v^2}{c^2}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the consistency between bulk and boundary causalities in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. We derive a general formula that provides sufficient conditions for time advance, where bulk propagation arrives earlier than any boundary propagation. As an application, we show that in Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m--anti de Sitter spacetime, no geodesic satisfies the sufficient conditions for time advance even in the super-extremal case. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg theory exhibits time advance when one or a linear combination of the coupling constants is positive and below an upper bound determined by the AdS length scale.</description>

      <title>A density-responsive scalar-field framework for singularity regularization and dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a covariant scalar-field framework that unifies the space-time singularity regularization with dynamical dark energy. The theory extends general relativity by introducing a scalar field $\Phi$ whose potential couples to the Lorentz-invariant quantity $X \equiv u_{\alpha} u_{\beta} T^{\alpha\beta}_{\mathrm{matter}}$, ensuring manifest covariance. The resulting density-responsive scalar energy $\rho_\Phi$ exhibits dual behavior: (i) in high-density regimes, it saturates at $\rho_\Phi \leq AM_P^4/2$, providing a Planck-scale upper bound on the total energy density that regularizes classical singularities; (ii) in low-density regimes, it approaches a constant $\rho_\Phi \to AM_U^4$, driving cosmic acceleration as dynamical dark energy. A natural renormalization group evolution with an anomalous dimension $\gamma \approx 0.501$ connects the Planck scale to the meV dark energy scale without fine-tuning. The model makes distinctive, testable predictions: $w_0 \approx -0.99$ and $w_a \approx +0.03$, where the positive $w_a$ distinguishes it from $\Lambda$CDM and standard quintessence models. Despite the novel interaction terms, the fifth forces are suppressed by $\beta_{\rm eff} \propto 1/\rho_m^2$, yielding factors below $10^{-58}$ in laboratory environments, and ensuring compatibility with all precision gravity tests. This framework demonstrates how a single quantum field theory mechanism can simultaneously address UV singularities and IR dark energy, providing concrete predictions for future Stage-IV cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from inspiraling compact binaries in quadratic gravity and their parameterized post-Einstein characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational waveforms from the inspiral phase of compact binary systems within the framework of quadratic gravity and map their deviations from general relativity into the parameterized post-Einstein (PPE) formalism to constrain the theory parameters. Quadratic gravity generically includes a massive spin-2 ghost, which leads to ill-defined energy and angular momentum fluxes. Following earlier proposals, we remove these unphysical features by imposing a constraint on the massive spin-2 mode, restricting it to propagate only the same polarizations of general relativity. Within the quadrupole approximation, we derive the radiative degrees of freedom, including massless and massive tensor modes, as well as a massive scalar field. Using the stationary phase approximation, we compute the Fourier-domain waveform of the massless tensor modes and extract the phase corrections. For small deviations from general relativity, we show that both the scalar and massive tensor modes can be consistently embedded into the PPE framework, extending previous results that considered only scalar fields. We derive updated constraints on the parameters of quadratic gravity, finding bounds improved by several orders of magnitude compared to existing limits. Finally, we present forecasts for the sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope to these deviations.</description>

      <title>Scalarized neutron stars with a highly relativistic core in scalar-tensor gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact stars in scalar-tensor (ST) gravity have been extensively investigated, but relatively few studies have focused on highly relativistic neutron stars (NSs) with an extremely dense core region where the trace of the energy-momentum tensor reverses its sign. In this regime, we identify the origin of the phenomenon where {\it multiple} scalarized solutions exist for a {\it fixed} central density, arising from the oscillatory profile of the scalar field inside the star. This origin further indicates that the multi-branch structure emerges for both negative and positive $\beta$, the quadratic-term coefficient in the effective coupling function between the scalar field and conventional matter in the Einstein frame. By comparing the Damour--Esposito-Far\`ese and Mendes-Ortiz models of the ST gravity, we demonstrate that their distinct scalarization behaviors stem from whether the effective coupling function is bounded. We also compute for scalarized NSs with a highly relativistic dense core in ST theories the moment of inertia and tidal deformability that are relevant to pulsar-timing and gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical gravitational collapse offers a unique window into regimes of arbitrarily high curvature, culminating in a naked singularity arising from smooth initial data -- thus providing a dynamical counterexample to weak cosmic censorship. Near the critical regime, quantum effects from the collapsing matter are expected to intervene before full quantum gravity resolves the singularity. Despite its fundamental significance, a self-consistent treatment has so far remained elusive. In this work, we perform a one-loop semiclassical analysis using the robust anomaly-based method in the canonical setup of Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a free, massless scalar field. Focusing on explicitly solvable critical solutions in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, we analytically solve the semiclassical Einstein equations and provide definitive answers to several long-standing questions. We find that regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like quantum state, encoding genuine vacuum polarization effects from the collapsing matter. Remarkably, the resulting quantum corrections manifest as a growing mode. Horizon-tracing analyses, incorporating both classical and quantum modes, reveal the emergence of a finite mass gap, signaling a phase transition from classical Type II to quantum-modified Type I behavior, thereby providing a quantum enforcement of the weak cosmic censorship. The most nontrivial aspect of our analysis involves dealing with non-conformal matter fields in explicitly time-dependent critical spacetimes. Along the way, we uncover intriguing and previously underexplored features of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical critical collapse yields naked singularities from smooth initial data, challenging cosmic censorship and shaping the spectrum of primordial black holes. We show that one-loop vacuum polarization near the threshold alters this outcome. In analytically tractable Einstein-scalar critical spacetimes, regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like state whose stress tensor supplies a universal quantum growing mode. Its backreaction competes with the classical unstable mode, producing a shift of the critical point and a finite mass gap at the new threshold, thereby enforcing horizon formation even under arbitrary fine-tuning. In primordial collapse, the threshold shift enters exponentially into the formation fraction, while the gap truncates the low-mass tail -- effects that may reshape the predicted mass spectrum. These results provide the first consistent quantum treatment of critical collapse, offering definitive predictions for several long-standing problems.</description>

      <title>The Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields on radiative asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a large class of asymptotically flat spacetimes which includes radiative perturbations of Minkowski space, we define a distinguished global Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields by means of the microlocal approach to non-elliptic Fredholm theory, working in the de,sc-pseudodifferential algebra due to Sussman. We extend the limiting absorption principle (the "$i\varepsilon$ prescription" for the Feynman propagator) to this setting. Motivated by the complicated Hamilton flow structure arising in this problem, we also prove a new localized radial point estimate in the spirit of Haber-Vasy which, under appropriate nondegeneracy assumptions, allows one to propagate microlocal regularity into a single radial point belonging to a larger radial set which can be a source, sink, or saddle for the Hamilton flow.</description>

      <title>Unified Dark Matter and Dark Energy in a model of Non-Canonical Scalar-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of non-canonical scalar-tensor theory in which the kinetic term in the Brans-Dicke action is replaced by a non-canonical scalar field Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(X, \phi)= \lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta - V(\phi)$ where $X = (1/2) \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial^{\mu} \phi$ and $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\lambda$ are parameters of the model. This can be considered as a simple non-canonical generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory with a potential term which corresponds to a special case of this model with the values of the parameter $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1$ and $\lambda = 2w_{_{BD}}$ where $w_{_{BD}}$ is the Brans-Dicke parameter. Considering a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with scale factor $a(t)$, it is shown that, in the matter free Universe, the kinetic term $\lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta$ can lead to a power law solution $a(t)\propto t^{n}$ but the maximum possible value of $n$ turns out to be $(1+\sqrt{3})/4 \approx 0.683$. When $\alpha \geq 18$, this model can lead to a solution $a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$, thereby mimicking the evolution of scale factor in a cold dark matter dominated epoch with Einstein's General Relativity (GR). With the addition of a linear potential term $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi$, it is shown that this model mimics the standard $\Lambda$CDM model type evolution of the Universe. The larger the value of $\alpha$, the closer the evolution of $a(t)$ in this model to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model based on Einstein's GR. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this model with a linear potential can mimic the GR based $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with an appropriate choice of the potential $V(\phi)$, this model can provide a unified description of both dark matter and dynamical dark energy, as if it were based on Einstein's GR.</description>

      <title>Exponential Suppression of the Unruh Effect and Geometric Enhancement in a Fermionic Cavity QED Setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Unruh effect--the prediction that an accelerated observer perceives the vacuum as a thermal bath--remains one of the most profound yet experimentally unverified consequences of quantum field theory. This work analyzes a model for the decay of an excited state within a uniformly accelerated cavity to address the historical null results and to identify an alternative, non-thermal signature. In our framework, a massless Dirac field confined to a cavity is coupled to an external massive Dirac field of mass $M$. Our analysis reveals that for fundamental fermions (such as the electron), the condition $Mc^2 \gg \hbar a/c$ is satisfied at all achievable accelerations, placing the system in a regime of exponential suppression, $\Gamma_{\text{acc}}/\Gamma_{\text{in}} \sim \exp(-2 M c^2 / (\hbar a/c))$ (with $\Gamma_{\text{in}}$ the inertial decay rate). This suppression holds universally across all cavity sizes and experimental designs, providing a potential explanation within this model for the non-observation of Unruh effects. Furthermore, for intermediate-sized cavities ($a l \sim c^2$) with light external fields ($Mc^2 \ll \hbar a/c$), the model predicts a geometric enhancement of the decay rate, scaling as $\Gamma_{\text{acc}}/\Gamma_{\text{in}} \sim \frac{a l/c^2}{\ln(1 + a l/c^2)}$, which arises from kinematic constraints rather than thermal stimulation. This enhancement, reaching up to 26% for realistic parameters ($a\sim 10^{20}$ m/s$^2$, $l\sim 500~\mu$m), is presented as a measurable signature accessible through quantum simulation platforms. Our results propose a unified framework that explains past experimental challenges and suggests a viable path forward for detecting non-inertial quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds May Significantly Limit the Use of Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many scalars, minimally coupled to only gravity, that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints. We also mention further constraints from Hawking radiation from black holes.</description>

      <title>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times.
  Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</description>

      <title>The canonical ensemble of a self-gravitating matter thin shell in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.</description>

Abstract: We define the notion of Weyl anomalies, measuring the violation of local scale invariance, in interacting quantum field theory on curved spacetimes in the framework of locally covariant field theory. We discuss some general properties of Weyl anomalies, such as their relation to the trace anomaly. We give a criterion for a theory to be conformal at the quantum level, and show that even for a conformal theory Weyl transformations in general obtain quantum corrections. We study the trace anomaly in detail for the $\phi^4$ theory, in particular determining it up to second order in the interaction. We also show that at third order in the interaction a potential $\Box \phi^2$ term can be removed by finite renormalization.</description>

      <title>Recoherence, adiabaticity, and Markovianity in Gaussian maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of situations where cosmological fluctuations recohere during inflation, we investigate the relationship between quantum recoherence (late-time purification after a transient phase of decoherence), adiabaticity, and Markovianity. To that end, we study a simple setup of two linearly-coupled harmonic oscillators, and compute the purity of one oscillator when the interaction is switched off. We find that there exists a critical value for the coupling strength below which the purity oscillates and above which it decays exponentially. This decay cannot be captured by perturbation theory; hence, decoherence is always a non-perturbative phenomenon. When the interaction is turned off, the purity either freezes to its value prior to the turn-off, or it smoothly goes back to a value very close to one (recoherence). This depends on the rate at which the turn-off occurs. We thus develop a new adiabatic-expansion scheme and find complete recoherence at any finite order in the inverse turn-off time. Therefore, decoherence is always a non-adiabatic effect. The critical value of the turn-off time above which recoherence takes place is then expressed in terms of the other time scales of the problem. Finally, we show that the dynamics of the system is never Markovian, even when decoherence takes place. We introduce a new measure of Markovianity dubbed the Bures velocity and use it to optimise Markovian approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Fragmentation of the QCD Axion on the Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic misalignment, one of the most compelling scenarios for the non-thermal generation of axion dark matter, is generally accompanied by axion fragmentation, a process in which the energy of the axion condensate is transferred to its perturbations. The dynamics of fragmentation, at least in the context of dark matter production, have so far been studied semi-analytically using perturbation theory. In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.</description>

Abstract: Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Algebra structure of conformal Killing-Yano forms in geometries with skew-symmetric torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05117</link>

Abstract: We consider conformal Killing-Yano forms corresponding to the antisymmetric generalizations of conformal Killing vectors to higher degree forms in the presence of skew-symmetric torsion. Integrability conditions for torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms are found and a graded Lie bracket for conformal Killing-Yano forms to constitute a graded Lie algebra structure is proposed. It is found that a graded Lie algebra structure for a special subset of torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms can be constructed for a closed and parallel skew-symmetric torsion on constant curvature and Einstein manifolds. Similar structure for generalized hidden symmetries defined from generalized connection in generalized geometry is also constructed.</description>

      <title>On Pre-Inflationary non Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the three-point amplitude of curvature perturbations in scenarios suggested by high-scale supersymmetry breaking in String Theory, where the inflaton is forced to climb a steep exponential potential. We can do it at the price of some simplifications, and more importantly with some assumptions on the softening effects of String Theory. These suggest a scenario proposed long ago by Gasperini and Veneziano, where the initial singularity is replaced by a bounce, and the resulting analysis rests on a scale $\Delta$ that leaves some signs in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. The amplitude comprises two types of contribution: the first oscillates around the original result of Maldacena and gives no further prospects to detect a non-Gaussian signal, but the second, which is subtly tied to the turning point at the end of the climbing phase, within the window 62&lt;N&lt;66 for the inflationary e-folds could be compatible with Planck constraints and potentially observable. The amplitudes involving the tensor modes contain only the first type of contribution.</description>
