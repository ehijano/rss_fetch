      <title>Complexity of two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and phase transition of decagonal quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the nucleation of quasicrystals from liquid or periodic crystals by developing an efficient order-order phase transition algorithm, namely the nullspace-preserving saddle search method. Specifically, we focus on nucleation and phase transitions of the decagonal quasicrystal (DQC) based on the Lifshitz-Petrich model. We present the nucleation path of DQC from the liquid and demonstrate one- and two-stage transition paths between DQC and periodic crystals. We provide a perspective of the group-subgroup phase transition and nucleation rates to understand the nucleation and phase transition mechanisms involving DQC. These results reveal the one-step and stepwise modes of symmetry breaking or recovery in the phase transition from DQC, where the stepwise modes are more probable.</description>

      <title>Analytic method for quadratic polarons in nonparabolic bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Including the effect of lattice anharmonicity on electron-phonon interactions has recently garnered attention due to its role as a necessary and significant component in explaining various phenomena, including superconductivity, optical response, and temperature dependence of mobility. This study focuses on analytically treating the effects of anharmonic electron-phonon coupling on the polaron self-energy, combined with numerical Diagrammatic Monte Carlo data. Specifically, we incorporate a quadratic interaction into the method of squeezed phonon states, which has proven effective for analytically calculating the polaron parameters. Additionally, we extend this method to nonparabolic finite-width conduction bands while maintaining the periodic translation symmetry of the system. Our results are compared with those obtained from Diagrammatic Monte Carlo, partially reported in a recent study [S. Ragni et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, L121109(2023)], covering a wide range of coupling strengths for the nonlinear interaction. Remarkably, our analytic method predicts the same features as the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulation.</description>
