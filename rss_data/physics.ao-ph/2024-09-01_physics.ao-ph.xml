      <title>Uncertainty-aware segmentation for rainfall prediction post processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasts are crucial for applications such as flood management, agricultural planning, water resource allocation, and weather warnings. Despite advances in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, they still exhibit significant biases and uncertainties, especially at high spatial and temporal resolutions. To address these limitations, we explore uncertainty-aware deep learning models for post-processing daily cumulative quantitative precipitation forecasts to obtain forecast uncertainties that lead to a better trade-off between accuracy and reliability. Our study compares different state-of-the-art models, and we propose a variant of the well-known SDE-Net, called SDE U-Net, tailored to segmentation problems like ours. We evaluate its performance for both typical and intense precipitation events.
  Our results show that all deep learning models significantly outperform the average baseline NWP solution, with our implementation of the SDE U-Net showing the best trade-off between accuracy and reliability. Integrating these models, which account for uncertainty, into operational forecasting systems can improve decision-making and preparedness for weather-related events.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Stability of Partially and Fully Saturated Atmospheres to Moist Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a linear analysis of a minimal model of moist convection under a variety of atmospheric conditions. The stationary solutions that we analyze include both fully saturated and partially unsaturated atmospheres in both unconditionally and conditionally unstable cases. We find that all of the solutions we consider are linearly unstable via exchange of stability when sufficiently driven. The critical Rayleigh numbers vary by over an order of magnitude between unconditionally unstable and conditionally unstable atmospheres. The unsaturated atmospheres are notable for the presence of linear gravity wave-like oscillations even in unstable conditions. We study their eigenfunction structure and find that the buoyancy and moisture perturbations are anticorrelated in $z$, such that regions of negative buoyancy have positive moisture content. We suggest that these features in unsaturated atmospheres may explain the phenomenon of gravity wave shedding by moist convective plumes.</description>

      <title>Polar Jet Stream Fluctuations in an Energy Balance Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.03095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of increased longwave radiative forcing (a proxy for increased greenhouse gas concentration) on the zonally averaged location of the eddy-driven jet stream in a latitude dependent, two-layer Energy Balance Model. The model includes separate terms for atmospheric and surface albedos, and takes into account reflections of shortwave radiation between the surface and atmospheric layers. We introduce the notion of a cloud factor function, which depends on temperature gradients, to simulate the eddy-driven jet. An increase in longwave radiative forcing initially results in a poleward movement of the jet stream's mean latitude, but as the forcing increases, the location of the jet stream becomes quasi-periodic and its mean location moves equatorward.</description>
