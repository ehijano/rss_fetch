      <title>Production planning in 3DPrinting factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production planning in 3D printing factories brings new challenges among which the scheduling of parts to be produced stands out. A main issue is to increase the efficiency of the plant and 3D printers productivity. Planning, scheduling, and nesting in 3D printing are recurrent problems in the search for new techniques to promote the development of this technology. In this work, we address the problem for the suppliers that have to schedule their daily production. This problem is part of the LONJA3D model, a managed 3D printing market where the parts ordered by the customers are reorganized into new batches so that suppliers can optimize their production capacity. In this paper, we propose a method derived from the design of combinatorial auctions to solve the nesting problem in 3D printing. First, we propose the use of a heuristic to create potential manufacturing batches. Then, we compute the expected return for each batch. The selected batch should generate the highest income. Several experiments have been tested to validate the process. This method is a first approach to the planning problem in 3D printing and further research is proposed to improve the procedure</description>

      <title>The test of investors' behavioral bias through the price discovery process in cryptoasset exchange" Transactional-level evidence from Thailand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing investors' trading behavior in cryptoasset markets provides new evidence supporting the theory that retail investors likely exhibit behavioral biases. We investigate the price discovery process between Thailand's most highly liquid exchange and the global exchange. Under the no-arbitrage assumption, bid-offer quotes in the local exchange should quickly move to match the new price levels in the global exchange, as the price process of cryptoassets in the local exchange does not contain new information that can lead the price dynamic in the global exchange. We analyze intraday bid-offer quotes and investors' portfolio positions and find that investors exhibit the disposition effect by attempting to sell their profitable positions during market upturns. The rate of bid-offer movement is significantly slow to match a new global price level only in situations when most investors in the market are in profit. These insights are crucial as they suggest that the risk-return characteristics of asset prices between the bull and bear market may differ, resulting from investors' behavioral biases.</description>

      <title>Censorship in Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of propaganda, misinformation, and biased narratives from autocratic regimes, especially on social media, is a growing concern in many democracies. Can censorship be an effective tool to curb the spread of such slanted narratives? In this paper, we study the European Union's ban on Russian state-led news outlets after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. We analyze 775,616 tweets from 133,276 users on Twitter/X, employing a difference-in-differences strategy. We show that the ban reduced pro-Russian slant among users who had previously directly interacted with banned outlets. The impact is most pronounced among users with the highest pre-ban slant levels. However, this effect was short-lived, with slant returning to its pre-ban levels within two weeks post-enforcement. Additionally, we find a detectable albeit less pronounced indirect effect on users who had not directly interacted with the outlets before the ban. We provide evidence that other suppliers of propaganda may have actively sought to mitigate the ban's influence by intensifying their activity, effectively counteracting the persistence and reach of the ban.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Stocks on Correlations between Crop Yields and Prices and on Revenue Insurance Premiums using Semiparametric Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crop yields and harvest prices are often considered to be negatively correlated, thus acting as a natural risk management hedge through stabilizing revenues. Storage theory gives reason to believe that the correlation is an increasing function of stocks carried over from previous years. Stock-conditioned second moments have implications for price movements during shortages and for hedging needs, while spatially varying yield-price correlation structures have implications for who benefits from commodity support policies. In this paper, we propose to use semi-parametric quantile regression (SQR) with penalized B-splines to estimate a stock-conditioned joint distribution of yield and price. The proposed method, validated through a comprehensive simulation study, enables sampling from the true joint distribution using SQR. Then it is applied to approximate stock-conditioned correlation and revenue insurance premium for both corn and soybeans in the United States. For both crops, Cornbelt core regions have more negative correlations than do peripheral regions. We find strong evidence that correlation becomes less negative as stocks increase. We also show that conditioning on stocks is important when calculating actuarially fair revenue insurance premiums. In particular, revenue insurance premiums in the Cornbelt core will be biased upward if the model for calculating premiums does not allow correlation to vary with stocks available. The stock-dependent correlation can be viewed as a form of tail dependence that, if unacknowledged, leads to mispricing of revenue insurance products.</description>

      <title>Long-term Effects of India's Childhood Immunization Program on Earnings and Consumption Expenditure: Comment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Summan, Nandi, and Bloom (2023), hereafter SNB, find that exposure during infancy to India's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) increased wages and per-capita household expenditure in early adulthood. SNB regress these outcomes on a treatment indicator that depends upon year and district of birth while controlling for age at follow-up. Because year of birth and age are nearly collinear, SNB's identifying variation does not come from the staggered introduction of the UIP, but rather from the progression of time during the follow-up period. Within the 12-month follow-up period, those interviewed later were more likely to have been treated and, on average, reported higher wages and household expenditure. Wages and household expenditure, however, rose by at least as much in a control group composed of people too old to have been exposed as infants to the UIP as in the treated group. SNB's results are best explained by inflation, economic growth, and non-random survey sequencing during the follow-up survey period.</description>

      <title>Entangled vs. Separable Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate joint probabilistic choice rules describing the behavior of two decision makers, each facing potentially distinct menus. These rules are separable when they can be decomposed into individual choices correlated solely through their respective probabilistic choice rules. Despite its significant interest for the study of peer effects, influence, and taste variation, a complete characterization of these rules has remained elusive (Chambers, Masatlioglu, and Turansick, 2021). We fully characterize separable choices through a finite system of inequalities inspired by Afriat's theorem. Our results address the possibility of entangled choices, where decision makers behave as if they do not communicate, yet their choices are not separable. More generally, we establish that separable joint choice restrictions can be factored into individual choice restrictions if only if at least one decision maker's probabilistic choice rule uniquely identifies the distribution over deterministic choice rules. The no communication condition and the individual restrictions are no longer sufficient in the absence of this uniqueness. Our results offer robust tools for distinguishing between separable decision-making and behaviors beyond mere peer effects such as imitation and cheating.</description>
