      <title>Wigner distribution, Wigner entropy, and Anomalous Transport of a Generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} model with tunable quasidisordered potentials. The model has an invariable mobility edge that separates the extended states from the localized states. At the mobility edge, the wave function presents critical characteristics, which can be verified by finite-size scaling analysis. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the extended, critical, and localized states can be effectively distinguished via their phase space representation, specially the Wigner distribution. Based on the Wigner distribution function, we can further obtain the corresponding Wigner entropy and employ the feature that the critical state has the maximum Wigner entropy to locate the invariable mobility edge. Finally, we reveal that there are anomalous transport phenomena between the transition from ballistic transport to the absence of diffusion.</description>

      <title>Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03829v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, a novel generalized mean-field approximation for epidemic inference and risk assessment within a fully Bayesian framework. SCDC accounts for non-causal effects of observations and uses a graphical model representation of epidemic processes to derive self-consistent equations for edge probability marginals. A small-coupling expansion yields time-dependent cavity messages capturing individual infection probabilities and observational conditioning. With linear computational cost per iteration in the epidemic duration, SCDC is particularly efficient and valid even for recurrent epidemic processes, where standard methods are exponentially complex. Tested on synthetic networks, it matches Belief Propagation in accuracy and outperforms individual-based mean-field methods. Notably, despite being derived as a small-infectiousness expansion, SCDC maintains good accuracy even for relatively large infection probabilities. While convergence issues may arise on graphs with long-range correlations, SCDC reliably estimates risk. Future extensions include non-Markovian models and higher-order terms in the dynamic cavity framework.</description>

      <title>Physical networks become what they learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical networks can develop diverse responses, or functions, by design, evolution or learning. We focus on electrical networks of nodes connected by resistive edges. Such networks can learn by adapting edge conductances to lower a cost function that penalizes deviations from a desired response. The network must also satisfy Kirchhoff's law, balancing currents at nodes, or, equivalently, minimizing total power dissipation by adjusting node voltages. The adaptation is thus a double optimization process, in which a cost function is minimized with respect to conductances, while dissipated power is minimized with respect to node voltages. Here we study how this physical adaptation couples the cost landscape, the landscape of the cost function in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, to the physical landscape, the dissipated power in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. We show how adaptation links the physical and cost Hessian matrices, suggesting that the physical response of networks to perturbations holds significant information about the functions to which they are adapted.</description>

      <title>Instability of the ferromagnetic phase under random fields in an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that the ferromagnetic phase remains stable under random magnetic fields in three and higher dimensions for the ferromagnetic Ising model and the Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses without correlation in the disorder variables. In this study, we investigate an Ising spin glass with correlated disorder and demonstrate that the ferromagnetic phase becomes unstable under random fields in any dimension, provided that magnetic field chaos exists in the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice. Additionally, we show that this instability can also be attributed to disorder (bond) chaos. We further argue that the model with correlated disorder remains in the ferromagnetic phase even in the presence of symmetry-breaking fields, as long as the Edwards-Anderson model on the same lattice exhibits a spin glass phase under a magnetic field. These results underscore the profound impact of spatial correlations in the disorder.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel pattern reconstruction through $L$-directional associative memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $L$-directional associative memories, composed of $L$ Hopfield networks, displaying imitative Hebbian intra-network interactions and anti-imitative Hebbian inter-network interactions, where couplings are built over a set of hidden binary patterns. We evaluate the model's performance in reconstructing the whole set of hidden binary patterns when provided with mixtures of noisy versions of these patterns. Our numerical results demonstrate the model's high effectiveness in the reconstruction task for structureless and structured datasets.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Laws of Absorbing Phase Transitions in Artificial Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that conventional artificial deep neural networks operating near the phase boundary of the signal propagation dynamics, also known as the edge of chaos, exhibit universal scaling laws of absorbing phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We exploit the fully deterministic nature of the propagation dynamics to elucidate an analogy between a signal collapse in the neural networks and an absorbing state (a state that the system can enter but cannot escape from). Our numerical results indicate that the multilayer perceptrons and the convolutional neural networks belong to the mean-field and the directed percolation universality classes, respectively. Also, the finite-size scaling is successfully applied, suggesting a potential connection to the depth-width trade-off in deep learning. Furthermore, our analysis of the training dynamics under the gradient descent reveals that hyperparameter tuning to the phase boundary is necessary but insufficient for achieving optimal generalization in deep networks. Remarkably, nonuniversal metric factors associated with the scaling laws are shown to play a significant role in concretizing the above observations. These findings highlight the usefulness of the notion of criticality for analyzing the behavior of artificial deep neural networks and offer new insights toward a unified understanding of the essential relationship between criticality and intelligence.</description>

      <title>Transformer Wave Function for two dimensional frustrated magnets: emergence of a Spin-Liquid Phase in the Shastry-Sutherland Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16889v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum magnetism in two-dimensional systems represents a lively branch in modern condensed-matter physics. In the presence of competing super-exchange couplings, magnetic order is frustrated and can be suppressed down to zero temperature. Still, capturing the correct nature of the exact ground state is a highly complicated task, since energy gaps in the spectrum may be very small and states with different physical properties may have competing energies. Here, we introduce a variational Ansatz for two-dimensional frustrated magnets by leveraging the power of representation learning. The key idea is to use a particular deep neural network with real-valued parameters, a so-called Transformer, to map physical spin configurations into a high-dimensional feature space. Within this abstract space, the determination of the ground-state properties is simplified and requires only a shallow output layer with complex-valued parameters. We illustrate the efficacy of this variational Ansatz by studying the ground-state phase diagram of the Shastry-Sutherland model, which captures the low-temperature behavior of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ with its intriguing properties. With highly accurate numerical simulations, we provide strong evidence for the stabilization of a spin-liquid between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic phases. In addition, a direct calculation of the triplet excitation at the $\Gamma$ point provides compelling evidence for a gapless spin liquid. Our findings underscore the potential of Neural-Network Quantum States as a valuable tool for probing uncharted phases of matter, and open up new possibilities for establishing the properties of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent weight morphologies in deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether deep neural networks can exhibit emergent behaviour is not only relevant for understanding how deep learning works, it is also pivotal for estimating potential security risks of increasingly capable artificial intelligence systems. Here, we show that training deep neural networks gives rise to emergent weight morphologies independent of the training data. Specifically, in analogy to condensed matter physics, we derive a theory that predict that the homogeneous state of deep neural networks is unstable in a way that leads to the emergence of periodic channel structures. We verified these structures by performing numerical experiments on a variety of data sets. Our work demonstrates emergence in the training of deep neural networks, which impacts the achievable performance of deep neural networks.</description>
