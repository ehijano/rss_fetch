      <title>Approaching the Lower Temporal Limit of Laser-Produced Plasma Sources for Table-Top Soft X-ray NEXAFS Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements for understanding dynamics in molecular and material systems has led to many advances in table-top sources for pulsed X-rays. We report on a table top laser-produced plasma (LPP) source that can perform soft X-ray (SXR), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements using a laser source with 23 ps pulse duration. The spectrometer's key specifications, such as brilliance, resolution, and stability, are characterized against the more commonly used longer-pulse-duration LPP sources. The 23 ps laser produced approximately an order of magnitude weaker SXR flux than the 8 ns laser for a higher power density due to the smaller total energy absorbed by the plasma. The increased repetition rate and an implemented self-referencing scheme still allowed for high-resolution, synchrotron-like NEXAFS measurements of Si3N4 and TiO2 thin films with 2.5 minute acquisition times. It was observed that degradation of the gas jet nozzle led to long-term instability of the source, which can be remediated using alternative nozzle designs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving higher temporal resolution in future time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements using table-top laser-produced plasma sources</description>

      <title>An SNSPD-based detector system for NASA's Deep Space Optical Communications project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a free-space-coupled superconducting nanowire single-photon detector array developed for NASA's Deep Space Optical Communications project (DSOC). The array serves as the downlink detector for DSOC's primary ground receiver terminal located at Palomar Observatory's 200-inch Hale Telescope. The 64-pixel WSi array comprises four quadrants of 16 co-wound pixels covering a 320 micron diameter active area and embedded in an optical stack. The detector system also includes cryogenic optics for filtering and focusing the downlink signal and electronics for biasing the array and amplifying the output pulses. The detector system exhibits a peak system detection efficiency of 76% at 1550 nm, a background-limited false count rate as low as 3.7 kcps across the array, timing jitter less than 120 ps FWHM, and a maximum count rate of ~ 1 Gcps.</description>

      <title>Physics Perspectives with the ePIC Far-Forward and Far-Backward detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming Electron--Ion Collider (EIC), which is expected to commence operations in the early 2030s, has already reached several significant milestones on its path toward completion. The core of the EIC physics program is the 3D imaging of partonic structures in protons and nuclei. The experimental detector setup required to enable this primary objective utilizes "far-forward" (FF) and "far-backward" (FB) detectors positioned downstream in the hadron-going and electron-going directions, respectively, from the interaction point of the EIC. The primary purpose of the FB detectors is to monitor luminosity and measure scattered electrons in collisions in the EIC, while the array of FF detectors is used to tag and reconstruct both charged and neutral particles that scatter at small angles. These detectors also enable a broader physics program than was initially envisioned, enhancing the EIC's research potential. The expanded capabilities have been a prime focus for engaging the broader nuclear physics community to build a robust groundwork for the EIC. In these proceedings, we will describe the FF/FB detectors and review the advanced forward physics program facilitated by them at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Measuring Electron Energy in Muon-to-Electron Conversion using Holographic Synchrotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent conversion of a muon to an electron in a nuclear field has been one of the most powerful methods to search for Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV). Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow e$ searches, primarily driven by advancements in muon beamline design and low-mass tracking detectors, which afford exceptional momentum resolution. Nevertheless, the performance of these detectors is inherently limited by electron scattering and energy loss within detector materials. To overcome these inevitable limitations, we propose a novel holographic track reconstruction leveraging synchrotron radiation emitted by electrons. Similar to cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES) which has demonstrated outstanding energy resolutions for low-energy electrons, our technique relies on a precision measurement of cyclotron frequency, but in a regime where photons are emitted stochastically and are projected onto a 2-dimensional inner surface of a solenoidal magnet. We outline the concept of such a massless holographic tracker and feasibility of employing this innovative detection strategy for $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. We also address pertinent limitations and challenges inherent to the method.</description>

      <title>Silicon Nitride Photonic Waveguide-Based Young's Interferometer for Molecular Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Devices based on photonic integrated circuits play a crucial role in the development of low-cost, high-performance, industry-scale manufacturable sensors. We report the design, fabrication, and application of a silicon nitride waveguide-based integrated photonic sensor in Young's interferometer configuration combined with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) imaging detection. We use a finite-difference time-domain method to analyze the performance of the sensor device and optimize the sensitivity of the fundamental transverse-electric (TE) mode. We develop a low-cost fabrication method for the photonic sensor chip, using photolithography-compatible dimensions, and produce the sensing region with wet-etching of silicon dioxide. We demonstrate the sensor's functioning by measuring the optical phase shift with glucose concentration in an aqueous solution. We obtain consistent interference patterns with fringe visibility exceeding 0.75 and measure the phase differences for glucose concentrations in the 10 ug/ml order, corresponding to the order of 10^7 molecules in the sensing volume. We envision extending this work to functionalized surface sensors based on molecular binding. Our work will impact biosensing applications and, more generally, the fabrication of interferometric-based photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Tunable Targets for Light Dark Matter Direct Detection: The Case of Solid Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose hydrostatic pressure -- a well-established tool for tuning properties of condensed matter -- as a novel route for optimizing targets for light dark matter direct detection, specifically via phonons. Pressure dramatically affects compressible solids by boosting the speed of sound and phonon frequencies. Focusing on helium -- the most compressible solid -- our ab initio calculations illustrate how high pressure elevates helium from lacking single-phonon reach to rivaling leading candidates. Our work establishes pressure as an unexplored tuning knob for accessing lower dark matter mass regimes.</description>

      <title>A Design of Hadronic Calorimeter for DarkSHINE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01780v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of the dark photon search through invisible decay final states in low background experiments significantly relies on the neutron and muon veto efficiency, which depends on the amount of material used and the design of detector geometry. This paper presents an optimized design of a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) used for the DarkSHINE experiment, which is studied using a GEANT4-based simulation framework. The geometry is optimized by comparing a traditional design with uniform absorbers to one that uses different thicknesses at different locations of the detector, which enhances the efficiency of vetoing low-energy neutrons at the sub-GeV level. The overall size and total amount of material used in HCAL are optimized to be lower due to the load and budget requirements, while the overall performance is studied to meet the physical objectives.</description>

      <title>Convolutional L2LFlows: Generating Accurate Showers in Highly Granular Calorimeters Using Convolutional Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest to build generative surrogate models as computationally efficient alternatives to rule-based simulations, the quality of the generated samples remains a crucial frontier. So far, normalizing flows have been among the models with the best fidelity. However, as the latent space in such models is required to have the same dimensionality as the data space, scaling up normalizing flows to high dimensional datasets is not straightforward. The prior L2LFlows approach successfully used a series of separate normalizing flows and sequence of conditioning steps to circumvent this problem. In this work, we extend L2LFlows to simulate showers with a 9-times larger profile in the lateral direction. To achieve this, we introduce convolutional layers and U-Net-type connections, move from masked autoregressive flows to coupling layers, and demonstrate the successful modelling of showers in the ILD Electromagnetic Calorimeter as well as Dataset 3 from the public CaloChallenge dataset.</description>

      <title>Polarized cold-neutron reflectometry at JRR-3/MINE2 for the development of ultracold-neutron spin analyzers for a neutron EDM experiment at TRIUMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) is a sensitive probe for currently undiscovered sources of charge-parity symmetry violation. As part of the TRIUMF Ultracold Advanced Neutron (TUCAN) collaboration, we are developing spin analyzers for ultracold neutrons (UCNs) to be used for a next-generation experiment to measure the neutron EDM with unprecedented precision. Spin-state analysis of UCNs constitutes an essential part of the neutron EDM measurement sequence. Magnetized iron films used as spin filters of UCNs are crucial experimental components, whose performance directly influences the statistical sensitivity of the measurement. To test such iron film spin filters, we propose the use of polarized cold-neutron reflectometry, in addition to conventional UCN transmission experiments. The new method provides information on iron film samples complementary to the UCN tests and accelerates the development cycles. We developed a collaborative effort to produce iron film spin filters and test them with cold and ultracold neutrons available at JRR-3/MINE2 and J-PARC/MLF BL05. In this article, we review the methods of neutron EDM measurements, discuss the complementarity of this new approach to test UCN spin filters, provide an overview of our related activities, and present the first results of polarized cold-neutron reflectometry recently conducted at the MINE2 beamline.</description>
