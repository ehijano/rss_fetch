      <title>SeqMate: A Novel Large Language Model Pipeline for Automating RNA Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA sequencing techniques, like bulk RNA-seq and Single Cell (sc) RNA-seq, are critical tools for the biologist looking to analyze the genetic activity/transcriptome of a tissue or cell during an experimental procedure. Platforms like Illumina's next-generation sequencing (NGS) are used to produce the raw data for this experimental procedure. This raw FASTQ data must then be prepared via a complex series of data manipulations by bioinformaticians. This process currently takes place on an unwieldy textual user interface like a terminal/command line that requires the user to install and import multiple program packages, preventing the untrained biologist from initiating data analysis. Open-source platforms like Galaxy have produced a more user-friendly pipeline, yet the visual interface remains cluttered and highly technical, remaining uninviting for the natural scientist. To address this, SeqMate is a user-friendly tool that allows for one-click analytics by utilizing the power of a large language model (LLM) to automate both data preparation and analysis (differential expression, trajectory analysis, etc). Furthermore, by utilizing the power of generative AI, SeqMate is also capable of analyzing such findings and producing written reports of upregulated/downregulated/user-prompted genes with sources cited from known repositories like PubMed, PDB, and Uniprot.</description>

      <title>MotifbreakR v2: extended capability and database integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MotifbreakR is a software tool that scans genetic variants against position weight matrices of transcription factors (TF) to determine the potential for the disruption of TF binding at the site of the variant. It leverages the Bioconductor suite of software packages and annotations to operate across a diverse array of genomes and motif databases. Initially developed to interrogate the effect of single nucleotide variants (common and rare SNVs) on potential TF binding sites, in motifbreakR v2, we have updated the functionality. New features include the ability to query other types of more complex genetic variants, such as short insertions and deletions (indels). This function allows modeling a more extensive array of variants that may have more significant effects on TF binding. Additionally, while TF binding is based partly on sequence preference, predictions of TF binding based on sequence preference alone can indicate many more potential binding events than observed. Adding information from DNA-binding sequencing datasets lends confidence to motif disruption prediction by demonstrating TF binding in cell lines and tissue types. Therefore, motifbreakR implements querying the ReMap2022 database for evidence that a TF matching the disrupted motif binds over the disrupting variant. Finally, in motifbreakR, in addition to the existing interface, we have implemented an R/Shiny graphical user interface to simplify and enhance access to researchers with different skill sets.</description>

      <title>Gene Set Summarization using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular biologists frequently interpret gene lists derived from high-throughput experiments and computational analysis. This is typically done as a statistical enrichment analysis that measures the over- or under-representation of biological function terms associated with genes or their properties, based on curated assertions from a knowledge base (KB) such as the Gene Ontology (GO). Interpreting gene lists can also be framed as a textual summarization task, enabling the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), potentially utilizing scientific texts directly and avoiding reliance on a KB.
  We developed SPINDOCTOR (Structured Prompt Interpolation of Natural Language Descriptions of Controlled Terms for Ontology Reporting), a method that uses GPT models to perform gene set function summarization as a complement to standard enrichment analysis. This method can use different sources of gene functional information: (1) structured text derived from curated ontological KB annotations, (2) ontology-free narrative gene summaries, or (3) direct model retrieval.
  We demonstrate that these methods are able to generate plausible and biologically valid summary GO term lists for gene sets. However, GPT-based approaches are unable to deliver reliable scores or p-values and often return terms that are not statistically significant. Crucially, these methods were rarely able to recapitulate the most precise and informative term from standard enrichment, likely due to an inability to generalize and reason using an ontology. Results are highly nondeterministic, with minor variations in prompt resulting in radically different term lists. Our results show that at this point, LLM-based methods are unsuitable as a replacement for standard term enrichment analysis and that manual curation of ontological assertions remains necessary.</description>

      <title>Semantically Rich Local Dataset Generation for Explainable AI in Genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black box deep learning models trained on genomic sequences excel at predicting the outcomes of different gene regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, interpreting these models may provide novel insights into the underlying biology, supporting downstream biomedical applications. Due to their complexity, interpretable surrogate models can only be built for local explanations (e.g., a single instance). However, accomplishing this requires generating a dataset in the neighborhood of the input, which must maintain syntactic similarity to the original data while introducing semantic variability in the model's predictions. This task is challenging due to the complex sequence-to-function relationship of DNA.
  We propose using Genetic Programming to generate datasets by evolving perturbations in sequences that contribute to their semantic diversity. Our custom, domain-guided individual representation effectively constrains syntactic similarity, and we provide two alternative fitness functions that promote diversity with no computational effort. Applied to the RNA splicing domain, our approach quickly achieves good diversity and significantly outperforms a random baseline in exploring the search space, as shown by our proof-of-concept, short RNA sequence. Furthermore, we assess its generalizability and demonstrate scalability to larger sequences, resulting in a ~30% improvement over the baseline.</description>
