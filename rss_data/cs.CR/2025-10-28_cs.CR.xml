      <title>SAND: A Self-supervised and Adaptive NAS-Driven Framework for Hardware Trojan Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The globalized semiconductor supply chain has made Hardware Trojans (HT) a significant security threat to embedded systems, necessitating the design of efficient and adaptable detection mechanisms. Despite promising machine learning-based HT detection techniques in the literature, they suffer from ad hoc feature selection and the lack of adaptivity, all of which hinder their effectiveness across diverse HT attacks. In this paper, we propose SAND, a selfsupervised and adaptive NAS-driven framework for efficient HT detection. Specifically, this paper makes three key contributions. (1) We leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) to enable automated feature extraction, eliminating the dependency on manually engineered features. (2) SAND integrates neural architecture search (NAS) to dynamically optimize the downstream classifier, allowing for seamless adaptation to unseen benchmarks with minimal fine-tuning. (3) Experimental results show that SAND achieves a significant improvement in detection accuracy (up to 18.3%) over state-of-the-art methods, exhibits high resilience against evasive Trojans, and demonstrates strong generalization.</description>

      <title>MCPGuard : Automatically Detecting Vulnerabilities in MCP Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized interface enabling seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external data sources and tools. While MCP significantly reduces development complexity and enhances agent capabilities, its openness and extensibility introduce critical security vulnerabilities that threaten system trustworthiness and user data protection. This paper systematically analyzes the security landscape of MCP-based systems, identifying three principal threat categories: (1) agent hijacking attacks stemming from protocol design deficiencies; (2) traditional web vulnerabilities in MCP servers; and (3) supply chain security. To address these challenges, we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies, examining both proactive server-side scanning approaches, ranging from layered detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zero-trust registry systems, and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous oversight and policy enforcement. Our analysis reveals that MCP security fundamentally represents a paradigm shift where the attack surface extends from traditional code execution to semantic interpretation of natural language metadata, necessitating novel defense mechanisms tailored to this unique threat model.</description>

      <title>QueryIPI: Query-agnostic Indirect Prompt Injection on Coding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs combine powerful tools and system-level actions, exposing a high-stakes attack surface. Existing Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors, leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates. We identify a more severe, query-agnostic threat that remains effective across diverse user inputs. This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability: leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.</description>

      <title>EthVault: A Secure and Resource-Conscious FPGA-Based Ethereum Cold Wallet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating, storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers. Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet, featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation. Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6% of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA.</description>

      <title>PRO: Enabling Precise and Robust Text Watermark for Open-Source LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability. A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria. A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits. Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model modifications.</description>

      <title>Victim as a Service: Designing a System for Engaging with Interactive Scammers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pig butchering, and similar interactive online scams, lower their victims' defenses by building trust over extended periods of conversation - sometimes weeks or months. They have become increasingly public losses (at least $75B by one recent study). However, because of their long-term conversational nature, they are extremely challenging to investigate at scale. In this paper, we describe the motivation, design, implementation, and experience with CHATTERBOX, an LLM-based system that automates long-term engagement with online scammers, making large-scale investigations of their tactics possible. We describe the techniques we have developed to attract scam attempts, the system and LLM-engineering required to convincingly engage with scammers, and the necessary capabilities required to satisfy or evade "milestones" in scammers' workflow.</description>

      <title>Scalable GPU-Based Integrity Verification for Large Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a security framework that strengthens distributed machine learning by standardizing integrity protections across CPU and GPU platforms and significantly reducing verification overheads. Our approach co-locates integrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU accelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads typically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally operate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate performance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g., Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across different GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution environments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Covert Surveillance in Smart Devices: A SCOUR Framework Analysis of Youth Privacy Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how smart devices covertly capture private conversations and discusses in more in-depth the implications of this for youth privacy. Using a structured review guided by the PRISMA methodology, the analysis focuses on privacy concerns, data capture methods, data storage and sharing practices, and proposed technical mitigations. To structure and synthesize findings, we introduce the SCOUR framework, encompassing Surveillance mechanisms, Consent and awareness, Operational data flow, Usage and exploitation, and Regulatory and technical safeguards. Findings reveal that smart devices have been covertly capturing personal data, especially with smart toys and voice-activated smart gadgets built for youth. These issues are worsened by unclear data collection practices and insufficient transparency in smart device applications. Balancing privacy and utility in smart devices is crucial, as youth are becoming more aware of privacy breaches and value their personal data more. Strategies to improve regulatory and technical safeguards are also provided. The review identifies research gaps and suggests future directions. The limitations of this literature review are also explained. The findings have significant implications for policy development and the transparency of data collection for smart devices.</description>

      <title>Traceable Signatures from Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traceable signatures (Kiayas et al., EUROCRYPT 2004) is an anonymous digital signature system that extends the tracing power of the opening authority in group signatures. There are many known constructions of traceable signatures, but all are based on number-theoretic/pairing assumptions. For such reason, they may not be secure in the presence of quantum computers. This work revisits the notion of traceable signatures and presents a lattice-based construction provably secure in the quantum random oracle model (QROM).</description>

      <title>Demystifying Cookie Sharing Risks in WebView-based Mobile App-in-app Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mini-programs, an emerging mobile application paradigm within super-apps, offer a seamless and installation-free experience. However, the adoption of the web-view component has disrupted their isolation mechanisms, exposing new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel vulnerability called Cross Mini-program Cookie Sharing (CMCS), which arises from the shared web-view environment across mini-programs. This vulnerability allows unauthorized data exchange across mini-programs by enabling one mini-program to access cookies set by another within the same web-view context, violating isolation principles. As a preliminary step, we analyzed the web-view mechanisms of four major platforms, including WeChat, AliPay, TikTok, and Baidu, and found that all of them are affected by CMCS vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the collusion attack enabled by CMCS, where privileged mini-programs exfiltrate sensitive user data via cookies accessible to unprivileged mini-programs. To measure the impact of collusion attacks enabled by CMCS vulnerabilities in the wild, we developed MiCoScan, a static analysis tool that detects mini-programs affected by CMCS vulnerabilities. MiCoScan employs web-view context modeling to identify clusters of mini-programs sharing the same web-view domain and cross-webview data flow analysis to detect sensitive data transmissions to/from web-views. Using MiCoScan, we conducted a large-scale analysis of 351,483 mini-programs, identifying 45,448 clusters sharing web-view domains, 7,965 instances of privileged data transmission, and 9,877 mini-programs vulnerable to collusion attacks. Our findings highlight the widespread prevalence and significant security risks posed by CMCS vulnerabilities, underscoring the urgent need for improved isolation mechanisms in mini-program ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench): A Meta-Benchmark for Evaluating Cybersecurity AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybersecurity spans multiple interconnected domains, complicating the development of meaningful, labor-relevant benchmarks. Existing benchmarks assess isolated skills rather than integrated performance. We find that pre-trained knowledge of cybersecurity in LLMs does not imply attack and defense abilities, revealing a gap between knowledge and capability. To address this limitation, we present the Cybersecurity AI Benchmark (CAIBench), a modular meta-benchmark framework that allows evaluating LLM models and agents across offensive and defensive cybersecurity domains, taking a step towards meaningfully measuring their labor-relevance. CAIBench integrates five evaluation categories, covering over 10,000 instances: Jeopardy-style CTFs, Attack and Defense CTFs, Cyber Range exercises, knowledge benchmarks, and privacy assessments. Key novel contributions include systematic simultaneous offensive-defensive evaluation, robotics-focused cybersecurity challenges (RCTF2), and privacy-preserving performance assessment (CyberPII-Bench). Evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals saturation on security knowledge metrics (~70\% success) but substantial degradation in multi-step adversarial (A\&amp;D) scenarios (20-40\% success), or worse in robotic targets (22\% success). The combination of framework scaffolding and LLM model choice significantly impacts performance; we find that proper matches improve up to 2.6$\times$ variance in Attack and Defense CTFs. These results demonstrate a pronounced gap between conceptual knowledge and adaptive capability, emphasizing the need for a meta-benchmark.</description>

      <title>Your Microphone Array Retains Your Identity: A Robust Voice Liveness Detection System for Smart Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though playing an essential role in smart home systems, smart speakers are vulnerable to voice spoofing attacks. Passive liveness detection, which utilizes only the collected audio rather than the deployed sensors to distinguish between live-human and replayed voices, has drawn increasing attention. However, it faces the challenge of performance degradation under the different environmental factors as well as the strict requirement of the fixed user gestures.
  In this study, we propose a novel liveness feature, array fingerprint, which utilizes the microphone array inherently adopted by the smart speaker to determine the identity of collected audios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that by leveraging the circular layout of microphones, compared with existing schemes, array fingerprint achieves a more robust performance under the environmental change and user's movement. Then, to leverage such a fingerprint, we propose ARRAYID, a lightweight passive detection scheme, and elaborate a series of features working together with array fingerprint. Our evaluation on the dataset containing 32,780 audio samples and 14 spoofing devices shows that ARRAYID achieves an accuracy of 99.84%, which is superior to existing passive liveness detection schemes.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Gaps Between RFC Updates and TCP/IP Implementations: LLM-Facilitated Differential Checks on Intermediate Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the core of the Internet infrastructure, the TCP/IP protocol stack undertakes the task of network data transmission. However, due to the complexity of the protocol and the uncertainty of cross-layer interaction, there are often inconsistencies between the implementation of the protocol stack code and the RFC standard. This inconsistency may not only lead to differences in protocol functions but also cause serious security vulnerabilities. At present, with the continuous expansion of protocol stack functions and the rapid iteration of RFC documents, it is increasingly important to detect and fix these inconsistencies. With the rise of large language models, researchers have begun to explore how to extract protocol specifications from RFC documents through these models, including protocol stack modeling, state machine extraction, text ambiguity analysis, and other related content. However, existing methods rely on predefined patterns or rule-based approaches that fail to generalize across different protocol specifications. Automated and scalable detection of these inconsistencies remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an automated analysis framework based on LLM and differential models. By modeling the iterative relationship of the protocol and based on the iterative update relationship of the RFC standard, we perform incremental code function analysis on different versions of kernel code implementations to automatically perform code detection and vulnerability analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations to validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying potential vulnerabilities caused by RFC code inconsistencies.</description>

Abstract: Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) deployed on memristive crossbar arrays provide energy-efficient solutions for edge computing but are susceptible to physical attacks due to memristor nonvolatility. Recently, Rajendran et al. (IEEE Embedded Systems Letter 2025) proposed a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)-based scheme to secure BNNs against theft attacks. Specifically, the weight and bias matrices of the BNN layers were secured by swapping columns based on device's PUF key bits.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that this scheme to secure BNNs is vulnerable to PUF-key recovery attack. As a consequence of our attack, we recover the secret weight and bias matrices of the BNN. Our approach is motivated by differential cryptanalysis and reconstructs the PUF key bit-by-bit by observing the change in model accuracy, and eventually recovering the BNN model parameters. Evaluated on a BNN trained on the MNIST dataset, our attack could recover 85% of the PUF key, and recover the BNN model up to 93% classification accuracy compared to the original model's 96% accuracy. Our attack is very efficient and it takes a couple of minutes to recovery the PUF key and the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Cloud Native Homomorphic Encryption Workflows for Privacy-Preserving ML Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data, allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs. However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity, and model compatibility issues.
  This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore, optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality under zero-trust cloud conditions.</description>

      <title>Feedback Lunch: Deep Feedback Codes for Wiretap Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16620v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned feedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage, illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication, to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare, capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations. Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates, they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security in code generation remains a pivotal challenge when applying large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces RefleXGen, an innovative method that significantly enhances code security by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with guided self-reflection mechanisms inherent in LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fine-tuning LLMs or developing specialized secure code datasets - processes that can be resource-intensive - RefleXGen iteratively optimizes the code generation process through self-assessment and reflection without the need for extensive resources. Within this framework, the model continuously accumulates and refines its knowledge base, thereby progressively improving the security of the generated code. Experimental results demonstrate that RefleXGen substantially enhances code security across multiple models, achieving a 13.6% improvement with GPT-3.5 Turbo, a 6.7% improvement with GPT-4o, a 4.5% improvement with CodeQwen, and a 5.8% improvement with Gemini. Our findings highlight that improving the quality of model self-reflection constitutes an effective and practical strategy for strengthening the security of AI-generated code.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy: Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task, and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks, albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data security and privacy.</description>

      <title>SafeVision: Efficient Image Guardrail with Robust Policy Adherence and Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever. Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats, requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks, which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm, a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party (VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.</description>

      <title>LLMLogAnalyzer: A Clustering-Based Log Analysis Chatbot using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes. This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks. LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks. Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and non-technical users.</description>

      <title>SPEAR++: Scaling Gradient Inversion via Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable. Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation, while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resistant Networks Using Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks rely on both quantum and classical channels for coordinated operation. Current architectures employ entanglement distribution and key exchange over quantum channels but often assume that classical communication is sufficiently secure. In practice, classical channels protected by traditional cryptography remain vulnerable to quantum adversaries, since large-scale quantum computers could break widely used public-key schemes and reduce the effective security of symmetric cryptography. This perspective presents a quantum-resistant network architecture that secures classical communication with post-quantum cryptographic techniques while supporting entanglement-based communication over quantum channels. Beyond cryptographic protection, the framework incorporates continuous monitoring of both quantum and classical layers, together with orchestration across heterogeneous infrastructures, to ensure end-to-end security. Collectively, these mechanisms provide a pathway toward scalable, robust, and secure quantum networks that remain dependable against both classical and quantum-era threats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE = 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current limitations.</description>

      <title>MapComp: A Secure View-based Collaborative Analytics Framework for Join-Group-Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01246v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Join-group-aggregation (JGA) queries are fundamental to data analytics, yet executing them collaboratively across different parties poses significant privacy risks. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) offers a cryptographic solution. However, existing MPC-based JGA approaches consider only a one-time query paradigm and suffer from significant performance bottlenecks. It executes expensive join operations from scratch across multiple queries and employs inefficient group-aggregation (GA) protocols, both of which hinder their practical use for scalable, real-time analysis.
  This paper introduces MapComp, a novel view-based framework to facilitate JGA queries for secure collaborative analytics. Through specially crafted materialized views for join and novel design of GA protocols, MapComp removes duplicate join workload and expedites subsequent GA, improving the efficiency of JGA query execution. To address the challenge of continuous data updates, our materialized view offers payload-independence feature and provides significant efficiency improvements in view refreshing with free MPC overhead. This feature, on the other hand, also allows further acceleration for GA, where we devise multiple novel protocols that outperform prior works. Notably, our work represents the first endeavor to expedite secure collaborative JGA queries using materialized views. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate a significant advantage of MapComp, achieving up to a 308.9x improvement in efficiency over the baseline in real-world query simulations. Moreover, our optimized GA protocols achieve up to a 1140.5x improvement compared to prior oblivious sorting-based solutions.</description>

Abstract: Answering end user security questions is challenging. While large language models (LLMs) like GPT, LLAMA, and Gemini are far from error-free, they have shown promise in answering a variety of questions outside of security. We studied LLM performance in the area of end user security by qualitatively evaluating 3 popular LLMs on 900 systematically collected end user security questions.
  While LLMs demonstrate broad generalist ``knowledge'' of end user security information, there are patterns of errors and limitations across LLMs consisting of stale and inaccurate answers, and indirect or unresponsive communication styles, all of which impacts the quality of information received. Based on these patterns, we suggest directions for model improvement and recommend user strategies for interacting with LLMs when seeking assistance with security.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Distinguishability of Product Distributions through Multicalibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03562v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a sequence of samples $x_1, \dots , x_k$ promised to be drawn from one of two distributions $X_0, X_1$, a well-studied problem in statistics is to decide $\textit{which}$ distribution the samples are from. Information theoretically, the maximum advantage in distinguishing the two distributions given $k$ samples is captured by the total variation distance between $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$. However, when we restrict our attention to $\textit{efficient distinguishers}$ (i.e., small circuits) of these two distributions, exactly characterizing the ability to distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ is more involved and less understood.
  In this work, we give a general way to reduce bounds on the computational indistinguishability of $X_0$ and $X_1$ to bounds on the $\textit{information-theoretic}$ indistinguishability of some specific, related variables $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$. As a consequence, we prove a new, tight characterization of the number of samples $k$ needed to efficiently distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ with constant advantage as
  \[
  k = \Theta\left(d_H^{-2}\left(\widetilde{X}_0, \widetilde{X}_1\right)\right),
  \] which is the inverse of the squared Hellinger distance $d_H$ between two distributions $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$ that are computationally indistinguishable from $X_0$ and $X_1$. Likewise, our framework can be used to re-derive a result of Halevi and Rabin (TCC 2008) and Geier (TCC 2022), proving nearly-tight bounds on how computational indistinguishability scales with the number of samples for arbitrary product distributions.</description>

Abstract: Differentially Private (DP) generative marginal models are often used in the wild to release synthetic tabular datasets in lieu of sensitive data while providing formal privacy guarantees. These models approximate low-dimensional marginals or query workloads; crucially, they require the training data to be pre-discretized, i.e., continuous values need to first be partitioned into bins. However, as the range of values (or their domain) is often inferred directly from the training data, with the number of bins and bin edges typically defined arbitrarily, this approach can ultimately break end-to-end DP guarantees and may not always yield optimal utility.
  In this paper, we present an extensive measurement study of four discretization strategies in the context of DP marginal generative models. More precisely, we design DP versions of three discretizers (uniform, quantile, and k-means) and reimplement the PrivTree algorithm. We find that optimizing both the choice of discretizer and bin count can improve utility, on average, by almost 30% across six DP marginal models, compared to the default strategy and number of bins, with PrivTree being the best-performing discretizer in the majority of cases. We demonstrate that, while DP generative models with non-private discretization remain vulnerable to membership inference attacks, applying DP during discretization effectively mitigates this risk. Finally, we improve on an existing approach for automatically selecting the optimal number of bins, and achieve high utility while reducing both privacy budget consumption and computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Securing Transfer-Learned Networks with Reverse Homomorphic Encryption</title>

Abstract: The growing body of literature on training-data reconstruction attacks raises significant concerns about deploying neural network classifiers trained on sensitive data. However, differentially private (DP) training (e.g. using DP-SGD) can defend against such attacks with large training datasets causing only minimal loss of network utility. Folklore, heuristics, and (albeit pessimistic) DP bounds suggest this fails for networks trained with small per-class datasets, yet to the best of our knowledge the literature offers no compelling evidence. We directly demonstrate this vulnerability by significantly extending reconstruction attack capabilities under a realistic adversary threat model for few-shot transfer learned image classifiers. We design new white-box and black-box attacks and find that DP-SGD is unable to defend against these without significant classifier utility loss. To address this, we propose a novel homomorphic encryption (HE) method that protects training data without degrading model's accuracy. Conventional HE secures model's input data and requires costly homomorphic implementation of the entire classifier. In contrast, our new scheme is computationally efficient and protects training data rather than input data. This is achieved by means of a simple role-reversal where classifier input data is unencrypted but transfer-learned weights are encrypted. Classifier outputs remain encrypted, thus preventing both white-box and black-box (and any other) training-data reconstruction attacks. Under this new scheme only a trusted party with a private decryption key can obtain the classifier class decisions.</description>

      <title>Unlearning Comparator: A Visual Analytics System for Comparative Evaluation of Machine Unlearning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove target training data from a trained model so that the removed data no longer influences the model's behavior, fulfilling "right to be forgotten" obligations under data privacy laws. Yet, we observe that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in analyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in terms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy. Consequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations, making it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To fill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator, designed to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system supports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and attack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two models, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline, at class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made after unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks (MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to determine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set. We evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU methods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model behaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/gnueaj/Machine-Unlearning-Comparator.</description>

      <title>The Signalgate Case is Waiving a Red Flag to All Organizational and Behavioral Cybersecurity Leaders, Practitioners, and Researchers: Are We Receiving the Signal Amidst the Noise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Signalgate incident of March 2025, wherein senior US national security officials inadvertently disclosed sensitive military operational details via the encrypted messaging platform Signal, highlights critical vulnerabilities in organizational security arising from human error, governance gaps, and the misuse of technology. Although smaller in scale when compared to historical breaches involving billions of records, Signalgate illustrates critical systemic issues often overshadowed by a focus on external cyber threats. Employing a case-study approach and systematic review grounded in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, we analyze the incident to identify patterns of human-centric vulnerabilities and governance challenges common to organizational security failures. Findings emphasize three critical points. (1) Organizational security depends heavily on human behavior, with internal actors often serving as the weakest link despite advanced technical defenses; (2) Leadership tone strongly influences organizational security culture and efficacy, and (3) widespread reliance on technical solutions without sufficient investments in human and organizational factors leads to ineffective practices and wasted resources. From these observations, we propose actionable recommendations for enhancing organizational and national security, including strong leadership engagement, comprehensive adoption of zero-trust architectures, clearer accountability structures, incentivized security behaviors, and rigorous oversight. Particularly during periods of organizational transition, such as mergers or large-scale personnel changes, additional measures become particularly important. Signalgate underscores the need for leaders and policymakers to reorient cybersecurity strategies toward addressing governance, cultural, and behavioral risks.</description>

      <title>Untargeted Jailbreak Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and COLD-Attack, typically optimize adversarial suffixes to align the LLM output with a predefined target response. However, by restricting the optimization objective as inducing a predefined target, these methods inherently constrain the adversarial search space, which limit their overall attack efficacy. Furthermore, existing methods typically require a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap between the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low attack efficiency.
  To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the first gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an unsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we formulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability of the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the objective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two differentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate the decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UJA can achieve over 80% attack success rates against recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations, outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and COLD-Attack by over 20%.</description>

      <title>A Cryptographic Perspective on the Verifiability of Quantum Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, achieving verifiable quantum advantage on a NISQ device has emerged as an important open problem in quantum information. The sampling-based quantum advantages are not known to have efficient verification methods. This paper investigates the verification of quantum advantage from a cryptographic perspective. We establish a strong connection between the verifiability of quantum advantage and cryptographic and complexity primitives, including efficiently samplable, statistically far but computationally indistinguishable pairs of (mixed) quantum states ($\mathsf{EFI}$), pseudorandom states ($\mathsf{PRS}$), and variants of minimum circuit size problems ($\mathsf{MCSP}$). Specifically, we prove that a) a sampling-based quantum advantage is either verifiable or can be used to build $\mathsf{EFI}$ and even $\mathsf{PRS}$ and b) polynomial-time algorithms for a variant of $\mathsf{MCSP}$ would imply efficient verification of quantum advantages. Our work shows that the quest for verifiable quantum advantages may lead to applications of quantum cryptography, and the construction of quantum primitives can provide new insights into the verifiability of quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Practical Bayes-Optimal Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop practical and theoretically grounded membership inference attacks (MIAs) against both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data and graph-structured data. Building on the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework of Sablayrolles et al., we derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for node-level MIAs against graph neural networks, addressing key open questions about optimal query strategies in the graph setting. We introduce BASE and G-BASE, tractable approximations of the Bayes-optimal membership inference. G-BASE achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed classifier-based node-level MIA attacks. BASE, which is also applicable to non-graph data, matches or exceeds the performance of prior state-of-the-art MIAs, such as LiRA and RMIA, at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we show that BASE and RMIA are equivalent under a specific hyperparameter setting, providing a principled, Bayes-optimal justification for the RMIA attack.</description>

      <title>GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</description>

      <title>Riemannian-Geometric Fingerprints of Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints. For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way. To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2 different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2 modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>PPFL-RDSN: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning-based Residual Dense Spatial Networks for Encrypted Lossy Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality images from low-resolution inputs using Residual Dense Spatial Networks (RDSNs) is crucial yet challenging. It is even more challenging in centralized training where multiple collaborating parties are involved, as it poses significant privacy risks, including data leakage and inference attacks, as well as high computational and communication costs. We propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning-based RDSN (PPFL-RDSN) framework specifically tailored for encrypted lossy image reconstruction. PPFL-RDSN integrates Federated Learning (FL), local differential privacy, and robust model watermarking techniques to ensure that data remains secure on local clients/devices, safeguards privacy-sensitive information, and maintains model authenticity without revealing underlying data. Empirical evaluations show that PPFL-RDSN achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art centralized methods while reducing computational burdens, and effectively mitigates security and privacy vulnerabilities, making it a practical solution for secure and privacy-preserving collaborative computer vision applications.</description>
