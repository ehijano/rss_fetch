      <title>CoEvo: Continual Evolution of Symbolic Solutions Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in artificial intelligence, capable of processing and understanding extensive human knowledge to enhance problem-solving across various domains. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to drive the discovery of symbolic solutions within scientific and engineering disciplines, where such solutions are crucial for advancing theoretical and practical applications. We propose a novel framework that utilizes LLMs in an evolutionary search methodology, augmented by a dynamic knowledge library that integrates and refines insights in an \textit{open-ended manner}. This approach aims to tackle the dual challenges of efficiently navigating complex symbolic representation spaces and leveraging both existing and newly generated knowledge to foster open-ended innovation. By enabling LLMs to interact with and expand upon a knowledge library, we facilitate the continuous generation of novel solutions in diverse forms such as language, code, and mathematical expressions. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method not only enhances the efficiency of searching for symbolic solutions but also supports the ongoing discovery process, akin to human scientific endeavors. This study represents a first effort in conceptualizing the search for symbolic solutions as a lifelong, iterative process, marking a significant step towards harnessing AI in the perpetual pursuit of scientific and engineering breakthroughs.

      <title>Quantum memristors for neuromorphic quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning may permit to realize more efficient machine learning calculations with near-term quantum devices. Among the diverse quantum machine learning paradigms which are currently being considered, quantum memristors are promising as a way of combining, in the same quantum hardware, a unitary evolution with the nonlinearity provided by the measurement and feedforward. Thus, an efficient way of deploying neuromorphic quantum computing for quantum machine learning may be enabled.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Deep Learning: Non-backpropagation and Non-optimization Machine Learning Approach Using Hebbian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing strong AI could provide a powerful tool for addressing social and scientific challenges. Neural networks (NNs), inspired by biological systems, have the potential to achieve this. However, weight optimization techniques using error backpropagation are not observed in biological systems, raising doubts about current NNs approaches. In this context, Itoh (2024) solved the MNIST classification problem without using objective functions or backpropagation. However, weight updates were not used, so it does not qualify as machine learning AI. In this study, I develop a machine learning method that mimics biological neural systems by implementing Hebbian learning in NNs without backpropagation and optimization method to solve the MNIST classification problem and analyze its output. Development proceeded in three stages. In the first stage, I applied the Hebbian learning rule to the MNIST character recognition algorithm by Itoh (2024), resulting in lower accuracy than non-Hebbian NNs, highlighting the limitations of conventional training procedures for Hebbian learning. In the second stage, I examined the properties of individually trained NNs using norm-based cognition, showing that NNs trained on a specific label respond powerfully to that label. In the third stage, I created an MNIST character recognition program using vector norm magnitude as the criterion, achieving an accuracy of approximately 75%. This demonstrates that the Hebbian learning NNs can recognize handwritten characters without objective functions, backpropagation, optimization processes, and large data set. Based on these results, developing a mechanism based on norm-based cognition as a fundamental unit and then increasing complexity to achieve indirect similarity cognition should help mimic biological neural systems and contribute to realizing strong AI.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Information in Neuron Populations for Neuromorphic Spike Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic applications emulate the processing performed by the brain by using spikes as inputs instead of time-varying analog stimuli. Therefore, these time-varying stimuli have to be encoded into spikes, which can induce important information loss. To alleviate this loss, some studies use population coding strategies to encode more information using a population of neurons rather than just one neuron. However, configuring the encoding parameters of such a population is an open research question. This work proposes an approach based on maximizing the mutual information between the signal and the spikes in the population of neurons. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the information-theoretic framework of Partial Information Decomposition. Two applications are presented: blood pressure pulse wave classification, and neural action potential waveform classification. In both tasks, the data is encoded into spikes and the encoding parameters of the neuron populations are tuned to maximize the encoded information using the proposed algorithm. The spikes are then classified and the performance is measured using classification accuracy as a metric. Two key results are reported. Firstly, adding neurons to the population leads to an increase in both mutual information and classification accuracy beyond what could be accounted for by each neuron separately, showing the usefulness of population coding strategies. Secondly, the classification accuracy obtained with the tuned parameters is near-optimal and it closely follows the mutual information as more neurons are added to the population. Furthermore, the proposed approach significantly outperforms random parameter selection, showing the usefulness of the proposed approach. These results are reproduced in both applications.</description>

      <title>Populating cellular metamaterials on the extrema of attainable elasticity through neuroevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.</description>
