      <title>The Economics of AI Foundation Models: Openness, Competition, and Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strategic choice of model "openness" has become a defining issue for the foundation model (FM) ecosystem. While this choice is intensely debated, its underlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period game-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value chain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant developer. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to the entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a "data flywheel effect," whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the deployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's optimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of the data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very strong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an intermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's learning. This dynamic gives rise to an "openness trap," a critical policy paradox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic flexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to show that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical integration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel effect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient competitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be captured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness adjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the developer's strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we provide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective policy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem.</description>

      <title>How to Sell High-Dimensional Data Optimally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of selling large, proprietary data, we consider an information pricing problem proposed by Bergemann et al. that involves a decision-making buyer and a monopolistic seller. The seller has access to the underlying state of the world that determines the utility of the various actions the buyer may take. Since the buyer gains greater utility through better decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the seller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price. To contend with the fact that the seller may not be perfectly informed about the buyer's private preferences (or utility), we frame the problem of designing a data product as one where the seller designs a revenue-maximizing menu of statistical experiments.
  Prior work by Cai et al. showed that an optimal menu can be found in time polynomial in the state space, whereas we observe that the state space is naturally exponential in the dimension of the data. We propose an algorithm which, given only sampling access to the state space, provably generates a near-optimal menu with a number of samples independent of the state space. We then analyze a special case of high-dimensional Gaussian data, showing that (a) it suffices to consider scalar Gaussian experiments, (b) the optimal menu of such experiments can be found efficiently via a semidefinite program, and (c) full surplus extraction occurs if and only if a natural separation condition holds on the set of potential preferences of the buyer.</description>

      <title>Reputation in the Shadow of Exit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18884v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study reputation formation in repeated games where player actions endogenously determine the probability the game permanently ends. Permanent exit can render reputation useless even to a patient long-lived player whose actions are perfectly monitored, in stark contrast to canonical commitment payoff theorems. However, I identify tight conditions for the long-run player to attain their Stackelberg payoff in the unique Markov equilibrium. Along the way, I highlight the role of Markov strategies in pinning down the value of reputation formation. I apply my results to give qualified commitment foundations for the infinite chain-store game. I also analyze repeated global games with exit, and obtain new predictions about regime survival.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Interval-Regulated Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study third-degree price discrimination in a model first presented by Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [2015]. Since such price discrimination might create market segments with vastly different posted prices, we consider regulating these prices, specifically, by restricting them to lie within an interval. Given a price interval, we consider segmentations of the market where a seller, who is oblivious to the existence of such regulation, still posts prices within the price interval. We show the following surprising result: For any market and price interval where such segmentation is feasible, there is always a different segmentation that optimally transfers all excess surplus to the consumers. In addition, we characterize the entire space of buyer and seller surplus that is achievable by such segmentation, including maximizing seller surplus, and simultaneously minimizing buyer and seller surplus. A key technical challenge is that the classical segmentation method of Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [2015] fails under price constraints. To address this, we develop three intuitive but fundamentally distinct segmentation constructions, each tailored to a different surplus objective. These constructions maintain different invariants, reflect different economic intuitions, and collectively form the core of our regulated surplus characterization.</description>

      <title>Multi-Item Screening with a Maximin-Ratio Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-item screening, optimal selling mechanisms are challenging to characterize and implement, even with full knowledge of valuation distributions. In this paper, we aim to develop tractable, interpretable, and implementable mechanisms with strong performance guarantees in the absence of precise distributional knowledge. In particular, we study robust screening with a maximin ratio objective. We show that given the marginal support of valuations, the optimal mechanism is separable: each item's allocation probability and payment depend only on its own valuation and not on other items' valuations. However, we design the allocation and payment rules by leveraging the available joint support information. This enhanced separable mechanism can be efficiently implemented through randomized pricing for individual products, which is easy to interpret and implement. Moreover, our framework extends naturally to scenarios where the seller possesses marginal support information on aggregate valuations for any product bundle partition, for which we characterize a bundle-wise separable mechanism and its guarantee. Beyond rectangular-support ambiguity sets, we further establish the optimality of randomized grand bundling mechanisms within a broad class of ambiguity sets, which we term ``$\boldsymbol{\rho}-$scaled invariant ambiguity set".</description>

      <title>The Division of Surplus and the Burden of Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A principal and an agent divide a surplus. Only the agent knows the surplus' true size and decides how much of it to reveal initially. Both parties can exert costly effort to conclusively prove the surplus' true size. The agent's liability is bounded by the revealed surplus. The principal is equipped with additional funds. The principal commits to their own effort and, contingent on who provided evidence, to a division of surplus. With this multitude of instruments, the principal simultaneously motivates the agent to reveal the surplus and to exert effort to share the burden of proof. In optimal mechanisms, the principal exhausts these instruments in a particular order that divides the surplus level into five intervals. Consequently, the induced agent effort first decreases in the surplus and then alternates its slope across the five intervals. The principal's effort always decreases. Applications include wealth taxation, corporate finance, and public procurements.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transfer Mechanism for Municipal Soft-Budget Constraints in Newfoundland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newfoundland and Labrador's municipalities face severe soft budget pressures due to narrow tax bases, high fixed service costs, and volatile resource revenues. We develop a Stackelberg style mechanism design model in which the province commits at t = 0 to an ex ante grant schedule and an ex post bailout rule. Municipalities privately observe their fiscal need type, choose effort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a statutory threshold. Under convexity and single crossing, the problem reduces to one dimensional screening and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a statutory cap. The optimal ex ante rule is threshold-cap; under discretionary rescue at t = 2, it becomes threshold-linear-cap. A knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no bailout regime, and an explicit discount factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible. We emphasize a class of monotone threshold signal rules; under this class, grant crowd out is null almost everywhere, which justifies the constant grant weight used in closed form expressions. The closed form characterization provides a policy template that maps to Newfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future calibration.</description>
