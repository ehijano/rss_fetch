      <title>Equivariant cohomology of odd-dimensional complex quadrics from a combinatorial point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to determine the ring structure of the torus equivariant cohomology of odd-dimensional complex quadrics by computing the graph equivariant cohomology of their corresponding GKM graphs. We show that its graph equivariant cohomology is generated by three types of subgraphs in the GKM graph, which are subject to four different types of relations. Furthermore, we consider the relationship between the two graph equivariant cohomology rings induced by odd- and even-dimensional complex quadrics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the homotopical analysis of enveloping operads in a general cofibrantly generated symmetric monoidal model category. We show the potential of this analysis by obtaining, in a uniform way, several central results regarding the homotopy theory of operadic algebras.</description>

      <title>Algebras over not too little discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the introduction of locally constant prefactorization algebras at a fixed scale, we show a mathematical incarnation of the fact that observables at a given scale of a topological field theory propagate to every scale over euclidean spaces. The key is that these prefactorization algebras over $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent to algebras over the little $n$-disc operad. For topological field theories with defects, we get analogous results by replacing $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the spaces modelling corners $\mathbb{R}^p\times\mathbb{R}^{q}_{\geq 0}$. As a toy example in $1d$, we quantize, once more, constant Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>On stratifications and poset-stratified spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stratified space is a topological space equipped with a \emph{stratification}, which is a decomposition or partition of the topological space satisfying certain extra conditions. More recently, the notion of poset-stratified space, i.e., topological space endowed with a continuous map to a poset with its Alexandrov topology, has been popularized. Both notions of stratified spaces are ubiquitous in mathematics, ranging from investigations of singular structures in algebraic geometry to extensions of the homotopy hypothesis in higher category theory. In this article we study the precise mathematical relation between these different approaches to stratified spaces.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Brain Tumor Connectomics using Graphs and Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in molecular and genetic research have identified a diverse range of brain tumor sub-types, shedding light on differences in their molecular mechanisms, heterogeneity, and origins. The present study performs whole-brain connectome analysis using diffusionweighted images. To achieve this, both graph theory and persistent homology - a prominent approach in topological data analysis are employed in order to quantify changes in the structural connectivity of the wholebrain connectome in subjects with brain tumors. Probabilistic tractography is used to map the number of streamlines connecting 84 distinct brain regions, as delineated by the Desikan-Killiany atlas from FreeSurfer. These streamline mappings form the connectome matrix, on which persistent homology based analysis and graph theoretical analysis are executed to evaluate the discriminatory power between tumor sub-types that include meningioma and glioma. A detailed statistical analysis is conducted on persistent homology-derived topological features and graphical features to identify the brain regions where differences between study groups are statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). For classification purpose, graph-based local features are utilized, achieving a highest accuracy of 88%. In classifying tumor sub-types, an accuracy of 80% is attained. The findings obtained from this study underscore the potential of persistent homology and graph theoretical analysis of the whole-brain connectome in detecting alterations in structural connectivity patterns specific to different types of brain tumors.</description>

      <title>Exponentiable functors between synthetic $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exponentiable functors in the context of synthetic $\infty$-categories. We do this within the framework of simplicial Homotopy Type Theory of Riehl and Shulman. Our main result characterizes exponentiable functors. In order to achieve this, we explore Segal type completions. Moreover, we verify that our result is semantically sound.</description>

      <title>The space of $r$-immersions of a union of discs in $\mathbb R^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a manifold $M$ and an integer $r&gt;1$, the space of $r$-immersions of $M$ in $\mathbb R^n$ is defined to be the space of immersions of $M$ in $\mathbb R^n$ such that the preimage of every point in $\mathbb R^n$ contains fewer than $r$ points. We consider the space of $r$-immersions when $M$ is a disjoint union of $k$ $m$-dimensional discs, and prove that it is equivalent to the product of the $r$-configuration space of $k$ points in $\mathbb R^n$ and the $k^{\text{th}}$ power of the space of injective linear maps from $\mathbb R^m$ to $\mathbb R^n$. This result is needed in order to apply Michael Weiss's manifold calculus to the study of $r$-immersions. The analogous statement for spaces of embeddings is ``well-known'', but a detailed proof is hard to find in the literature, and the existing proofs seem to use the isotopy extension theorem, if only as a matter of convenience. Isotopy extension does not hold for $r$-immersions, so we spell out the details of a proof that avoids using it, and applies to spaces of $r$-immersions.</description>

      <title>Circle actions and Suspension operations on Smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with $\dim M\geq 3$ and a base point $x_{0}$. Surgeries along the oriented circle $S^{1}\times \{x_{0}\}$ on the product $ S^{1}\times M$ yields two manifolds $\Sigma _{0}M$ and $\Sigma _{1}M$, called the suspensions of $M$.
  The suspension operations $\Sigma _{i}$ play a basic role in the construction and classification of the smooth manifolds which admit free $ S^{1}$-actions. We illustrate this by a number of applications.</description>
