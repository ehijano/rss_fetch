      <title>Fuzzy Variational Calculus in Linearly Correlated Space: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is the first part of series of articles that aim to present the foundations for fuzzy variational calculus for functions taking values in the space of linearly correlated fuzzy numbers $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{F}(A)}$. Recall that the space $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{F}(A)}$ is composed by all sums of a real number $r$ and a fuzzy number $qA$, where $A$ is a given asymmetric fuzzy number. Two advantages of this space are that it can be equipped with a Banach space structure and, similar to additive models in Statistics, its elements can be interpreted as the sum of a deterministic expected/predictable value with an uncertain/noise component. The foundation of variational calculus theory requires the definition and establishement of many concepts and results. This aritcle presents a total order relation on $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{F}(A)}$ for wihch the notions of local minimal and maximal of a $\mathbb{R}_{\mathcal{F}(A)}$-valued function $f$ can be derived. We present a fuzzy version of the first and second optimality conditions in terms of derivatives of $f$. Finally, we present a generalized fuzzy version of du Bois-Reymond lemma which is essential in variational calculus theory.</description>

      <title>An Alternate Method for Finding Particular Solutions of Nonhomegeneous Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note we are presenting a method of finding particular solutions of nonhomegeneous linear equations. This approach is different from methods of undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters presented in virtually every standard Differential Equations textbook.</description>

      <title>An efficient method of spline approximation for power function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P(m, X, N)$ be an $m$-degree polynomial in $X\in\mathbb{R}$ having fixed non-negative integers $m$ and $N$. The polynomial $P(m, X, N)$ is derived from a rearrangement of Faulhaber's formula in the context of Knuth's work entitled "Johann Faulhaber and sums of powers". In this manuscript we discuss the approximation properties of polynomial $P(m,X,N)$. In particular, the polynomial $P(m,X,N)$ approximates the odd power function $X^{2m+1}$ in a certain neighborhood of a fixed non-negative integer $N$ with a percentage error under $1\%$. By increasing the value of $N$ the length of convergence interval with odd-power $X^{2m+1}$ also increases. Furthermore, this approximation technique is generalized for arbitrary non-negative exponent $j$ of the power function $X^j$ by using splines.</description>

      <title>Calculus for Functions with Fuzzy Inputs and Outputs: Applications to Fuzzy Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a theory of differential and integral calculus for mapping between Banach spaces formed by subsets of fuzzy numbers called A-linearly correlated fuzzy numbers, where both the domain and codomain are spaces composed of fuzzy numbers. This is one of the main contributions of this study from a theoretical point of view, as well-known approaches to fuzzy calculus in the literature typically deal with fuzzy number-valued functions defined on intervals of real numbers. Notions of differentiability and integrability based on complex functions are proposed. Moreover, we introduce the study of ordinary differential equations for which the solutions are functions from A-linearly correlated fuzzy numbers to A-linearly correlated fuzzy numbers or from real functions to A-linearly correlated fuzzy numbers. For the latter case, we present an initial study of the solution and its phase portrait for two-dimensional differential equation systems. In particular, for the former case, we examine the Lotka Volterra model and analyze its phase portrait.</description>
