      <title>A Cyclical Fast Iterative Method for Simulating Reentries in Cardiac Electrophysiology Using an Eikonal-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Computer models for simulating cardiac electrophysiology are valuable tools for research and clinical applications. Traditional reaction-diffusion (RD) models used for these purposes are computationally expensive. While eikonal models offer a faster alternative, they are not well-suited to study cardiac arrhythmias driven by reentrant activity. The present work extends the diffusion-reaction eikonal alternant model (DREAM), incorporating conduction velocity (CV) restitution for simulating complex cardiac arrhythmias.
  Methods: The DREAM modifies the fast iterative method to model cyclical behavior, dynamic boundary conditions, and frequency-dependent anisotropic CV. Additionally, the model alternates with an approximated RD model, using a detailed ionic model for the reaction term and a triple-Gaussian to approximate the diffusion term. The DREAM and monodomain models were compared, simulating reentries in 2D manifolds with different resolutions.
  Results: The DREAM produced similar results across all resolutions, while experiments with the monodomain model failed at lower resolutions. CV restitution curves obtained using the DREAM closely approximated those produced by the monodomain simulations. Reentry in 2D slabs yielded similar results in vulnerable window and mean reentry duration for low CV in both models. In the left atrium, most inducing points identified by the DREAM were also present in the high-resolution monodomain model. DREAM's reentry simulations on meshes with an average edge length of 1600$\mu$m were 40x faster than monodomain simulations at 200$\mu$m.
  Conclusion: This work establishes the mathematical foundation for using the accelerated DREAM simulation method for cardiac electrophysiology. Cardiac research applications are enabled by a publicly available implementation in the openCARP simulator.</description>

      <title>A Wireless, Multicolor Fluorescence Image Sensor Implant for Real-Time Monitoring in Cancer Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring of dynamic biological processes in the body is critical to understanding disease progression and treatment response. This data, for instance, can help address the lower than 50% response rates to cancer immunotherapy. However, current clinical imaging modalities lack the molecular contrast, resolution, and chronic usability for rapid and accurate response assessments. Here, we present a fully wireless image sensor featuring a 2.5$\times$5 mm$^2$ CMOS integrated circuit for multicolor fluorescence imaging deep in tissue. The sensor operates wirelessly via ultrasound (US) at 5 cm depth in oil, harvesting energy with 221 mW/cm$^{2}$ incident US power density (31% of FDA limits) and backscattering data at 13 kbps with a bit error rate &lt;$10^{-6}$. In-situ fluorescence excitation is provided by micro-laser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical frontend combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate provides &gt;6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A 36$\times$40-pixel array captures images with &lt;125 $\mu$m resolution. We demonstrate wireless, dual-color fluorescence imaging of both effector and suppressor immune cells in ex vivo mouse tumor samples with and without immunotherapy. These results show promise for providing rapid insight into therapeutic response and resistance, guiding personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Silver-enriched Microdomain Patterns as Advanced Bactericidal Coatings for Polymer-based Medical Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, it would be difficult for us to live a full life without polymers, especially in medicine, where its applicability is constantly expanding, giving satisfactory results without any harm effects on health. This study focused on the formation of hexagonal domains doped with AgNPs using a KrF excimer laser ({\lambda}=248 nm) on the polyetheretherketone (PEEK) surface that acts as an unfailing source of the antibacterial agent - silver. The hexagonal structure was formed with a grid placed in front of the incident laser beam. Surfaces with immobilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were observed by AFM and SEM. Changes in surface chemistry were studied by XPS. To determine the concentration of released Ag+ ions, ICP-MS analysis was used. The antibacterial tests proved the antibacterial efficacy of Ag-doped PEEK composites against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus as the most common pathogens. Because AgNPs are also known for their strong toxicity, we also included cytotoxicity tests in this study. The findings presented here contribute to the advancement of materials design in the biomedical field, offering a novel starting point for combating bacterial infections through the innovative integration of AgNPs into inert synthetic polymers.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Conventional Endovascular Devices in Treatment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) are often repaired through an Endovascular approach known as EVAR. The success and duration of these challenging procedures are primarily attributable to the accuracy and reliability of navigating corresponding interventional devices. This study investigates the performance of conventional non-steerable and steerable catheters in endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) procedures, focusing on two primary metrics: reachable workspace and gate cannulation success. We developed two abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) phantoms using patient CT images for our experiments. Under X-ray fluoroscopy guidance, the reachable workspace was quantified, and gate cannulation success rates, cannulation time, and fluoroscopy times were recorded for both non-steerable and steerable catheters and were compared. We were unable to observe statistically significant differences between the two catheter types in overall cannulation success rates or fluoroscopy time. However, in challenging anatomical scenarios (particularly a more challenging gate location), the steerable catheter showed statistically significant advantages in success rates and cannulation times. While there were no statistical differences in reachable workspace between non-steerable and steerable catheters when considering the whole aneurysm, segmented analysis showed that the steerable catheter performed better in the central region, and non-steerable catheters performed better in the peripheral region. This study provides a systematic method for quantifying the performance of endovascular devices. The findings suggest that while steerable catheters may offer advantages in complex anatomical conditions, non-steerable catheters are preferable in peripheral areas of the aneurysm. These insights can inform catheter selection in EVAR, potentially influencing device design and clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence-enhanced photodynamic assessments for human breast cancer cell characterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary and metastatic stages of BC consider different cancerous cell lines (MDAs), meaning the highest number of cells in this research (300,000) represents the metastatic stages of BC, and 50,000 represents the primary level of BC developments have been studied based on fluorescence-enhanced photodynamic characterizations. The ability to characterize the fluorescence caused by MDA with 50,000 cells compared to the dominant radiation of MDA with 300,000 cells is emphatic proof of the high potential of fluorescence technique in timely BC detections. 5-ALA induces an accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) photosensitizer through a biosynthetic pathway, leading to red radiation of fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence signal reduction due to decreased cell viability and increased MDA's cellular death rate corresponds to the changes in lipid metabolism enzymes of MDAs cultured at different doses. Furthermore, statistical concerns have been studied using PCA multivariate component analysis to differentiate MDA cells administrated by 5-ALA.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a versatile method for full-field, X-ray scattering tensor tomography that is based on energy conservation and is applicable to data obtained using different wavefront modulators. Using this algorithm, we pave the way for speckle-based tensor tomography. The proposed model relies on a mathematical approach that allows tuning spatial resolution and signal sensitivity. We present the application of the algorithm to three different imaging modalities and demonstrate its potential for applications of X-ray directional dark-field imaging.</description>

      <title>ALMA: a mathematics-driven approach for determining tuning parameters in generalized LASSO problems, with applications to MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful technique employed for non-invasive in vivo visualization of internal structures. Sparsity is often deployed to accelerate the signal acquisition or overcome the presence of motion artifacts, improving the quality of image reconstruction. Image reconstruction algorithms use TV-regularized LASSO (Total Variation-regularized LASSO) to retrieve the missing information of undersampled signals, by cleaning the data of noise and while optimizing sparsity. A tuning parameter moderates the balance between these two aspects; its choice affecting the quality of the reconstructions. Currently, there is a lack of general deterministic techniques to choose these parameters, which are oftentimes manually selected and thus hinder the reliability of the reconstructions. Here, we present ALMA (Algorithm for Lagrange Multipliers Approximation), an iterative mathematics-inspired technique that computes tuning parameters for generalized LASSO problems during MRI reconstruction. We analyze quantitatively the performance of these parameters for imaging reconstructions via TV-LASSO in an MRI context on phantoms. Although our study concentrates on TV-LASSO, the techniques developed here hold significant promise for a wide array of applications. ALMA is not only adaptable to more generalized LASSO problems but is also robust to accommodate other forms of regularization beyond total variation. Moreover, it extends effectively to handle non-Cartesian sampling trajectories, broadening its utility in complex data reconstruction scenarios. More generally, ALMA provides a powerful tool for numerically solving constrained optimization problems across various disciplines, offering a versatile and impactful solution for advanced computational challenges.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the local contractility of the cardiac muscle from deficient apparent kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active solids are a large class of materials, including both living soft tissues and artificial matter, that share the ability to undergo strain even in absence of external loads. While in engineered materials the actuation is typically designed a priori, in natural materials it is an unknown of the problem. In such a framework, the identification of inactive regions in active materials is of particular interest. An example of paramount relevance is cardiac mechanics and the assessment of regions of the cardiac muscle with impaired contractility. The impossibility to measure the local active forces directly suggests us to develop a novel methodology exploiting kinematic data from clinical images by a variational approach to reconstruct the local contractility of the cardiac muscle. By finding the stationary points of a suitable cost functional we recover the contractility map of the muscle. Numerical experiments, including severe conditions with added noise to model uncertainties, and data knowledge limited to the boundary, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Unlike other methods, we provide a spatially continuous recovery of the contractility map without compromising the computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>First ClearMind gamma detector prototype for TOF-PET imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ClearMind project aims to develop a TOF-PET position-sensitive detection module optimized for time and spatial resolutions and detection efficiency. For this, we use a 59 mm $\times$ 59 mm $\times$ 5 mm monolithic PbWO$_4$ (PWO) crystal, which is encapsulated within a commercial Micro-Channel Plate Photomultiplier tube MAPMT253 with a bialkali photocathode directly deposited on the crystal. We report the proof of concept of the directly deposited of a bialkali photocathode on a PWO crystal and its stability over time. The full calibration of the ClearMind photodetector module in the single-photoelectron regime is described. We measured a time resolution of 70 ps FWHM using a 20 ps pulsed laser. We present the performance of the prototype used in coincidence with a 3 $\times$ 3 $\times$ 3 mm$^3$ LYSO:Ca,Ce crystal readout by a SiPM. We obtained a coincidence time resolution of 350 ps FWHM, a spatial resolution of 4 to 5 mm, and a detection efficiency of 28 %, consistent with Monte Carlo simulations of the ClearMind detector module.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes $\mu$GUIDE: a general Bayesian framework to estimate posterior distributions of tissue microstructure parameters from any given biophysical model or MRI signal representation, with exemplar demonstration in diffusion-weighted MRI. Harnessing a new deep learning architecture for automatic signal feature selection combined with simulation-based inference and efficient sampling of the posterior distributions, $\mu$GUIDE bypasses the high computational and time cost of conventional Bayesian approaches and does not rely on acquisition constraints to define model-specific summary statistics. The obtained posterior distributions allow to highlight degeneracies present in the model definition and quantify the uncertainty and ambiguity of the estimated parameters.</description>

      <title>Towards AI Lesion Tracking in PET/CT Imaging: A Siamese-based CNN Pipeline applied on PSMA PET/CT Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing tumor response to systemic therapies is one of the main applications of PET/CT. Routinely, only a small subset of index lesions out of multiple lesions is analyzed. However, this operator dependent selection may bias the results due to possible significant inter-metastatic heterogeneity of response to therapy. Automated, AI based approaches for lesion tracking hold promise in enabling the analysis of many more lesions and thus providing a better assessment of tumor response. This work introduces a Siamese CNN approach for lesion tracking between PET/CT scans. Our approach is applied on the laborious task of tracking a high number of bone lesions in full-body baseline and follow-up [68Ga]Ga- or [18F]F-PSMA PET/CT scans after two cycles of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients. Data preparation includes lesion segmentation and affine registration. Our algorithm extracts suitable lesion patches and forwards them into a Siamese CNN trained to classify the lesion patch pairs as corresponding or non-corresponding lesions. Experiments have been performed with different input patch types and a Siamese network in 2D and 3D. The CNN model successfully learned to classify lesion assignments, reaching a lesion tracking accuracy of 83 % in its best configuration with an AUC = 0.91. For remaining lesions the pipeline accomplished a re-identification rate of 89 %. We proved that a CNN may facilitate the tracking of multiple lesions in PSMA PET/CT scans. Future clinical studies are necessary if this improves the prediction of the outcome of therapies.</description>
