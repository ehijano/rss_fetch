      <title>Meander diagrams of virtual knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For classical knots, there is a concept of (semi)meander diagrams; in this short note we generalize this concept to virtual knots and prove that the classes of meander and semimeander diagrams are universal (this was known for classical knots). We also introduce a new class of invariants for virtual knots -- virtual $k$-arc crossing numbers.</description>

      <title>Smooth finite group actions on homology six-spheres with odd euler chracteristic fixed point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that if a finite group acts smoothly and effectively on an integral homology six-sphere and the fixed point set has an odd Euler characteristic, then the acting group is isomorphic to either the alternating group on five letters, the symmetric group on five letters, or the Cartesian product of the alternating group on five letters and a group of order 2 and the fixed point set consists of precisely one point.</description>

      <title>Planar Equivalence of Knotoids and Quandle Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While knotoids on the sphere are well-understood by a variety of invariants, knotoids on the plane have proven more subtle to classify due to their multitude over knotoids on the sphere and a lack of invariants that detect a diagram's planar nature. In this paper, we investigate equivalence of planar knotoids using quandle colorings and cocycle invariants. These quandle invariants are able to detect planarity by considering quandle colorings that are restricted at distinguished points in the diagram, namely the endpoints and the point-at-infinity. After defining these invariants we consider their applications to symmetry properties of planar knotoids such as invertibility and chirality. Furthermore we introduce an invariant called the triangular quandle cocycle invariant and show that it is a stronger invariant than the end specified quandle colorings.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Anosov flows from infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every pseudo-Anosov flow $\phi$ in a closed $3$-manifold $M$ gives rise to an action of $\pi_1(M)$ on a circle $S^{1}_{\infty}(\phi)$ from infinity \cite{Fen12}, with a pair of invariant \emph{almost} laminations. From certain actions on $S^{1}$ with invariant almost laminations, we reconstruct flows and manifolds realizing these actions, including all orientable transitive pseudo-Anosov flows in closed $3$-manifolds. Denoting the Poincar\'e disk by $\mathcal{D}$, our construction provides a geometry model for such flows $\phi$ and manifolds $M$ by identifying the universal coverings of $M$ with certain spaces induced from $\mathcal{D} \times \mathcal{D}$ and identifying the action of $\pi_1(M)$ on $S^{1}_{\infty}(\phi)$ with an action on $\partial \mathcal{D}$.</description>

      <title>Vign\'eras orbifolds: isospectrality, regulators, and torsion homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the isospectrality of the orbifolds constructed by Vign\'eras. We give fine sufficient criteria for i-isospectrality in given degree i and for representation equivalence. These allow us to produce very small exotic examples of isospectral orbifolds: hyperbolic 3-orbifolds that are i-isospectral for all i but not representation equivalent, hyperbolic 3-orbifolds that are 0-isospectral but not 1-isospectral, and others. Using the same method, we also give sufficient criteria for rationality of regulator quotients Reg_i(Y_1)^2/Reg_i(Y_2)^2 for Vign\'eras orbifolds Y_1, Y_2, sometimes even when they are not isospectral. Moreover, we establish a link between the primes that enter in these regulator quotients and at which torsion homology of Y_1 and Y_2 can differ, and Galois representations.</description>

      <title>Biracks: a notational proposal and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a notation for biracks that includes from the begining the knowledege of the associated (or underlying, or derived) rack structure. Motivated by results of Rump in the involutive case, this notation allows to generalize some results from involutive case to the non necessarily involutive solutions, and also to view some twisting constructions and its relation to the underlying rack structure in a more transparent way. Two applications are given.</description>

      <title>Geometry and dynamics of Hitchin grafting representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hitchin component of the character variety of representations of a surface group $\pi_1(S)$ into $\mathrm{PSL}_d(\mathbb R)$ for some $d\geq 3$ can be equipped with a pressure metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus equals the Weil-Petersson metric up to a constant factor. We show that if the genus of $S$ is at least $3$, then the Fuchsian locus contains quasi-convex subsets of infinite diameter for the Weil--Petersson metric whose diameter for the path metric of the pressure metric is finite. This is established through showing that biinfinite paths of bending deformations have controlled bounded length. To this end we give a geometric interpretation of Fock--Goncharov positivity and show that bending deformations of Fuchsian representations stabilize a uniform Finsler quasi-convex disk in the symmetric space $\mathrm{PSL}_d(\mathbb R)/\mathrm{PSO}(d)$.</description>

      <title>Square pegs between two graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there always exists an inscribed square in a Jordan curve given as the union of two graphs of functions of Lipschitz constant less than $1 + \sqrt{2}$. We are motivated by Tao's result that there exists such a square in the case of Lipschitz constant less than $1$. In the case of Lipschitz constant $1$, we show that the Jordan curve inscribes rectangles of every similarity class. Our approach involves analysing the change in the spectral invariants of the Jordan Floer homology under perturbations of the Jordan curve.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds from degree one graspers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We relate degree one grasper families of embedded circles to various constructions of diffeomorphisms found in the literature -- theta clasper classes of Watanabe, barbell implantations of Budney and Gabai, and twin twists of Gay and Hartman. We use a "parameterised surgery map" that for a smooth 4-manifold $X$ takes loops of embeddings of $S^1$ in the manifold obtained by surgery on some 2-sphere in $X$, to the mapping class group of $X$.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent results on diffeomorphisms, this paper investigates fundamental groups of spaces of embeddings of $S^1$ and $S^1\times D^3$ in 4-manifolds. We express the latter (framed) case in terms of the former, and study examples of the form $M\# S^1\times S^3$ in detail.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of composite symplectic Dehn twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper appears as the confluence of hyperbolic dynamics, symplectic topology and low dimensional topology, etc. We show that composite symplectic Dehn twists have certain form of nonuniform hyperbolicity: it has positive topological entropy as well as two families of local stable and unstable Lagrangian manifolds, which are analogous to signatures of pseudo Anosov mapping classes. Moreover, we show that the rank of the Floer cohomology group of these compositions grows exponentially under iterations, which partially answers a question of Smith concerning the classification of symplectic mapping class group in higher dimensions. Finally, we propose a conjecture on the positive metric entropy of our model and point out its relationship with the standard map.</description>

      <title>Non-concentration property of Patterson-Sullivan measures for Anosov subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group. For a Zariski dense Anosov subgroup $\Gamma&lt;G$ with respect to a parabolic subgroup $P_\theta$, we prove that any $\Gamma$-Patterson-Sullivan measure charges no mass on any proper subvariety of $G/P_\theta$. More generally, we prove that for a Zariski dense $\theta$-transverse subgroup $\Gamma&lt;G$, any $(\Gamma, \psi)$-Patterson-Sullivan measure charges no mass on any proper subvariety of $G/P_\theta$, provided the $\psi$-Poincar\'e series of $\Gamma$ diverges at $s=1$. In particular, our result also applies to relatively Anosov subgroups.</description>

      <title>Lattices, Gates, and Curves: GKP codes as a Rosetta stone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.</description>
