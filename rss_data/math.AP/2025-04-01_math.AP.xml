      <title>Global Well-Posedness and Blow-Up for the fifth order $L^2-$critical KP-I equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current paper, we investigate the fifth order modified KP-I eqaution, namely
  \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t u-\partial_{x}^{5}u-\partial_{x}^{-1}\partial_{y}u+\partial_{x}(u^3)=0.
  \end{equation*}
  This equation is $L^2$ critical and we prove on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ that it is globally well posed in the natural energy space if the $L^2$ norm of the initial data is less the $L^2$ norm of the ground state associated to this equation. We also find a subspace of the natural energy space associated to this equation where we have local well-posedness, nevertheless if the initial data is sufficiently localized we obtain blow-up. On $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T},$ we prove global well-posedness in the energy space for small data.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering for the multipoint potentials of Bethe-Peierls-Thomas-Fermi type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger equation with a multipoint potential of the Bethe-Peierls-Thomas-Fermi type. We show that such a potential in dimension d=2 or d=3 is uniquely determined by its scattering amplitude at a fixed positive energy. Moreover, we show that there is no non-zero potential of this type with zero scattering amplitude at a fixed positive energy and a fixed incident direction. Nevertheless, we also show that a multipoint potential of this type is not uniquely determined by its scattering amplitude at a positive energy E and a fixed incident direction. Our proofs also contribute to the theory of inverse source problem for the Helmholtz equation with multipoint source.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, for 2nd order PDEs with periodic boundary conditions, the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$ is nontrivial on the PDE domain, and solutions may converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in this nullspace. To test this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how we can model these trajectories for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any function $\mathbf{u}(t)$ in the PDE domain can be decomposed into a component defined by $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$, and a component $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$ existing in the nullspace of $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$ and $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined for trajectories $\mathbf{u}^*(t)=\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$, and it is shown that stability of these trajectories as well as of the equilibrium $\mathbf{u}^*\equiv0$ can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of exponential decay.</description>

      <title>Dissipative structure of higher order regularizations of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in several space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the dissipative structure of regularizations of any order of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in several space dimensions. It is proved that the seminal equivalence theorem by Kawashima and Shizuta (Hokkaido Math. J. 14, 1985, no. 2, 249-275), which relates the strictly dissipative structure of second-order (viscous) systems to a genuine coupling condition of algebraic type, can be extended to higher-order multidimensional systems. For that purpose, the symbolic formulation of the genuine coupling condition by Humpherys (J. Hyperbolic Differ. Equ. 2, 2005, no. 4, 963-974) for linear operators of any order in one dimension, is adopted and extrapolated. Therefore, the concepts of symbol symmetrizability and genuine coupling are extended to the most general setting of differential operators of any order in several space dimensions. Applications to many viscous-dispersive systems of physical origin, such as compressible viscous-capillar fluids of Korteweg type, the dispersive Navier-Stokes-Fourier system and the equations of quantum hydrodynamics, illustrate the relevance of this extension.</description>

      <title>On the second anisotropic Cheeger constant and related questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of the second eigenfunction of the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator \[ - Q_{p}u:=-\textrm{div} \left(F^{p-1}(\nabla u)F_\xi (\nabla u)\right), \] as $p \to 1^+$, where $F$ is a suitable smooth norm of $\mathbb R^{n}$. Moreover, for any regular set $\Omega$, we define the second anisotropic Cheeger constant as \begin{equation*} h_{2,F}(\Omega):=\inf \left\{ \max\left\{\frac{P_{F}(E_{1})}{|E_{1}|},\frac{P_{F}(E_{2})}{|E_{2}|}\right\},\; E_{1},E_{2}\subset \Omega, E_{1}\cap E_{2}=\emptyset\right\}, \end{equation*} where $P_{F}(E)$ is the anisotropic perimeter of $E$, and study the connection with the second eigenvalue of the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian. Finally, we study the twisted anisotropic $q$-Cheeger constant with a volume constraint.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic energies for the variational modeling of cavitation in nonlinear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of minimizers for free-discontinuity functionals in nonlinear elasticity, where discontinuities correspond to the phenomenon of cavitation. The energy comprises two terms: a volume term accounting for the elastic energy; and a surface term concentrated on the boundaries of the cavities in the deformed configuration that depends on their unit normal. While the treatment of the first term in standard, that of the second one relies on the regularity of inverse deformations, their weak continuity properties, and Ambriosio's lower semicontinuity theorem for special functions of bounded variation.</description>

      <title>Blow-up and global mild solutions for a Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equation on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the existence of global and blow-up solutions for the nonlinear parabolic problem described by the Hardy-H\'enon equation $u_t - \Delta_{\mathbb{H}} u = |\cdot|_{\mathbb{H}}^{\gamma} u^p \mbox{ in } \mathbb{H}^N \times (0,T),$ where $\mathbb{H}^N$ is the $N$-dimensional Heisenberg group, and the singular term $|\cdot|_{\mathbb{H}}^{\gamma}$ is given by the Kor\'anyi norm. Our study focuses on nonnegative solutions. We establish that for $\gamma\geq 0$, the Fujita critical exponent is $p_c = 1+ (2+\gamma)/Q$, where $Q=2N+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{H}^N$. For $\gamma&lt;0$, the solutions blow up for $1&lt;p&lt;1+ (2+\gamma)/Q$, while global solutions exist for $p&gt;1+ (2+\gamma)/(Q + \gamma )$. In particular, our results coincide with the results found by Georgiev and Palmieri in \cite{PALMIERI} for $\gamma=0$.</description>

      <title>A Regularity Theory for Stationary Two-valued Harmonic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For stationary two-valued harmonic functions with H\"older regularity, we establish their Lipschitz regularity and prove that the nodal set consists of analytic hypersurfaces away from a singular set. The main tools are the Almgren monotonicity formula and the blow-up method. These results are applicable to some limiting problems in segregation models.</description>

      <title>On the 2D Plasma-Vacuum Interface Problems for Ideal Incompressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the two-dimensional plasma-vacuum interface problems for ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, which describe the dynamics of perfect conducting fluids in a vacuum region under the influence of magnetic fields. We establish their local well-posedness theories in standard Sobolev spaces, under the hypothesis that either there exist capillary forces or the total magnetic fields are non-degenerate on the free boundary. We also show vanishing surface tension limits under either the non-degeneracy assumption on magnetic fields or the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition on the effective pressure. These results indicate that both capillary forces and non-degenerate tangential magnetic fields can indeed stabilize the motion of the plasma-vacuum interface, which, in particular, give another interpretations to the ill-posed examples constructed by C. Hao and the second author (Comm. Math. Phys. 376 (2020), 259-286). Although the initial data provided there are highly-unstable/ill-posed in the Sobolev spaces characterizing regularities of flow maps, plasma-vacuum problems with these initial data can still be stable/well-posed in suitable standard Sobolev spaces in the Eulerian framework without involving flow maps.</description>

      <title>On the weak Sard Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $f\colon [0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ is of class $C^2$ then Sard's theorem implies that $f$ has the following relaxed Sard property: the image under $f$ of the Lebesgue measure restricted to the critical set of $f$ is a singular measure. We show that for $C^{1,\alpha}$ functions with $\alpha&lt;1$ this property is strictly stronger than the weak Sard property introduced by Alberti, Bianchini and Crippa, while for any monotone continuous function these two properties are equivalent.
  We also show that even in the one-dimensional setting H\"older regularity is not sufficient for the relaxed Sard property.</description>

      <title>Global boundedness and finite time blow-up of solutions for a quasilinear chemotaxis-May-Nowak model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the nonlinear diffusion term $\nabla\cdot(D(u)\nabla u)$ into the chemotaxis-May-Nowak model to investigate the effects of $D(u)$ and chemotaxis on the global existence, boundedness, and finite time blow-up of solutions. Here, $D(u)$ generalizes the prototype $(1+u)^{m-1}$ with $m\in\R$. For the parabolic-elliptic-parabolic case, if $m&gt;2+\frac{n}{2}-\frac2{n}$ when $n\ge3$ and $m&gt;\frac32$ when $n=2$, then all solutions exist globally and remain bounded, whereas if $n\in\{2,3\}$ and $m&lt;1$, finite time blow-up occurs when $\Omega$ is a ball and the initial data are radially symmetric. For the fully parabolic case, if $m&gt;1+\frac{n}{2}-\frac2{n}$, then all solutions exist globally and remain bounded.</description>

      <title>Energy identity for Ginzburg-Landau approximation of harmonic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two Riemannian manifolds $M$ and $N\subset\mathbb{R}^L$, we consider the energy concentration phenomena of the penalized energy functional $$E_{\epsilon}(u)=\int_M\frac{\vert\nabla u\vert^2}{2}+\frac{F(u)}{\epsilon^2},u\in W^{1,2}(M,\mathbb{R}^L),$$ where $F(x)$=dist$(x,N)$ in a small tubular neighborhood of $N$ and is constant away from $N$. It was shown by Chen-Struwe that as $\epsilon\rightarrow0$, the critical points $u_{\epsilon}$ of $E_{\epsilon}$ with energy bound $E_{\epsilon}(u_{\epsilon})\leqslant\Lambda$ subsequentially converge weakly in $W^{1,2}$ to a weak harmonic map $u:M\rightarrow N$ . In addition, we have the convergence of the energy density $$\left(\frac{\vert\nabla u_{\epsilon}\vert^2}{2}+\frac{F(u_{\epsilon})}{\epsilon^2}\right)dx\rightarrow\frac{\vert\nabla u_{\epsilon}\vert^2}{2}dx+\nu,$$ and the defect measure $\nu$ above is $(dimM-2)$-rectifiable. Lin-Wang showed that if $N$ is a sphere or dim$M$=2, then the density of $\nu$ can be expressed by the sum of energies of harmonic spheres. In this paper, we prove this result for an arbitrary $M$ using the idea introduced by Naber-Valtorta.</description>

      <title>On blowup solution in NLS equation under dispersion or nonlinearity management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dispersion-managed nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DM-NLS) equation $$ i\partial_t u(t,x)+\gamma(t)\Delta u(t,x)=|u(t,x)|^{\frac4d}u(t,x),\quad x\in\R^d, $$ and the nonlinearity-managed NLS (NM-NLS) equation: $$ i\partial_t u(t,x)+\Delta u(t,x)=\gamma(t)|u(t,x)|^{\frac4d}u(t,x), \quad x\in\R^d, $$ where $\gamma(t)$ is a periodic function which is equal to $-1$ when $t\in (0,1]$ and is equal to $1$ when $t\in (1,2]$. The two models share the feature that the focusing and defocusing effects convert periodically. For the classical focusing NLS, it is known that the initial data $$ u_0(x)=T^{-\frac{d}{2}}\fe^{i\frac{|x|^2}{4T} -i\frac{\omega^2}{T}}Q_\omega\left(\frac{x}{T}\right) $$ leads to a blowup solution $$(T-t)^{-\frac{d}{2}}\fe^{i\frac{|x|^2}{4(T-t)} -i\frac{\omega^2}{T-t}}Q_\omega\left(\frac{x}{T-t}\right), $$ so when $T\leq1$, this is also a blowup solution for DM-NLS and NM-NLS which blows up in the first focusing layer.
  For DM-NLS, we prove that when $T&gt;1$, the initial data $u_0$ above does not lead to a finite-time blowup and the corresponding solution is globally well-posed. For NM-NLS, we prove the global well-posedness for $T\in(1,2)$ and we construct solution that can blow up at any focusing layer. The theoretical studies are complemented by extensive numerical explorations towards understanding the stabilization effects in the two models and addressing their difference.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to presenting a rigorous mathematical derivation for the classical phenomenon in Maxwell's theory that a charged particle moves along a straight line in a constant electromagnetic field if the initial velocity is parallel to the constant electromagnetic field. The particle is modeled by scaled solitons to a class of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations and the nonlinear interaction between the charged particle and the electromagnetic field is governed by the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system. We show that when the size and amplitude of the particle are sufficiently small, the solution to the coupled nonlinear system exists up to any given time and the energy of the particle concentrates along a straight line. The method relies on the modulation approach for the study of stability for solitons and weighted energy estimates for the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of plane ideal flows in a periodic channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish two stability theorems for steady or traveling solutions of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equation in a finite periodic channel, extending Arnold's classical work from the 1960s. Compared to Arnold's approach, we employ a compactness argument rather than relying on the negative definiteness of the energy-Casimir functional. The isovortical property of the Euler equation and Burton's rearrangement theory play an essential role in our analysis. As a corollary, we prove for the first time the existence of a class of stable non-shear flows when the ratio of the channel's height to its length is less than or equal to $\sqrt{3}/2.$ Two rigidity results are also obtained as byproducts.</description>

      <title>Quenching phenomena in a system of non-local diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the quenching phenomena occurring in a non-local diffusion system of two equations with intertwined singular absorption terms of the type $u^{-p}$. We prove that there exists a range of multiplicative parameters for which every solution presents quenching, while outside this range there are both global and quenching solutions. We also characterize in terms of the exponents of the absorption terms when the quenching is simultaneous or non-simultaneous and obtain the quenching rates.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the 3D Navier-Stokes Equations under Multi-Level Logarithmically Improved Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends our previous results on logarithmically improved regularity criteria for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations by establishing a comprehensive framework of multi-level logarithmic improvements. We prove that if the initial data $u_0 \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ satisfies a nested logarithmically weakened condition $\|(-\Delta)^{s/2}u_0\|_{L^q(\mathbb{R}^3)} \leq \frac{C_0}{\prod_{j=1}^{n} (1 + L_j(\|u_0\|_{\dot{H}^s}))^{\delta_j}}$ for some $s \in (1/2, 1)$, where $L_j$ represents $j$-fold nested logarithms, then the corresponding solution exists globally in time and is unique. The proof introduces a novel sequence of increasingly precise commutator estimates incorporating multiple layers of logarithmic corrections. We establish the existence of a critical threshold function $\Phi(s,q,\{\delta_j\}_{j=1}^n)$ that completely characterizes the boundary between global regularity and potential singularity formation, with explicit asymptotics as $s$ approaches the critical value $1/2$. This paper further provides a rigorous geometric characterization of potential singular structures through refined multi-fractal analysis, showing that any singular set must have Hausdorff dimension bounded by $1 - \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\delta_j}{1+\delta_j} \cdot \frac{1}{j+1}$. Our results constitute a significant advancement toward resolving the global regularity question for the Navier-Stokes equations, as we demonstrate that with properly calibrated sequences of nested logarithmic improvements, the gap to the critical case can be systematically reduced.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics and Blow Up in a Model of Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study a one dimensional model for Magnetic Relaxation. This model was introduced by Moffatt and describes a low resistivity viscous plasma, in which the pressure and the inercia are much smaller than the magnetic pressure. In the limit of resistivity $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, we prove the existence of two time scales for the evolution of the magnetic field: a fast one for times of order $\log(\varepsilon^{-1})$ in which the resistivity plays no role and the energy is dissipated only via viscosity; and a slow one for times of order $\varepsilon^{-1}$ characterized by the influence of the resistivity. We show that in this second time scale, as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, the modulus of magnetic field approaches a function that depends only on time. We also prove that, in this regime, the magnetic field $b_\varepsilon(t,x)$ can be approximated as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ by the solution of a PDE whose solutions exhibit blow up for some choices of initial data.</description>

      <title>A Poho\v{z}aev minimization for normalized solutions: fractional sublinear equations of logarithmic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we search for normalized solutions to a fractional, nonlinear, and possibly strongly sublinear Schr\"odinger equation $$(-\Delta)^s u + \mu u = g(u) \quad \hbox{in $\mathbb{R}^N$},$$ under the mass constraint $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u^2 \, \mathrm{d}x = m&gt;0$; here, $N\geq 2$, $s \in (0,1)$, and $\mu$ is a Lagrange multiplier. We study the case of $L^2$-subcritical nonlinearities $g$ of Berestycki--Lions type, without assuming that $g$ is superlinear at the origin, which allows us to include examples like a logarithmic term $g(u)= u\log(u^2)$ or sublinear powers $g(u)=u^q-u^r$, $0&lt;r&lt;1&lt;q$. Due to the generality of $g$ and the fact that the energy functional might be not well-defined, we implement an approximation process in combination with a Lagrangian approach and a new Poho\v{z}aev minimization in the product space, finding a solution for large values of $m$. In the sublinear case, we are able to find a solution for each $m$. Several insights on the concepts of minimality are studied as well. We highlight that some of the results are new even in the local setting $s=1$ or for $g$ superlinear.</description>

      <title>Wave turbulence for a semilinear Klein-Gordon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider a system of two Klein-Gordon equations, set on the $d$-dimensional box of size $L$, coupled through quadratic semilinear terms of strength $\varepsilon$ and evolving from well-prepared random initial data. We rigorously derive the effective dynamics for the correlations associated to the solution, in the limit where $L\to\infty$ and $\varepsilon\to 0$ according to some power law. The main novelty of our work is that, due to the absence of invariances, trivial resonances always take precedence over quasi-resonances. The derivation of the nonlinear effective dynamics is justified up time to $\delta T$ , where $T =\varepsilon^{-2}$ is the appropriate timescale and $\delta$ is independent of $L$ and $\varepsilon$. We use Feynmann interaction diagrams, here adapted to a normal form reduction and to the coupled nature of our real-valued system. We also introduce a frequency decomposition at the level of the diagrammatic and develop a new combinatorial tool which allows us to work with the Klein-Gordon dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Many facets of cohomology: Differential complexes and structure-aware formulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Integral Asymptotics, Coalescing Saddles, and Multiple-scales Analysis of a Generalised Swift-Hohenberg Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integral asymptotics play an important role in the analysis of differential equations and in a variety of other settings. In this work, we apply an integral asymptotics approach to study spatially localized solutions of a heterogeneous generalised Swift-Hohenberg equation. The outer solution is obtained via WKBJ asymptotics, while the inner solution requires the method of coalescing saddles. We modify the classic method of Chester et al. to account for additional technicalities, such as complex branch selection and local transformation to a cubic polynomial. By integrating our results, we construct an approximate global solution to the generalised Swift-Hohenberg problem and validate it against numerical contour integral solutions. We also demonstrate an alternative approach that circumvents the complexity of integral asymptotics by analyzing the original differential equation directly through a multiple-scales analysis and show that this generates the same leading-order inner solution obtained using the coalescing saddles method at least for one of the cases considered via integral asymptotics. Our findings reinforce the significance of integral asymptotics in approximating the fourth order differential equations found in the linear stability analysis for generalisations of the Swift Hohenberg equations. This study has also highlighted a conjecture that, in certain cases, the method of coalescing saddles can be systematically replaced by multiple-scales analysis using an intermediary differential equation, a hypothesis for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a $\gamma$ dimensional measure embedded in an $N$ dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in $N$ dimensions and projected into $D$ dimensions.
  It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected $\gamma$ dimensional measure is $P_j \propto 2^{-j\gamma}$. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, $N$, and the projected dimension, $D$. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space.
  Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from $\gamma = 1.7$ for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to $\gamma = 2.5$ for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyse a finite volume scheme for a nonlocal active matter system known to exhibit a rich array of complex behaviours. The model under investigation was derived from a stochastic system of interacting particles describing a foraging ant colony coupled to pheromone dynamics. In this work, we prove that the unique numerical solution converges to the unique weak solution as the mesh size and the time step go to zero. We also show discrete long-time estimates, which prove that certain norms are preserved for all times, uniformly in the mesh size and time step. In particular, we prove higher regularity estimates which provide an analogue of continuum parabolic higher regularity estimates. Finally, we numerically study the rate of convergence of the scheme, and we provide examples of the existence of multiple metastable steady states.</description>

      <title>Generic linearized curvature singularity at the perturbed Kerr Cauchy horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the precise asymptotics of the spin $-2$ Teukolsky field in the interior and along the Cauchy horizon of a subextremal Kerr black hole. Together with the oscillatory blow-up asymptotics of the spin $+2$ Teukolsky field proven in our previous work arXiv:2409.02670, our result suggests that generic perturbations of a Kerr black hole build up to form a coordinate-independent curvature singularity at the Cauchy horizon. This supports the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in Kerr spacetimes. Unlike in the spin $+2$ case, the spin $-2$ Teukolsky field is regular on the Cauchy horizon and the first term in its asymptotic development vanishes. As a result, the derivation of a precise lower bound for the spin $-2$ field is more delicate than in the spin $+2$ case, and relies on a novel ODE method based on a decomposition of the Teukolsky operator between radial and time derivatives.</description>

      <title>Compressible N-phase fluid mixture models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid mixture models are essential for describing a wide range of physical phenomena, including wave dynamics and spinodal decomposition. However, there is a lack of consensus in the modeling of compressible mixtures, with limited connections between different classes of models. On the one hand, existing compressible two-phase flow models accurately describe wave dynamics, but do not incorporate phase separation mechanisms. On the other hand, phase-field technology in fluid dynamics consists of models incorporating spinodal decomposition, however, a general phase-field theory for compressible mixtures remains largely undeveloped.
  In this paper, we take an initial step toward bridging the gap between compressible two-phase flow models and phase-field models by developing a theory for compressible, isothermal N-phase mixtures. Our theory establishes a system of reduced complexity by formulating N mass balance laws alongside a single momentum balance law, thereby naturally extending the Navier-Stokes Korteweg model to N-phases and providing the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn model for compressible mixtures. Key aspects of the framework include its grounding in continuum mixture theory and its preservation of thermodynamic consistency despite its reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Davenport-Heilbronn Function Ratio Properties and Non-Trivial Zeros Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the analytic properties of the ratio $f(s)/f(1-s) = X(s)$ based on the Davenport-Heilbronn functional equation $f(s) = X(s)f(1-s)$. We propose a novel method to analyze the distribution of non-trivial zeros through the monotonicity of the ratio $|f(s)/f(1-s)|$. Rigorously proving that non-trivial zeros can only lie on the critical line $\sigma=1/2$, we highlight two groundbreaking findings: 1. Contradiction of Off-Critical Zeros: Numerical "exceptional zeros" (e.g., Spira, 1994) violate the theoretical threshold $\kappa=1.21164$ and conflict with the monotonicity constraint of $|X(s)|=1$. 2. Essential Difference Between Approximate and Strict Zeros: Points satisfying $f(s) \to 0$ do not constitute strict zeros unless verified by analyticity. This work provides a new perspective for studying zero distributions of $L$-functions related to the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Several isoperimetric inequalities of Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by mainly using the rearrangement technique and suitably constructing trial functions, under the constraint of fixed weighted volume, we can successfully obtain several isoperimetric inequalities for the first and the second Dirichlet eigenvalues, the first nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in space forms. These spectral isoperimetric inequalities extend those classical ones (i.e. the Faber-Krahn inequality, the Hong-Krahn-Szeg\H{o} inequality and the Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality) of the Laplacian.</description>

      <title>On classification of global dynamics for energy-critical equivariant harmonic map heat flows and radial nonlinear heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the global dynamics of finite energy solutions to energy-critical equivariant harmonic map heat flow (HMHF) and radial nonlinear heat equation (NLH). It is known that any finite energy equivariant solutions to (HMHF) decompose into finitely many harmonic maps (bubbles) separated by scales and a body map, as approaching to the maximal time of existence. Our main result for (HMHF) gives a complete classification of their dynamics for equivariance indices $D\geq3$; (i) they exist globally in time, (ii) the number of bubbles and signs are determined by the energy class of the initial data, and (iii) the scales of bubbles are asymptotically given by a universal sequence of rates up to scaling symmetry. In parallel, we also obtain a complete classification of $\dot{H}^{1}$-bounded radial solutions to (NLH) in dimensions $N\geq7$, building upon soliton resolution for such solutions. To our knowledge, this provides the first rigorous classification of bubble tree dynamics within symmetry. We introduce a new approach based on the energy method that does not rely on maximum principle. The key ingredient of the proof is a monotonicity estimate near any bubble tree configurations, which in turn requires a delicate construction of modified multi-bubble profiles also.</description>

Abstract: Moving from the seminal papers by Bobkov and Tanaka \cite{BT,BT2,BT3} on the spectrum of the $(p,q)$-Laplacian, we analyze the case of the double-phase operator. We discuss the region of parameters in which existence and non-existence of positive solutions occur. The proofs are based on normalization procedures, the Nehari manifold, and truncation techniques, exploiting Picone-type inequalities and an ad-hoc strong maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Serrin's overdetermined problem in rough domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Serrin's overdetermined theorem states that a $C^2$ bounded domain, which admits a function with constant Laplacian that satisfies both constant Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, must necessarily be a ball. While extensions of this theorem to non-smooth domains have been explored since the 1990s, the applicability of Serrin's theorem to Lipschitz domains remained unresolved. This paper answers this open question affirmatively. Actually, our approach shows that the result holds for domains that are sets of finite perimeter with a uniform upper bound on the density, and it also allows for slit discontinuities.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time asymptotic behaviour of a topologically non-trivial network of wave and heat equations. By analysing the simpler wave and the heat networks separately, and then applying recent results for abstract coupled systems, we establish energy decay at the rate $t^{-4}$ as $t\to\infty$ for all classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of composite waves of two viscous shocks for relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the time asymptotic stability of composite waves formed by two shock waves within the context of one-dimensional relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We demonstrate that the composite waves consisting of two viscous shocks achieve asymptotic nonlinear stability under the condition of having two small, independent wave strengths and the presence of minor initial perturbations. Furthermore, the solutions of the relaxed system are observed to globally converge over time to those of the classical system as the relaxation parameter approaches zero. The methodologies are grounded in relative entropy, the $a$-contraction with shifts theory and fundamental energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear orbital stability of stationary discrete shock profiles for scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For scalar conservation laws, we prove that spectrally stable stationary Lax discrete shock profiles are nonlinearly stable in some polynomially-weighted $\ell^1$ and $\ell^\infty$ spaces. In comparison with several previous nonlinear stability results on discrete shock profiles, we avoid the introduction of any weakness assumption on the amplitude of the shock and apply our analysis to a large family of schemes that introduce some artificial possibly high-order viscosity. The proof relies on a precise description of the Green's function of the linearization of the numerical scheme about spectrally stable discrete shock profiles obtained in [Coeu25]. The present article also pinpoints the ideas for a possible extension of this nonlinear orbital stability result for discrete shock profiles in the case of systems of conservation laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the energy-critical nonlinear heat equation in critical spaces for any dimension greater or equal than three. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition on initial data at or below the ground state that dichotomizes the behavior of solutions. Specifically, this criterion determines whether the solution will either exist globally with energy decaying to zero over time or blow up in finite time. Secondly, we derive the decay rate for solutions that exist globally. These results offer a comprehensive characterization of solution behavior for energy-critical conditions in higher-dimensional settings</description>

      <title>Dafermos' principle and Brenier's duality scheme for defocusing dispersive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover an abstract structure behind several nonlinear dispersive equations (including the NLS, NLKG and GKdV equations with generic defocusing power-law nonlinearities) that is reminiscent of hyperbolic conservation laws. The underlying abstract problem admits an "entropy" that is formally conserved. The entropy is determined by a strictly convex function that naturally generates an anisotropic Orlicz space. For such problems, we introduce the dual matrix-valued variational formulation in the spirit of [Y. Brenier. Comm. Math. Phys. (2018) 364(2) 579-605]. Employing time-adaptive weights, we are able to prove consistency of the duality scheme on large time intervals. We also prove solvability of the dual problem in the corresponding anisotropic Orlicz spaces. As an application, we show that no subsolution of the PDEs that fit into our framework is able to dissipate the total entropy earlier or faster than the strong solution on the interval of existence of the latter. This result (we call it Dafermos' principle) is new even for "isotropic" problems such as the incompressible Euler system.</description>

      <title>Nonradial stability of self-similar blowup to Keller-Segel equation in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In three dimensions, the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system exhibits a rich variety of singularity formations. Notably, it admits an explicit self-similar blow-up solution whose radial stability, conjectured more than two decades ago in [Brenner-Constantin-Kadanoff-Schenkel-Venkataramani, 1999], was recently confirmed by [Glogi\'c-Sch\"orkhuber, 2024]. This paper aims to extend the radial stability to the nonradial setting, building on the finite-codimensional stability analysis in our previous work [Li-Zhou, 2024]. The main input is the mode stability of the linearized operator, whose nonlocal nature presents essential challenges for the spectral analysis. Besides a quantitative perturbative analysis for the high spherical classes, we adapt in the first spherical class the wave operator method of [Li-Wei-Zhang, 2020] for the fluid stability to localize the operator and remove the known unstable mode simultaneously. Our method provides localization beyond the partial mass variable and is independent of the explicit formula of the profile, so it potentially sheds light on other linear nonlocal problems.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann equations with neutral initial data and small relative entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of dilute plasma particles such as electrons and ions can be modeled by the fundamental two species Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann equations, which describes mutual interactions of plasma particles through collisions in the self-induced electric field. In this paper, we are concerned with global well-posedness of mild solutions to these equations. We establish the global existence and uniqueness of mild solutions to the two species Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann equations on the torus for a class of initial data with bounded time-velocity-weighted $L^{\infty}$ norm under a nearly neutral condition, along with smallness conditions on the $L^1_xL^\infty_v$ norm and defects in mass, energy and entropy. These conditions allow the initial data to exhibit large amplitude oscillations. Due to the nonlinear effect of electric field, we consider the problem in $W^{1, \infty}_{x,v}$ with large amplitude data, new difficulty arises when establishing globally uniform $W^{1, \infty}_{x,v}$ bound, which has been overcome based on nearly neutral condition, time-velocity weight function and a logarithmic estimate. Moreover,the long-time behavior of solutions in $W^{1, \infty}_{x,v}$ norm, with exponential decay rates of convergence, is also obtained.</description>

Abstract: We prove global well-posedness for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for periodic initial data in the mass-critical dimension $d=2$ for initial data of arbitrary size in the defocusing case and data below the ground state threshold in the focusing case. The result is based on a new inverse Strichartz inequality, which is proved by using incidence geometry and additive combinatorics, in particular the inverse theorems for Gowers uniformity norms by Green-Tao-Ziegler. This allows to transfer the analogous results of Dodson for the non-periodic mass-critical NLS to the periodic setting. In addition, we construct an approximate periodic solution which implies sharpness of the results.</description>

      <title>A new framework for Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory and its application to planar Choquard equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the planar logarithmic Choquard equation $$- \Delta u + a(x)u + (\log|\cdot| \ast u^2)u = 0,\qquad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^2$$ in the strongly indefinite and possibly degenerate setting where no sign condition is imposed on the linear potential $a \in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2)$. In particular, we shall prove the existence of a sequence of high energy solutions to this problem in the case where $a$ is invariant under $\mathbb{Z}^2$-translations.
  The result extends to a more general $G$-equivariant setting, for which we develop a new variational approach which allows us to find critical points of Ljusternik-Schnirelmann type. In particular, our method resolves the problem that the energy functional $\Phi$ associated with the logarithmic Choquard equation is only defined on a subspace $X \subset H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with the property that $\|\cdot\|_X$ is not translation invariant. The new approach is based on a new $G$-equivariant version of the Cerami condition and on deformation arguments adapted to a family of suitably constructed scalar products $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_u$, $u \in X$ with the $G$-equivariance property $\langle g \ast v , g \ast w \rangle_{g \ast u} = \langle v , w \rangle_u.$</description>

      <title>Decay of solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of small and large solutions to a broad class of nonlinear Dirac-type equations. Our results are classified in 1D massless and massive cases, 3D general and $n$ dimensional in generality. In the 1D massless case we prove that any globally defined solution converges to zero as time tends to infinity, within a spatial region expanding at a rate proportional to $ t \log^{-2} t$. This result holds without assumptions on the smallness of initial data or specific power of nonlinearity, ruling out the existence of standing breather-like or solitary wave structures in this regime. In the 1D massive case, solitary waves are known to exist. Introducing new virial identities adapted to the Dirac's distinctive algebra, we prove that there are ``holomorphic'' odd nonlinearities under which globally defined small odd solutions decay to zero on spatial compact sets as time tends to infinity. This result is extended to the 3D case under boundedness of the $H^1$ norm but without requiring the parity condition on the data, giving decay proofs for an important class of nonlinear Dirac models, and opening the door to the future use of virial identities to prove asymptotic stability of well-chosen Dirac solitary waves.
  Finally, in higher dimensions $ n \geq 1$, we prove the $L^2$ decay for global solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations in the ``exterior light-cone'' region. This confirms the non-existence of breathers and other solutions propagating faster than the speed of light. Our proofs rely on carefully constructed weighted virial identities.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stability in Fractional Hardy-Sobolev Inequalities: The Role of Euler-Lagrange Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates sharp stability estimates for the fractional Hardy-Sobolev inequality: $$\mu_{s,t}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right) \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{|u|^{2^*_s(t)}}{|x|^t} \,{\rm d}x \right)^{\frac{2}{2^*_s(t)}} \leq \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \left|(-\Delta)^{\frac{s}{2}} u \right|^2 \,{\rm d}x, \quad \text{for all } u \in \dot{H}^s\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right),$$ where $N &gt; 2s$, $s \in (0,1)$, $0 &lt; t &lt; 2s &lt; N $, and $2^*_s(t) = \frac{2(N-t)}{N-2s}$. Here, $\mu_{s,t}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)$ represents the best constant in the inequality.
  The paper focuses on the quantitative stability results of the above inequality and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation near a positive ground-state solution. Additionally, a qualitative stability result is established for the Euler-Lagrange equation, offering a thorough characterization of the Palais-Smale sequences for the associated energy functional. These results generalize the sharp quantitative stability results for the classical Sobolev inequality in $\mathbb{R}^N$, originally obtained by Bianchi and Egnell \cite{BE91} as well as the corresponding critical exponent problem in $\mathbb{R}^N$, explored by Ciraolo, Figalli, and Maggi \cite{CFM18} in the framework of fractional calculus.</description>

      <title>Extension theory via boundary triplets for infinite-dimensional implicit port-Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution of constrained linear partial-differential equations can be described via parametric representations of linear relations. To study these representations, we provide a novel definition of boundary triplets for linear relations in range representations where the associated boundary map is defined on the domain of the parameterizing operators rather than the relation itself. This allows us to characterize all boundary conditions such that the underlying dynamics is represented by a self-adjoint, skew-adjoint or maximally dissipative relation. The theoretical results are applied to a class of implicit port-Hamiltonian systems on one-dimensional spatial domains. More precisely, we explicitly construct a boundary triplet which solely depends on the coefficient matrices of the involved matrix differential operators and we derive the associated Lagrangian subspace. We exemplify our approach by means of the Dzektser equation, the biharmonic wave equation, and an elastic rod with non-local elasticity condition.</description>

      <title>Stabilization by transport noise and enhanced dissipation in the Kraichnan model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.03949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilization and sufficient conditions for mixing by stochastic transport are shown. More precisely, given a second order linear operator with possibly unstable eigenvalues on a smooth compact Riemannian manifold, it is shown that the inclusion of transport noise can imply global asymptotic stability. Moreover, it is shown that an arbitrary large exponential rate of convergence can be reached, implying enhanced dissipation. The sufficient conditions are shown to be satisfied by the so-called Kraichnan model for stochastic transport of passive scalars in turbulent fluids. In addition, an example is given showing that it can be sufficient to force four modes in order to induce stabilization.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantization with branched optimal transport distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal approximation of a target measure by an atomic measure with $N$ atoms, in branched optimal transport distance. This is a new branched transport version of optimal quantization problems. New difficulties arise, since in classical semi-discrete optimal transport with Wasserstein distance, the interfaces between cells associated with neighboring atoms have Voronoi structure and satisfy an explicit description. This description is missing for our problem, in which the cell interfaces are thought to have fractal boundary. We study the asymptotic behaviour of optimal quantizers for absolutely continuous measures as the number $N$ of atoms grows to infinity. We compute the limit distribution of the corresponding point clouds and show in particular a branched transport version of Zador's theorem. Moreover, we establish uniformity bounds of optimal quantizers in terms of separation distance and covering radius of the atoms, when the measure is $d$-Ahlfors regular. A crucial technical tool is the uniform in $N$ H\"older regularity of the landscape function, a branched transport analog to Kantorovich potentials in classical optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Stability of abstract coupled systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stability of abstract differential equations coupled by means of a general algebraic condition. Our approach is based on techniques from operator theory and systems theory, and it allows us to study coupled systems by exploiting properties of the components, which are typically much simpler to analyse. As our main results we establish resolvent estimates and decay rates for abstract boundary-coupled systems. We illustrate the power of the general results by using them to obtain rates of energy decay in coupled systems of one-dimensional wave and heat equations, and in a wave equation with an acoustic boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Weak uniqueness for singular stochastic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We put forward a new method for proving weak uniqueness of stochastic equations with singular drifts driven by a non-Markov or infinite-dimensional noise. We apply our method to study stochastic heat equation (SHE) driven by Gaussian space-time white noise $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u_t(x)=\frac12 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}u_t(x)+b(u_t(x))+\dot{W}_{t}(x), \quad t&gt;0,\, x\in D\subset\mathbb{R}, $$ and multidimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by fractional Brownian motion with the Hurst index $H\in(0,1/2)$ $$ d X_t=b(X_t) dt +d B_t^H,\quad t&gt;0. $$ In both cases $b$ is a generalized function in the Besov space $\mathcal{B}^\alpha_{\infty,\infty}$, $\alpha&lt;0$. Well-known pathwise uniqueness results for these equations do not cover the entire range of the parameter $\alpha$, for which weak existence holds. What happens in the range where weak existence holds but pathwise uniqueness is unknown has been an open problem. We settle this problem and show that for SHE weak uniqueness holds for $\alpha&gt;-3/2$, and for SDE it holds for $\alpha&gt;1/2-1/(2H)$; thus, in both cases, it holds in the entire desired range of values of $\alpha$. This extends seminal results of Catellier and Gubinelli (2016) and Gy\"ongy and Pardoux (1993) to the weak well-posedness setting. To establish these results, we develop a new strategy, combining ideas from ergodic theory (generalized couplings of Hairer-Mattingly-Kulik-Scheutzow) with stochastic sewing of L\^e.</description>

      <title>Inf-sup theory for the quasi-static Biot's equations in poroelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the two-field formulation of the quasi-static Biot's equations in bounded domains by means of the inf-sup theory. For this purpose, we exploit an equivalent four-field formulation of the equations, introducing the so-called total pressure and total fluid content as independent variables. We establish existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution. Our stability estimate is two-sided and robust, meaning that the regularity established for the solution matches the regularity requirements for the data and the involved constants are independent of all material parameters. We prove also that additional regularity in space of the data implies, in some cases, corresponding additional regularity in space of the solution. These results are instrumental to the design and the analysis of discretizations enjoying accurate stability and error estimates.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for N-phase Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with non-matching densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, numerous N-phase incompressible diffuse-interface flow models with non-matching densities have been proposed. Despite aiming to describe the same physics, these models are generally distinct, and an overarching modeling framework is absent. This paper provides a unified framework for N-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with a single momentum equation. The framework naturally emerges from continuum mixture theory, exhibits an energy-dissipative structure, and is invariant to the choice of fundamental variables. This opens the door to exploring connections between existing N-phase models and facilitates the computation of N-phase flow models rooted in continuum mixture theory.</description>

      <title>Semi-Continuity of the Morse Index for Ricci Shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove lower and upper semi-continuity of the Morse index for sequences of gradient Ricci shrinkers which bubble tree converge in the sense of past work by the author and Buzano. Our proofs rely on adapting recent arguments of Workman which were used to study certain sequences of CMC hypersurfaces and were in turn adapted from work on Da Lio-Gianocca-Riviere. Moreover, we are able to refine Workman's methods by using techniques related to polynomially weighted Sobolev spaces. This all also requires us to extend the analysis to handle when the shrinkers we study are non-compact, which we can do due to the availability of a suitable notion of finite weighted volume. Finally, we identify a technical condition which ensures the Morse index of an asymptotically conical shrinker is bounded below by the f-index of its asymptotic cone.</description>

      <title>Monge-Kantorovich Fitting With Sobolev Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $m &lt; n$, we consider the problem of ``best'' approximating an $n\text{-d}$ probability measure $\rho$ via an $m\text{-d}$ measure $\nu$ such that $\mathrm{supp}\ \nu$ has bounded total ``complexity.'' When $\rho$ is concentrated near an $m\text{-d}$ set we may interpret this as a manifold learning problem with noisy data. However, we do not restrict our analysis to this case, as the more general formulation has broader applications.
  We quantify $\nu$'s performance in approximating $\rho$ via the Monge-Kantorovich (also called Wasserstein) $p$-cost $\mathbb{W}_p^p(\rho, \nu)$, and constrain the complexity by requiring $\mathrm{supp}\ \nu$ to be coverable by an $f : \mathbb{R}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$ whose $W^{k,q}$ Sobolev norm is bounded by $\ell \geq 0$. This allows us to reformulate the problem as minimizing a functional $\mathscr J_p(f)$ under the Sobolev ``budget'' $\ell$. This problem is closely related to (but distinct from) principal curves with length constraints when $m=1, k = 1$ and an unsupervised analogue of smoothing splines when $k &gt; 1$. New challenges arise from the higher-order differentiability condition.
  We study the ``gradient'' of $\mathscr J_p$, which is given by a certain vector field that we call the barycenter field, and use it to prove a nontrivial (almost) strict monotonicity result. We also provide a natural discretization scheme and establish its consistency. We use this scheme as a toy model for a generative learning task, and by analogy, propose novel interpretations for the role regularization plays in improving training.</description>

      <title>Global Geometry within an SPDE Well-Posedness Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian manifold, we construct a family of intrinsic Gaussian noises indexed by a regularity parameter $\alpha\geq0$ to study the well-posedness of the parabolic Anderson model. We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on $\alpha$ similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using Feynman-Kac formula for moments, we also obtain exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.</description>
