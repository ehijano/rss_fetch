      <title>Detecting Machine-Generated Music with Explainability -- A Challenge and Early Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-generated music (MGM) has become a groundbreaking innovation with wide-ranging applications, such as music therapy, personalised editing, and creative inspiration within the music industry. However, the unregulated proliferation of MGM presents considerable challenges to the entertainment, education, and arts sectors by potentially undermining the value of high-quality human compositions. Consequently, MGM detection (MGMD) is crucial for preserving the integrity of these fields. Despite its significance, MGMD domain lacks comprehensive benchmark results necessary to drive meaningful progress. To address this gap, we conduct experiments on existing large-scale datasets using a range of foundational models for audio processing, establishing benchmark results tailored to the MGMD task. Our selection includes traditional machine learning models, deep neural networks, Transformer-based architectures, and State Space Models (SSM). Recognising the inherently multimodal nature of music, which integrates both melody and lyrics, we also explore fundamental multimodal models in our experiments. Beyond providing basic binary classification outcomes, we delve deeper into model behaviour using multiple explainable Aritificial Intelligence (XAI) tools, offering insights into their decision-making processes. Our analysis reveals that ResNet18 performs the best according to in-domain and out-of-domain tests. By providing a comprehensive comparison of benchmark results and their interpretability, we propose several directions to inspire future research to develop more robust and effective detection methods for MGM.</description>

      <title>SAVGBench: Benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the lack of multimodal generative models capable of producing high-quality videos with spatially aligned audio. While recent advancements in generative models have been successful in video generation, they often overlook the spatial alignment between audio and visuals, which is essential for immersive experiences. To tackle this problem, we establish a new research direction in benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation (SAVG). We propose three key components for the benchmark: dataset, baseline, and metrics. We introduce a spatially aligned audio-visual dataset, derived from an audio-visual dataset consisting of multichannel audio, video, and spatiotemporal annotations of sound events. We propose a baseline audio-visual diffusion model focused on stereo audio-visual joint learning to accommodate spatial sound. Finally, we present metrics to evaluate video and spatial audio quality, including a new spatial audio-visual alignment metric. Our experimental result demonstrates that gaps exist between the baseline model and ground truth in terms of video and audio quality, and spatial alignment between both modalities.</description>

      <title>Tuning Music Education: AI-Powered Personalization in Learning Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent AI-driven step-function advances in several longstanding problems in music technology are opening up new avenues to create the next generation of music education tools. Creating personalized, engaging, and effective learning experiences are continuously evolving challenges in music education. Here we present two case studies using such advances in music technology to address these challenges. In our first case study we showcase an application that uses Automatic Chord Recognition to generate personalized exercises from audio tracks, connecting traditional ear training with real-world musical contexts. In the second case study we prototype adaptive piano method books that use Automatic Music Transcription to generate exercises at different skill levels while retaining a close connection to musical interests. These applications demonstrate how recent AI developments can democratize access to high-quality music education and promote rich interaction with music in the age of generative AI. We hope this work inspires other efforts in the community, aimed at removing barriers to access to high-quality music education and fostering human participation in musical expression.</description>

      <title>Deep Speech Synthesis from Multimodal Articulatory Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amount of articulatory data available for training deep learning models is much less compared to acoustic speech data. In order to improve articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis performance in these low-resource settings, we propose a multimodal pre-training framework. On single-speaker speech synthesis tasks from real-time magnetic resonance imaging and surface electromyography inputs, the intelligibility of synthesized outputs improves noticeably. For example, compared to prior work, utilizing our proposed transfer learning methods improves the MRI-to-speech performance by 36% word error rate. In addition to these intelligibility results, our multimodal pre-trained models consistently outperform unimodal baselines on three objective and subjective synthesis quality metrics.</description>

      <title>NeckCare: Preventing Tech Neck using Hearable-based Multimodal Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tech neck is a modern epidemic caused by prolonged device usage and it can lead to significant neck strain and discomfort. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and preventing tech neck syndrome using non-invasive ubiquitous sensing techniques. We present NeckCare, a novel system leveraging hearable sensors, including IMUs and microphones, to monitor tech neck postures and estimate distance form screen in real-time. By analyzing pitch, displacement, and acoustic ranging data from 15 participants, we achieve posture classification accuracy of 96% using IMU data alone and 99% when combined with audio data. Our distance estimation technique is millimeter-level accurate even in noisy conditions. NeckCare provides immediate feedback to users, promoting healthier posture and reducing neck strain. Future work will explore personalizing alerts, predicting muscle strain, integrating neck exercise detection and enhancing digital eye strain prediction.</description>

      <title>SongEditor: Adapting Zero-Shot Song Generation Language Model as a Multi-Task Editor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of novel generative modeling paradigms, particularly audio language models, has significantly advanced the field of song generation. Although state-of-the-art models are capable of synthesizing both vocals and accompaniment tracks up to several minutes long concurrently, research about partial adjustments or editing of existing songs is still underexplored, which allows for more flexible and effective production. In this paper, we present SongEditor, the first song editing paradigm that introduces the editing capabilities into language-modeling song generation approaches, facilitating both segment-wise and track-wise modifications. SongEditor offers the flexibility to adjust lyrics, vocals, and accompaniments, as well as synthesizing songs from scratch. The core components of SongEditor include a music tokenizer, an autoregressive language model, and a diffusion generator, enabling generating an entire section, masked lyrics, or even separated vocals and background music. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SongEditor achieves exceptional performance in end-to-end song editing, as evidenced by both objective and subjective metrics. Audio samples are available in \url{https://cypress-yang.github.io/SongEditor_demo/}.</description>

      <title>Speech Watermarking with Discrete Intermediate Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech watermarking techniques can proactively mitigate the potential harmful consequences of instant voice cloning techniques. These techniques involve the insertion of signals into speech that are imperceptible to humans but can be detected by algorithms. Previous approaches typically embed watermark messages into continuous space. However, intuitively, embedding watermark information into robust discrete latent space can significantly improve the robustness of watermarking systems. In this paper, we propose DiscreteWM, a novel speech watermarking framework that injects watermarks into the discrete intermediate representations of speech. Specifically, we map speech into discrete latent space with a vector-quantized autoencoder and inject watermarks by changing the modular arithmetic relation of discrete IDs. To ensure the imperceptibility of watermarks, we also propose a manipulator model to select the candidate tokens for watermark embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness and imperceptibility, simultaneously. Moreover, our flexible frame-wise approach can serve as an efficient solution for both voice cloning detection and information hiding. Additionally, DiscreteWM can encode 1 to 150 bits of watermark information within a 1-second speech clip, indicating its encoding capacity. Audio samples are available at https://DiscreteWM.github.io/discrete_wm.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effects of Diffusion-based Conditional Generative Speech Models Used for Speech Enhancement on Dysarthric Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to explore the effect of pre-trained conditional generative speech models for the first time on dysarthric speech due to Parkinson's disease recorded in an ideal/non-noisy condition. Considering one category of generative models, i.e., diffusion-based speech enhancement, these models are previously trained to learn the distribution of clean (i.e, recorded in a noise-free environment) typical speech signals. Therefore, we hypothesized that when being exposed to dysarthric speech they might remove the unseen atypical paralinguistic cues during the enhancement process. By considering the automatic dysarthric speech detection task, in this study, we experimentally show that during the enhancement process of dysarthric speech data recorded in an ideal non-noisy environment, some of the acoustic dysarthric speech cues are lost. Therefore such pre-trained models are not yet suitable in the context of dysarthric speech enhancement since they manipulate the pathological speech cues when they process clean dysarthric speech. Furthermore, we show that the removed acoustics cues by the enhancement models in the form of residue speech signal can provide complementary dysarthric cues when fused with the original input speech signal in the feature space.</description>

      <title>Certification of Speaker Recognition Models to Additive Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker recognition technology is applied to various tasks, from personal virtual assistants to secure access systems. However, the robustness of these systems against adversarial attacks, particularly to additive perturbations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we pioneer applying robustness certification techniques to speaker recognition, initially developed for the image domain. Our work covers this gap by transferring and improving randomized smoothing certification techniques against norm-bounded additive perturbations for classification and few-shot learning tasks to speaker recognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on VoxCeleb 1 and 2 datasets for several models. We expect this work to improve the robustness of voice biometrics and accelerate the research of certification methods in the audio domain.</description>

      <title>NEST: Self-supervised Fast Conformer as All-purpose Seasoning to Speech Processing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13106v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has been proved to benefit a wide range of speech processing tasks, such as speech recognition/translation, speaker verification and diarization, etc. However, most of current approaches are computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a simplified and more efficient self-supervised learning framework termed as NeMo Encoder for Speech Tasks (NEST). Specifically, we adopt the FastConformer architecture with 8x sub-sampling rate, which is faster than Transformer or Conformer architectures. Instead of clustering-based quantization, we use fixed random projection for its simplicity and effectiveness. We also implement a generalized noisy speech augmentation that teaches the model to disentangle the main speaker from noise or other speakers. Experiments show that \model improves over existing self-supervised models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on a variety of speech processing tasks, such as speech recognition/translation, speaker diarization, spoken language understanding, etc. Code and checkpoints are publicly available via NVIDIA NeMo framework.</description>

      <title>CosyVoice 2: Scalable Streaming Speech Synthesis with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced CosyVoice, a multilingual speech synthesis model based on supervised discrete speech tokens. By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode. We invite readers to listen to the demos at https://funaudiollm.github.io/cosyvoice2.</description>

      <title>AudioCIL: A Python Toolbox for Audio Class-Incremental Learning with Multiple Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning, with its robust aotomatic feature extraction capabilities, has demonstrated significant success in audio signal processing. Typically, these methods rely on static, pre-collected large-scale datasets for training, performing well on a fixed number of classes. However, the real world is characterized by constant change, with new audio classes emerging from streaming or temporary availability due to privacy. This dynamic nature of audio environments necessitates models that can incrementally learn new knowledge for new classes without discarding existing information. Introducing incremental learning to the field of audio signal processing, i.e., Audio Class-Incremental Learning (AuCIL), is a meaningful endeavor. We propose such a toolbox named AudioCIL to align audio signal processing algorithms with real-world scenarios and strengthen research in audio class-incremental learning. Code is available at https://github.com/colaudiolab/AudioCIL.</description>

      <title>TAME: Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of compact UAVs has introduced significant risks to public safety, while traditional drone detection systems are often bulky and costly. To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification. Our model sets a new standard of performance on the MMUAD benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and effectiveness. The code and trained models are publicly available on GitHub \url{https://github.com/AmazingDay1/TAME}.</description>

      <title>I Know Your Feelings Before You Do: Predicting Future Affective Reactions in Human-Computer Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs) often serve as passive listeners that respond only after receiving user speech. To achieve human-like dialogue, we propose a novel future prediction architecture that allows an SDS to anticipate future affective reactions based on its current behaviors before the user speaks. In this work, we investigate two scenarios: speech and laughter. In speech, we propose to predict the user's future emotion based on its temporal relationship with the system's current emotion and its causal relationship with the system's current Dialogue Act (DA). In laughter, we propose to predict the occurrence and type of the user's laughter using the system's laughter behaviors in the current turn. Preliminary analysis of human-robot dialogue demonstrated synchronicity in the emotions and laughter displayed by the human and robot, as well as DA-emotion causality in their dialogue. This verifies that our architecture can contribute to the development of an anticipatory SDS.</description>

Abstract: As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</description>
