      <title>The meaning of "Big Bang"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What does ``Big Bang'' actually mean? What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression ``Big Bang'' began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Not even ``Pythagoras' theorem'' was discovered by Pythagoras, as is now well-known. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of ``Big Bang''. Everybody thinks to know what ``the Big Bang'' is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lema\^itre's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label ``Big Bang'' is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</description>

      <title>The Eschatian Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The history of astronomical discovery shows that many of the most detectable phenomena, especially detection firsts, are not typical members of their broader class, but rather rare, extreme cases with disproportionately large observational signatures. Motivated by this, we propose the Eschatian Hypothesis: that the first confirmed detection of an extraterrestrial technological civilization is most likely to be an atypical example, one that is unusually "loud" (i.e., producing an anomalously strong technosignature), and plausibly in a transitory, unstable, or even terminal phase. Using a toy model, we derive conditions under which such loud civilizations dominate detections, finding for example that if a society is loud for only $10^{-6}$ of its lifetime, it must emit ${\gtrsim}1$% of its total observable energy budget during that phase to outrun quieter populations. The hypothesis naturally motivates agnostic anomaly searches in wide-field, multi-channel, continuous surveys as a practical strategy for a first detection of extraterrestrial technology.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Assessment of Wind-Powered Green Hydrogen Production for US Industrial Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of supplying industrial thermal loads with green hydrogen produced via water electrolysis using two pathways off-grid systems powered by co-located wind turbines and battery energy storage (BESS), and on-grid systems that procure electricity directly from the wind farm power node and operate electrolysers in response to real-time locational marginal prices (LMPs).The optimization results show that off-grid wind-to-hydrogen configurations in high-resource regions can achieve levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOH) on the order of \$7/kg, driven by high wind capacity factors and optimized BESS sizing that ensures operational continuity .Similarly in, on-grid, price-responsive operation achieves LCOH values of \$0.5/kg, reflecting sensitivity to electricity market volatility. Overall, the results suggest that Midwest wind-rich regions can support competitive green hydrogen production for industrial heat, with grid-connected electrolysers remaining attractive in locations with frequent low LMP periods. This dual-path analysis provides a transparent framework for industrial hydrogen deployment and highlights practical transition strategies for decarbonizing U.S. manufacturing.</description>
