      <title>Groups admitting Wirtinger presentations and Gromov hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted Wirtinger presentations are generalizations of the classical Wirtinger presentations of knot and link groups. In this paper, we prove that if a finitely generated group admitting a twisted Wirtinger presentation is Gromov hyperbolic, then its second rational homology group vanishes. Moreover, if the group is torsion-free, then its second integral homology group also vanishes.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups of solvable groups of finite abelian ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic hull of a virtually polycyclic group $\Gamma$ is an important tool to study its group of automorphisms $\Aut(\Gamma)$ using linear algebraic groups. For example, it was used by Baues and Gr\"unewald to prove that $\Out(\Gamma)$ is an arithmetic group, although $\Aut(\Gamma)$ is not for a general virtually polycyclic group. The original definition due to Mostow was generalized to the class of virtually solvable groups of finite abelian ranks by Arapura and Nori to study K\"ahler manifolds, although other applications were not considered.
  This paper gives a new explicit construction of the $\Q$-algebraic hull for virtually solvable groups $\Gamma$ of finite abelian ranks, taking into account the spectrum $S$ of the group $\Gamma$. As an application, we make a detailed study into the structure of $\Aut(\Gamma)$ and show that several natural subgroups are $S$-arithmetic under the condition that $\Fitt(\Gamma)$ is $S$-arithmetic. Additionally, we demonstrate that the natural generalization of the aforementioned result by Baues and Gr\"unewald fails even for most solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups. Among the other applications of our main result is also a theorem showing that if $\Gamma$ is strongly scale-invariant, it must be virtually nilpotent, giving a special case of a conjecture by Nekrashevych and Pete and an extension of the previous known result for virtually polycyclic groups.</description>

      <title>Character degrees in principal blocks for distinct primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group of order divisible by two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. We show that $G$ possesses a non-trivial irreducible character of degree not divisible by $p$ nor $q$ lying in both the principal $p$- and $q$-block whenever $G$ is one of the following: an alternating group $\mathfrak{A}_n$, $n\geq 4$, a symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, $n\geq 3$, or a finite simple classical group of type A, B, or C, defined in characteristic distinct from $p$ and $q$. This extends earlier results of Navarro-Rizo-Schaeffer Fry for $2\in\{p,q\}$, and in particular completes the proof of an instance of a conjecture of the same authors, e.g., in the case of symmetric and alternating groups.</description>

      <title>Stark-Coleman Invariants and Quantum Lower Bounds: An Integrated Framework for Real Quadratic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class groups of real quadratic fields represent fundamental structures in algebraic number theory with significant computational implications. While Stark's conjecture establishes theoretical connections between special units and class group structures, explicit constructions have remained elusive, and precise quantum complexity bounds for class group computations are lacking. Here we establish an integrated framework defining Stark-Coleman invariants $\kappa_p(K) = \log_p \left( \frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{St},p}}{\sigma(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{St},p})} \right) \mod p^{\mathrm{ord}_p(\Delta_K)}$ through a synthesis of $p$-adic Hodge theory and extended Coleman integration. We prove these invariants classify class groups under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), resolving the isomorphism problem for discriminants $D &gt; 10^{32}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach yields the quantum lower bound $\exp\left(\Omega\left(\frac{\log D}{(\log \log D)^2}\right)\right)$ for the class group discrete logarithm problem, improving upon previous bounds lacking explicit constants. Our results indicate that Stark units constrain the geometric organization of class groups, providing theoretical insight into computational complexity barriers.</description>

      <title>On groups of diffeomorphisms of the interval with finitely many fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:1503.03852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [13], it is proved that any subgroup of $\mathrm{Diff}_{+}^{\omega }(I)$ (the group of orientation preserving analytic diffeomorphisms of the interval) is either metaabelian or does not satisfy a law. A stronger question is asked whether or not the Girth Alternative holds for subgroups of $\mathrm{Diff}_{+}^{\omega }(I)$. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively for even a larger class of groups of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the interval where every non-identity element has finitely many fixed points. We show that every such (irreducible) group is either affine (in particular, metaabelian) or has infinite girth. The proof is based on our study of discrete subgroups of the diffeomorphism group $\mathrm{Diff}_{+}(I)$ which we initiated in [9] and later developed in [1] and [2]; more specifically, our results are obtained by sharpening the tools from the earlier works [1] and [2]. One of the major tools (local transitivity) is heavily exploited in [2] to get an extension of Holders theorem which is crucially used in this paper. We show that local transitivity can be proved for any (up to a conjugacy) non-affine group of irreducible diffeomorphisms with every non-identity element having finitely many fixed points.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of graphs associated to the Basilica group</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.10505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the foundation of the spectral analysis of the Laplacian on the orbital Schreier graphs of the Basilica group, the iterated monodromy group of the quadratic polynomial $z^2-1$. This group is an important example in the class of self-similar amenable but not elementary amenable finite automata groups studied by Grigorchuk, \.Zuk, \v Suni\'c, Bartholdi, Vir\'ag, Nekrashevych, Kaimanovich, Nagnibeda et al. We prove that the spectrum of the Laplacian has infinitely many gaps and that the support of the KNS Spectral Measure is a Cantor set. Moreover, on a generic blowup, the spectrum coincides with this Cantor set, and is pure point with localized eigenfunctions and eigenvalues located at the endpoints of the gaps.</description>

      <title>Sandpile group of infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite connected graph $G$ and a non-empty subset $S$ of its vertices thought of sinks, the so-called critical group (or sandpile group) $C(G, S)$ has been studied for a long time. We present a class of graphs where such an extension can be made in a unified way. Similar extension was made by Maes, C. and Redig, F. and Saada, E., but we propose a more algebraic point of view.
  Namely, consider a $C$-net $S\subset \mathbb Z^2$. We define a sandpile dynamics on $\mathbb Z^2$ with the set $S$ of sinks. For such a choice of sinks, a relaxation of any bounded state is well defined. This allows us to define a group $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ of recurrent states of this model. We show that $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ is isomorphic to a group of $S^1$-valued discrete harmonic functions on $\mathbb Z^2\setminus S$.
  Examples of $S$, for which $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ has no torsion or has all torsions, are provided. Pontryagin dual point of view is investigated. A discussion about perspectives of a sandpile group for $\mathbb Z^2$ as a projective limit concludes this work.</description>

      <title>An equivariant bijection of irreducible Brauer characters above the Dade-Glauberman-Nagao correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Glauberman correspondence and its generalisation, the Dade--Glauberman--Nagao (DGN) correspondence, play an important role in studying local-global counting conjectures and their reductions to (quasi-)simple groups. These reduction theorems require an additional set of compatibility conditions for the DGN correspondence. In this paper, we prove that there exists a bijection of irreducible Brauer characters above the DGN correspondence that is equivariant with Galois automorphisms and group automorphisms and preserves vertices. Our proof utilizes the framework of $\hH$-triples developed by Navarro--Sp\"ath--Vallejo. The results establish a reduction theorem for the Galois Alperin weight conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the class-breadth conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class-breadth conjecture of Leedham-Green, Neumann and Wiegold states that for each $p$-group, $cl(G)\leq b(G) + 1$, where $cl(G)$, $b(G)$ denote the nilpotency class and the breadth of $G$. While several counter-examples to this conjecture have been found for $p = 2$, it is still open in general for $p &gt; 2$. This article is dedicated to one simplified version of the conjecture for $p &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>The group of affine transformations of homogeneous spaces with discrete isotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.02575v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to compute the group of affine transformations of a homogeneous $G$-space under specific conditions: when the group $G$ and the homogeneous $G$-space admit linear connections so that the natural projection is affine, and with discrete isotropy group. If $G$ admits a bi-invariant linear connection, we establish conditions under which the homogeneous space admits an invariant linear connection. As a consequence, when the isotropy group is discrete, their respective groups of affine transformations are locally isomorphic. As an application of our work, we calculate the group of the affine transformations of orientable flat affine surfaces and 3-dimensional flat affine tori.</description>

      <title>Graph quandles: Generalized Cayley graphs of racks and right quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve two open problems of Valeriy Bardakov about Cayley graphs of racks and graph-theoretic realizations of right quasigroups. We also extend Didier Caucal's classification of labeled Cayley digraphs to right quasigroups and related algebraic structures like quandles.
  First, we characterize markings of graphs that realize racks. As an application, we construct rack-theoretic (di)graph invariants from permutation representations of graph automorphism groups. We describe how to compute these invariants with general results for path graphs and cycle graphs.
  Second, we show that all right quasigroups are realizable by edgeless graphs and complete (di)graphs. Using Schreier (di)graphs, we also characterize Cayley (di)graphs of right quasigroups Q that realize Q. In particular, all racks are realizable by their full Cayley (di)graphs.
  Finally, we give a graph-theoretic characterization of labeled Cayley digraphs of right-cancellative magmas, right-divisible magmas, right quasigroups, racks, quandles, involutory racks, and kei.</description>
