      <title>Scalable synchronization cluster in networked chaotic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster synchronization in synthetic networks of coupled chaotic oscillators is investigated. It is found that despite the asymmetric nature of the network structure, a subset of the oscillators can be synchronized as a cluster while the other oscillators remain desynchronized. Interestingly, with the increase of the coupling strength, the cluster is expanding gradually by recruiting the desynchronized oscillators one by one. This new synchronization phenomenon, which is named ``scalable synchronization cluster", is explored theoretically by the method of eigenvector-based analysis, and it is revealed that the scalability of the cluster is attributed to the unique feature of the eigenvectors of the network coupling matrix. The transient dynamics of the cluster in response to random perturbations are also studied, and it is shown that in restoring to the synchronization state, oscillators inside the cluster are stabilized in sequence, illustrating again the hierarchy of the oscillators. The findings shed new light on the collective behaviors of networked chaotic oscillators, and are helpful for the design of real-world networks where scalable synchronization clusters are concerned.</description>

      <title>Characterizing far from equilibrium states of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the mathematical toolbox of the inverse scattering transform to study quantitatively the number of solitons in far from equilibrium one-dimensional systems described by the defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. We present a simple method to identify the discrete eigenvalues in the Lax spectrum and provide a extensive benchmark of its efficiency. Our method can be applied in principle to all physical systems described by the defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation and allows to identify the solitons velocity distribution in numerical simulations and possibly experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynein-driven self-organization of microtubules: An entropy- and network-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microtubules self-organize to form part of the cellular cytoskeleton. They give cells their shape and play a crucial role in cell division and intracellular transport. Strikingly, microtubules driven by motor proteins reorganize into stable mitotic/meiotic spindles with high spatial and temporal precision during successive cell division cycles. Although the topic has been extensively studied, the question remains: What defines such microtubule networks' spatial order and robustness? Here, we aim to approach this problem by analyzing a simplified computational model of radial microtubule self-organization driven by a single type of motor protein -- dyneins. We establish that the spatial order of the steady-state pattern is likely associated with the dynein-driven microtubule motility. At the same time, the structure of the microtubule network is likely linked to its connectivity at the beginning of self-organization. Using the continuous variation of dynein concentration, we reveal hysteresis in microtubule self-organization, ensuring the stability of radial filament structures.</description>

      <title>Collisions of Light Bullets with Different Circular Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisions of left- and right-polarized spatiotemporal optical solitons have been numerically simulated for a locally isotropic focusing Kerr medium with anomalous chromatic dispersion. The stable propagation of such ``light bullets'' in a moderate nonlinear regime is ensured by a transverse parabolic profile of the refraction index in a multimode waveguide. The transverse motion of centers of mass of wave packets in such systems occurs on classical trajectories of a harmonic oscillator, whereas the motion in the longitudinal direction is uniform. Therefore, collisions of two solitons can be not only head-on but also tangential. An inelastic collision of two solitons with opposite circular polarizations can result either in two binary light bullets combining the left and right polarization or in more complex bound systems.
