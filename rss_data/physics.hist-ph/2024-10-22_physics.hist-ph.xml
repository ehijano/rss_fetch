      <title>What Emergence Can Possibly Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider emergence from the perspective of dynamics: states of a system evolving with time. We focus on the role of a decomposition of wholes into parts, and attempt to characterize relationships between levels without reference to whether higher-level properties are "novel" or "unexpected." We offer a classification of different varieties of emergence, with and without new ontological elements at higher levels.</description>

      <title>Fusion divided: what prevented European collaboration on controlled thermonuclear fusion in 1958</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva today operates the world`s largest particle accelerator complex and is a much-cited prototype for high-profile international collaboration. What is less well known, however, is that when its first big accelerator was still under construction, CERN went through an experimental phase in terms of scientific fields and exchanges with similar organizations. This was reflected in a controversy surrounding a CERN-sponsored study group on controlled thermonuclear fusion that met from 1958 to 1964. Invited scientists from CERN member states attended these meetings, as did delegates from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), the European Atomic Energy Agency (ENEA), and the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Although the CERN Study Group on Fusion Problems created an international network for the exchange of reports and for better coordination of scientific projects to avoid duplication of work, it failed to materialize joint fusion research programmes. This article explains why, thereby providing insights into intergovernmental power dynamics and how those shaped the relationships between international organizations.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the second edition of "The Supersymmetric World"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first Edition of this book was released in 2000, just before the symposium ``Thirty Years of Supersymmetry'' was held at the William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute (FTPI) of the University of Minnesota. Founders and trailblazers of supersymmetry descended on FTPI, as well as a large crowd of younger theorists deeply involved in research in this area. Since then 23 years have elapsed and significant changes happened in supersymmetry (SUSY). Its history definitely needs an update. Such an update is presented below. The Second Edition of the revised collection will be released in 2024.</description>
