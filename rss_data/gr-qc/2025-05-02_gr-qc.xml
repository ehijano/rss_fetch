      <title>Results from Hubble parameter data using a model independent method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a model-independent analysis method, we analyze $H(z)$ parameter data with some restrictive conditions. We find that: (a) the Universe may experience an accelerated expansion with a confidence level greater than 5 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{101}\in (0, 0.36)$ and greater than 1.9 $\sigma$ at redshifts $z_{3835}\in (1.3, 1.53)$ and $z_{3836}\in (1.43, 1.53)$; (b) the Universe may experience a decelerated expansion with a confidence level greater than 1.5 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{2012}\in (0.40, 0.52)$; (c) $w_{\rm{x}}\leq w_{\rm{t}}&lt;-1$ with confidence level great than 1.6 $\sigma$ at redshift $z_{3836}\in (1.43, 1.53)$.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Dispersion of Gravitational Waves using Multi-Band Observation including Deci-Hertz: A Unique Probe to Cosmic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion in the speed of gravitational waves is a novel way to test the general theory of relativity and understand whether the origin of cosmic acceleration is due to any alternative theory of gravity. Several alternative theories of gravity predict dispersion in the gravitational wave signal in a frequency-dependent deviation from the speed of light at lower frequencies than accessible from current ground-based detectors. We show how a multi-band observation of gravitational wave signal combining deci-Hertz gravitational wave signal from LGWA (Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna) with ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, and also including LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), we can probe the energy scale associated with effective theory of gravity with a precision of approximately $8.6\%$ by combining only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ high SNR multi-band gravitational wave events. This precision will further improve with the inclusion of more events as $\sqrt{N}$. In the future, this measurement will shed light on an unexplored domain of fundamental physics and will bring deeper insights into the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration. The operation of the gravitational wave detector in the deci-Hertz frequency band is key to exploring this frontier of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>superB/NRPy: Scalable, Task-Based Numerical Relativity for 3G Gravitational Wave Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern gravitational-wave science demands increasingly accurate and computationally intensive numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The Python-based, open-source NRPy framework generates optimized C/C++ code for NR, including the complete NR code BlackHoles@Home (BH@H), which leverages curvilinear coordinates well-suited to many astrophysical scenarios. Historically, BH@H was limited to single-node OpenMP CPU parallelism. To address this, we introduce superB, an open-source extension to NRPy that enables automatic generation of scalable, task-based, distributed-memory Charm++ code from existing BH@H modules. The generated code partitions the structured grids used by NRPy/BH@H, managing communication between them. Its correctness is validated through bit-identical results with the standard OpenMP version on a single node and via a head-on binary black hole simulation in cylindrical-like coordinates, accurately reproducing quasi-normal modes (up to $\ell=8$). The superB/NRPy-generated code demonstrates excellent strong scaling, achieving an $\approx 45$x speedup on 64 nodes (7168 cores) compared to the original single-node OpenMP code for a large 3D vacuum test. This scalable infrastructure benefits demanding simulations and lays the groundwork for future multi-patch grid support, targeting long inspirals, extreme parameter studies, and rapid follow-ups. This infrastructure readily integrates with other NRPy/BH@H-based projects, enabling performant scaling for the general relativistic hydrodynamics code GRoovy, and facilitating future coupling with GPU acceleration via the NRPy-CUDA project.</description>

      <title>Origins of Thermalization in Semiclassical Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of accelerated frames in cosmology, and obtain origins of thermalization of the cosmic evolution of the semi-classical universe. We implement a transformation in super-space, and the WKB wave function defined on super space has a Bogoliubov transformation. In the transformed frame we find the density matrix which is mixed, and this is the sign of a thermal system. Whereas this result does not have the same interpretations of a particle thermalization in accelerated frames, one can show the super space transformation similar to a double Rindler transformation of real space-time coordinates. We also discuss the implications of the super-space transformation in loop quantum cosmology.</description>

      <title>Emergent Lorentzian dispersion relations from a Euclidean scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can one be fooled into thinking that space and time are fundamentally described by a Lorentzian manifold? In this article, we describe a scenario in which a theory constructed on a (Euclidean signature) Riemannian manifold can lead to degrees of freedom with Lorentzian dispersion relations. In particular, we perform a perturbative analysis of a renormalizable shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theory and find that it can, in principle, admit a massless tensor degree of freedom with a Lorentzian dispersion relation, while the remaining degrees of freedom will, in general, satisfy Euclidean dispersion relations, we argue that they can be brought under control by elliptic equations with an appropriate choice of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating $\mathcal{C}$-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic self-gravitating fluids are computed using the extended Hartle structure equations, including anisotropic effects, derived in our previous paper. We focus on the so-called $\mathcal{C}$-star, whose anisotropic pressure follows a fully covariant equation of state (EoS), while a standard polytrope describes the radial pressure. We determine surface and integral properties, such as the moment of inertia, mass change, mass quadrupole moment, and ellipticity. Notably, for certain values of the compactness parameter, highly anisotropic $\mathcal{C}$-stars exhibit a prolate shape rather than the typical oblate form, an intriguing behavior also observed in other anisotropic systems like Bowers-Liang spheres and stars governed by a quasi-local EoS. Although the $\mathcal{C}$-stars considered in this study are limited by stability criteria and cannot sustain compactness beyond $M/R\approx0.38$, we found indications that certain rotational perturbations exhibit similarities to those observed in other ultracompact systems approaching the black hole limit.</description>

      <title>Shadow and geometric scattering analysis of a new black hole with magnetic charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a newly charged black hole with magnetic charge $q$ and coupling constant $\mu$ from the Einstein-nonlinear electrodynamics theory inspired by quasi-topological terms. We perform the shadow and geometric scattering analysis of this black hole. For $\mu=0.01$, we have four solution branches labelled by $2\pm$, 3, and 4 of the horizon, while there exists a single branch labelled by 2 for $\mu=0.1$. There is the naked singularity (NS) arisen from the magnetic charge extension of the photon spheres for the 3 and 4-branches. In case of $q&lt;1$, shadow radii of the $2$-branch with $\mu$=0.01 and 0.1 are the same as that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, while the 3-NS branch of $q&gt;1$ is constrained by the EHT observation. The geometric scattering analysis is performed to understand the peculiar forms of the critical impact factors.</description>

      <title>A polytopal discrete de Rham scheme for the exterior calculus Einstein's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, based on the $3+1$ decomposition in [23, 32], we present a fully exterior calculus breakdown of spacetime and Einstein's equations. Links to the orthonormal frame approach [37] are drawn to help understand the variables in this context. Two formulations are derived, discretised and tested using the exterior calculus discrete de Rham complex [12], and some discrete quantities are shown to be conserved in one of the cases.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiations from periodic orbits around Einstein-\AE{}ther black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the gravitational wave emission from the periodic orbital motion of a test particle around two specific types of black holes in Einstein-\AE{}ther theory, a modified gravity that locally breaks Lorentz symmetry while remaining consistent with theoretical and observational constraints through a careful selection of its four coupling constants $c_i$. Focusing on the impact of the \ae{}ther field, we examine the properties of periodic orbits, which are characterized by a set of three topological integers $(z, w, v)$ that uniquely classify their trajectories. We then calculate the gravitational waveforms generated by these periodic orbits, identifying potential observational signatures. Our analysis reveals a direct connection between the zoom-whirl orbital behavior of the small compact object and the gravitational waveforms it emits: higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly intricate waveform substructures. Moreover, the presence of the \ae{}ther field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be potentially tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from a type II perturbation in the absence and presence of pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate primordial black holes (PBHs) formed from extremely large amplitudes of primordial curvature fluctuations, classified as type II. Type II fluctuations differ from type I by the presence of a stationary point on the initial time slice, when we see the areal radius as a function of the radial coordinate. Starting from these type II perturbations to form black holes, the nonlinear evolution governed by the Einstein equations generally results in two distinct types, A and B, of horizon configurations, respectively characterized by the absence and presence of a bifurcating trapping horizon where past and future trapping horizons meet. In this paper, we use the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi solution to show that type I/II and type A/B classifications are equivalent for a spherically symmetric dust fluid system, regardless of the fluctuation profile. However, this equivalence does not generally hold in the presence of pressure.</description>

      <title>On the structure of big bang singularities in spatially homogenous solutions to the Einstein non-linear scalar field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject of this article is the structure of big bang singularities in spatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein non-linear scalar field equations. In particular, we focus on Bianchi class A; i.e., developments arising from left invariant initial data on unimodular $3$-dimensional Lie groups. We prove that solutions are either vacuum or matter dominated, depending on whether the limit of an expansion normalised normal derivative of the scalar field is zero or not, respectively. The main result concerning the asymptotics in the direction of the singularity is, essentially, that solutions induce data on the singularity, with two exceptions: vacuum dominated Bianchi type VIII and IX without additional symmetries (they are neither isotropic nor locally rotationally symmetric) exhibit BKL-type oscillations. Disregarding the exceptions, there is in fact a bijection between initial data on the singularity and developments. Initial data on the singularity thus play a central role in the analysis; they both parameterise developments and give optimal asymptotic information. However, the main point of the article is to prove that the set of isometry classes of initial data on the singularity (of a fixed Bianchi type and symmetry (such as isotropy, local rotational symmetry etc.)) has a smooth structure; that the set of isometry classes of developments (similarly restricted) has a smooth structure which fits together with the natural smooth structure of isometry classes of regular initial data with fixed mean curvature; and that the Einstein flow generates a diffeomorphism between the two sets. However, the article contains substantial additional information, such as, e.g., the construction of a large class of spatially locally homogeneous solutions that can be demonstrated to be globally non-linearly stable (in the absence of symmetries) both to the future and to the past.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrected Geodesic Motion in Polymer Kerr-like Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating black holes are prevalent in astrophysical observations, and a Kerr-like solution that incorporates quantum gravity effects is essential for constructing realistic models. In this work, we analyze the geodesic motion of massive particles in a Kerr-like polymer spacetime, incorporating quantum corrections via a parameter $A_\lambda$. We demonstrate that increasing $A_\lambda$ allows for additional orbital evolution in extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems before merging. Our results show that the radii, energy, and angular momentum of both the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and marginal circular orbit (MCO) decrease as $A_\lambda$ increases. Furthermore, when the primary object becomes a wormhole, both prograde ISCO and MCO can intersect the transition surface at the wormhole throat and vanish as $A_\lambda$ grows. Additionally, we find that the eccentricity of periodic geodesic motion decreases monotonically with increasing $A_\lambda$. Finally, we explore the variation of the rational number that characterizes periodic motion and highlight the influence of the quantum parameter on different types of periodic orbits, classified by a set of integers associated with the rational number. This work contributes to the understanding of quantum gravity effects and offers potential observational signatures, particularly in the study of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Can We Probe Spacetime Non-commutativity Through Tidal Deformability of Compact Objects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of spacetime non-commutativity on the tidal deformability of compact objects and explore the feasibility of detecting non-commutative (NC) effects through gravitational wave (GW) observations. We considered NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge theory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. While several types of compact objects have been proposed as candidates for probing spacetime non-commutativity, particularly at the horizon scales, our study showed analytically that, for compact objects with non-singular metric at their surface (such as neutron stars and boson stars), the NC correction to their tidal deformability converge to a finite value at the black-hole-compactness limit, eliminating infinite enhancement at the horizon scales. We then compute the NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several different models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. By comparing the results, we assess the scale of NC effects across different compactness regimes and discuss the conditions under which these NC effects can be amplified. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction dominates the tidal deformability of a compact object near the black-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars and boson stars are not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-commutativity, while relying on the tidal deformability through GW observations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formulation of Einstein's gravitational field equations in four space-time dimensions is presented using generalized differential forms and Cartan's equations for metric geometries. Cartan's structure equations are extended by using generalized metric connections. They are then employed to represent Einstein's field equations and their solutions. When the energy-momentum tensor is zero the generalized connections can be chosen to be flat and different solutions of Einstein's equations can be related by generalizations of the Poincar\'e group. An action for the vacuum field equations is constructed by generalizing the Nieh-Yan three-form.</description>

      <title>Joint inference for gravitational wave signals and glitches using a data-informed glitch model</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian noise transients, glitches, which can bias the inference of astrophysical signal parameters. Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a pre-processing step, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis (e.g. BayesWave). In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to build a parameterised model of glitches. We train a normalising flow on known glitches from the Gravity Spy catalogue, constructing an informative prior on the glitch model. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference analysis with Bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously. We demonstrate the performance of our method through bias reduction, glitch identification and Bayesian model selection on real glitches. Our results show that this approach effectively removes glitches from the data, significantly improving source parameter estimation and reducing bias.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the BMS evolution equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects in asymptotically flat Einstein gravity follow from local Carroll, Weyl, and diffeomorphism invariance at the null conformal boundary, upon providing a minimalistic holographic dictionary as the sole input from the bulk. This result is a significant step in the quest for a flat-space holographic correspondence and offers a geometric implementation of the radiative degrees of freedom that source the boundary theory in the presence of bulk gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Stable non-linear evolution in regularised higher derivative effective field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties of a recently proposed regularisation scheme to formulate the initial value problem for general (relativistic) effective field theories (EFTs) with arbitrary higher order equations of motion. We consider a simple UV theory that describes a massive and a massless scalar degree of freedom. Integrating out the heavy field gives rise to an EFT for the massless scalar. By adding suitable regularising terms to the EFT truncated at the level of dimension-$4$ and dimension-$6$ operators, we show that the resulting regularised theories admit a well-posed initial value problem. The regularised theories are related by a field redefinition to the original truncated EFTs and they propagate massive ghost fields (whose masses can be chosen to be of the order of the UV mass scale), in addition to the light field. We numerically solve the equations of motion of the UV theory and those of the regularised EFTs in $1+1$-dimensional Minkowski space for various choices of initial data and UV mass parameter. When derivatives of the initial data are sufficiently small compared to the UV mass scale, the regularised EFTs exhibit stable evolution in the computational domain and provide very accurate approximations of the UV theory. On the other hand, when the initial gradients of the light field are comparable to the UV mass scale, the effective field theory description breaks down and the corresponding regularised EFTs exhibit ghost-like/tachyonic instabilities. Finally, we also formulate a conjecture on the global nonlinear stability of the vacuum in the regularised scalar EFTs in $3+1$ dimensions. These results suggest that the regularisation approach provides a consistent classical description of the UV theory in a regime where effective field theory is applicable.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Accretion onto Neutron Stars: from Photon-trapped to Neutrino-cooled Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in a tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a massive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas forms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and temperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be converted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a non-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended accretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star. The impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by approximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an adiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low accretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak magnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic field mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the atmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the accretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these results with more general initial conditions and describing the main features of the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of hypercritically accreting NSs.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the scalaron dark matter in $f (R)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $f(R)$ gravity, the scalaron$\unicode{x2014}$a scalar degree of freedom arising from modification of General Relativity$\unicode{x2014}$could account for all dark matter if its mass lies in the meV$\unicode{x2013}$MeV range. In this work, we revisit the scalaron's interactions with Standard Model particles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. In particular, we refine the scalaron decay rate into photons. Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of dark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation produced by these decays. We also estimate the contribution of primordial thermal scalarons to the present dark matter density and find it to be negligible. This supports the original scenario in which the scalaron dark matter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.</description>

      <title>Simple Holography in General Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simple or "outermost" wedge in AdS is the portion of the entanglement wedge that can be reconstructed with sub-exponential effort from CFT data. Here we furnish a definition in arbitrary spacetimes: given an input wedge $a$ analogous to a CFT boundary region, the simple wedge $z(a)$ is the largest wedge accessible by a "zigzag," a certain sequence of antinormal light-sheets. We show that $z(a)$ is a throat, and that it is contained in every other throat. This implies that $z(a)$ is unique; that it is contained in the generalized entanglement wedge; and that it reduces to the AdS prescription as a special case.
  The zigzag explicitly constructs a preferred Cauchy slice that renders the simple wedge accessible from $a$; thus it adds a novel structure even in AdS. So far, no spacelike construction is known to reproduce these results, even in time-symmetric settings. This may have implications for the modeling of holographic encoding by tensor networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.06671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogue models of black holes typically have collective excitations with a dispersion relation that breaks the effective Lorentz symmetry at high energy. We investigate the consequences of such Lorentz violations on the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the system, that is, the modes of energy dissipation. The model involves low frequency capillary-gravity waves (whose dispersion relation can be adjusted between sub- and superluminal modifications) around a draining vortex, which mimics a rotating black hole spacetime. For a subluminal/superluminal modification, the frequency and decay rate of co-rotating modes can be reduced/increased substantially, whilst counter-rotating modes are barely affected. A further consequence of the superluminal modification is that there are no corotating QNMs above a critical rotation and no counter-rotating ones below a critical rotation for strong enough Lorentz violations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06329v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the formation of type II primordial black holes (PBHs) resulting from extremely large amplitudes of initial fluctuations in a radiation-dominated universe. We find that, for a sufficiently large initial amplitude, the configuration of trapping horizons shows characteristic structure due to the existence of bifurcating trapping horizons. We call this type of configuration of the trapping horizons type II-B PBH, while the structure without a bifurcating trapping horizon type II-A PBH. In Ref. [1], in the dust-dominated universe, the type B PBH can be realized by the type II initial fluctuation, which is characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius as a function of the radial coordinate (throat structure) in contrast with the standard case, type A PBH with a monotonic areal radius (type I fluctuation). Our research reveals that a type II fluctuation does not necessarily result in a type B PBH in the radiation-dominated case. We also find that for an initial amplitude well above the threshold value, the resulting PBH mass may either increase or decrease with the initial amplitude, depending on its specific profile rather than its fluctuation type.</description>

      <title>$f(R)$ gravity in the solar system and cosmological scalarons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since last two decades $f(R)$ gravity theory has been extensively used as a serious alternative of general relativity to mimic the effects of dark energy. The theory presents a Yukawa correction to Newtonian gravitational potential, acting as a fifth force of Nature. Generally speaking, this new force is mediated by a scalar field known as scalaron. It affects orbital dynamics of test bodies around a central mass. When the scalaron becomes massive $f(R)$ gravity reduces to Newtonian theory in the weak field limit. In this paper we investigate scalaron mass in the solar system through existing measurements of perihelion shift of planets, Cassini's measurement of the Parametrized Post Newtonian parameter and measurement of the Brans-Dicke coupling constant. The scalaron mass is constrained in the range ($9.29\times 10^{-18}-5.64\times 10^{-16}$) eV. Our results are consistent with existing constraints on the theory arising from the environment of the Galactic Center black hole and binary pulsar systems. Scalarons realized in the solar system are reproduced in the radiation era (($0.88-53.89$) sec) of the universe with a time varying scalaron mass.</description>

      <title>Linear Response Analysis of the Semiclassical Approximation to Spin 1/2 Quantum Electrodynamics in 1+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An investigation of the validity of the semiclassical approximation to quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions is given. The criterion for validity used here involves the impact of quantum fluctuations introduced through a two-point function which emerges naturally when considering the stability of the backreaction equation to linear order perturbations, resulting in the linear response equation. Consideration is given to the case of a spatially homogeneous electric field generated by a classical source, coupled to a quantized massive spin 1/2 field. Solutions to the linear response equation as well as the impact of quantum fluctuations introduced through the current density two-point correlation function are presented for two relevant electric field-to-mass parameter values $qE/m^2$, indicative of the strength of the backreaction process. Previous efforts utilized approximate solutions to the linear response equation that were expected to be valid for early times. A comparative analysis is given between the exact and approximate solutions in order to validate this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a relativistic framework of integral quantization applied to the motion of spinless particles in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The proposed scheme is based on coherent states generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group and has been motivated by the Hamiltonian description of the geodesic motion in General Relativity. We believe that this formulation should also allow for a generalization to the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes. A key element in our construction is the use of suitably defined positive operator-valued measures. We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization. A direct application of our model, including a computation of transition amplitudes between states characterized by fixed positions and momenta, is postponed to a forthcoming article.</description>

      <title>One-stop strategy to search for long-duration gravitational-wave signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind continuous gravitational-wave (CWs) searches are a significant computational challenge due to their long duration and weak amplitude of the involved signals. To cope with such problem, the community has developed a variety of data-analysis strategies which are usually tailored to specific CW searches; this prevents their applicability across the nowadays broad landscape of potential CW source. Also, their sensitivity is typically hard to model, and thus usually requires a significant computing investment. We present fasttracks, a massively-parallel engine to evaluate detection statistics for generic CW signals using GPU computing. We demonstrate a significant increase in computational efficiency by parallelizing the brute-force evaluation of detection statistics without using any computational approximations. Also, we introduce a simple and scalable postprocessing which allows us to formulate a generic semianalytic sensitivity estimate algorithm. These proposals are tested in a minimal all-sky search in data from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The strategies discussed here will become increasingly relevant in the coming years as long-duration signals become a standard observation of future ground-based and space-borne detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. We also lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We indicate a few possible cases of improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward any detectable eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong-field gravity simulators are laboratory experiments that can investigate a wide range of both classical and quantum phenomena occurring in nature. In this work, we introduce an effective geometry that captures most of the characteristics of the strong-field regime of astrophysical, rotating black holes. This geometry can represent a vortex made from a variety of fluid and superfluid profiles with zero viscosity, making it a promising finite-temperature quantum-field-theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes. Our geometry includes not only the typical radial flow which gives rise to an acoustic horizon, but also azimuthal circulation of the fluid. We compute the quasinormal modes, semi-analytically, and the exact quasibound states of acoustic excitations interacting with this effective geometry. The resulting spectra can be identified for both co-rotating and counter-rotating surface acoustic waves. In particular, the behavior of our acoustic geometry with circulation aligns with the phenomenology observed in recent experiments that include superfluids.</description>

Abstract: We perform the thermodynamic analysis of a charged Horndeski black hole (CHB) with mass $m$ and charge $q$ obtained from the Einstein-Horndeski-Maxwell theory. There are two solution branches: one is for the CHB and the other is for the naked singularity (NS). Thermodynamic behavior for the CHB is similar to that for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole but its Helmholtz free energy is always positive. If the NS point is included as an extremal point, then the Helmholtz free energy is always negative, implying that the globally stable region is achieved anywhere. For the NS, its temperature has a maximum point, its heat capacity remains negative without having Davies point, and its free energy decreases without limitation as the charge $q$ increases.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) on the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of a magnetic charged black hole by analyzing the motion of test particles and their epicyclic frequencies. Starting from the effective potential, angular momentum, and energy of circular orbits, we examine how the NED parameter b alters the orbital dynamics. We find that as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards the Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies. We further investigate the variation in the radii of QPOs with respect to the NED parameter b by employing the RP, WD, and ER models. We also perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using observational QPO data from a diverse set of black hole sources spanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive regimes. The MCMC results yield consistent constraints on the parameter b across all mass regimes, indicating that NED effects leave a distinguishable signature on the QPO structure of a charged black hole.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitational waves from primordial gravitational collapses</title>

Abstract: A large primordial density perturbation of the Hubble scale will gravitationally collapse, generating an outgoing sound shell whether or not a primordial black hole (PBH) is formed. In this Letter, we report a new source of the stochastic gravitational wave background induced by the collision of sound shells in the early Universe. The peak frequency and amplitude in the GW spectrum depend on the Hubble horizon and the abundance of sound shells. Abundant density perturbations would lead to GW backgrounds potentially detectable for future pulsar timing arrays and ground-based/space-borne detectors. For those perturbations that collapse into PBHs, future null detection of the corresponding high-frequency GW background could put new observational constraints on those PBHs that have already evaporated.</description>

      <title>Non-Minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills Black Holes: Fundamental Quasinormal Mode and Grey-Body factors versus Outburst of Overtones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, an exact black hole solution in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory was obtained, and its quasinormal modes were subsequently analyzed using the JWKB approximation \cite{Gogoi:2024vcx}. However, we demonstrate that this analysis lacks sufficient accuracy when studying modes with $\ell \leq n$, where $\ell$ is the multipole number and $n$ is the overtone number. To address this, we compute the quasinormal frequencies using the precise Leaver method. Our results show that while the fundamental mode deviates only slightly from the Schwarzschild value, the first few overtones exhibit significantly larger deviations, with the discrepancy growing rapidly with the overtone number. Moreover, beginning with the second overtone, we observe a striking phenomenon: the real part of the frequency tends to zero quickly as the non-minimal coupling constant increases. This combination of spectral stability in the fundamental mode and high sensitivity of the overtones suggests that the Yang-Mills contribution primarily deforms the metric in the near-horizon region, while the geometry quickly transitions back to a Schwarzschild-like form at larger radii. In addition, we compute the grey-body factors and confirm that they represent a more stable characteristic of the geometry, exhibiting a correspondence with quasinormal modes already at the first multipole. The Yang-Mills coupling enhances the grey-body factors, further increasing the transmission probability.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Can the sound horizon-free measurement of $H_0$ constrain early new physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sound horizon-independent $H_0$ extracted by using galaxy clustering surveys data through, e.g., EFTofLSS or ShapeFit analyses, is considered to have the potential to constrain the early new physics responsible for solving the Hubble tension. Recent observations, e.g. DESI, have shown that the sound horizon-independent measurement of $H_0$ is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we clarify some potential misuses and misinterpretations in these analyses. On the one hand, imposing some prior from other cosmological probes is often used to strengthen the constraints on the results, however, these priors are usually derived using the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM, it is not suitable to apply these so-called $\Lambda$CDM priors (e.g., the $n_s$ prior from CMB), which would bias the results, to early new physics because these early new physics are usually accompanied by shifts of the $\Lambda$CDM parameters. On the other hand, the constraints on $H_0$ in the sound horizon-independent EFTofLSS analysis arise from not only the shape of the power spectrum ($k_\text{eq}$-based $H_0$), but also the overall amplitude (when combined with CMB lensing observations) and the relative amplitudes of the BAO wiggles, thus besides $k_\text{eq}$ other information may also play a role in constraining $H_0$. We also make forecasts for an Euclid-like survey, which suggest that ongoing observations will also have difficulty constraining early new physics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave lensing: probing Fuzzy Dark Matter with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a universal phenomenon: it affects both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic signals travelling through the gravitational field of a massive object. In this work, we explore the prospects of observing lensed GW signals from the mergers of massive black holes, lensed by dark matter halos composed of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), which form dense cores known as solitons. We focus on wave optics phenomena, where frequency-dependent signatures can be observed in the weak lensing regime (i.e. single-image). Our results show that lensing diffraction signatures differ for low-mass halos in FDM, and can reveal the presence of a solitonic core. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FDM and cold dark matter profiles can be distinguished in GW signals from binary massive black hole mergers, which will be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. However, the dense solitonic core does not substantially enhance the detectability of FDM halos at large source-lens offsets, relative to standard cold dark matter. Our analysis confirms FDM halos as a promising signature of dark matter on GW observations</description>

      <title>Can black holes preserve $N &gt; 4$ supersymmetry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of near-BPS black holes are governed by the breaking of the conformal symmetry that emerges near their horizons. Using the classification of superconformal symmetries, we systematically classify and quantize all effective theories that can arise in the near-BPS limit of black holes. Using these results, we argue, under certain physical assumptions, that BPS black holes cannot preserve more than four supercharges. This conclusion is consistent with existing constructions in string theory.</description>

      <title>A Cyclical Baryonic Big Bang Explains the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9810351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our universe has multiple examples of unexplained gravitational losses in black holes and neutron stars. The smallest black holes of about 4 solar masses means the maximum baryon density \rho \approx 10^{17} grams/cm^3. Any collapse of the universe will stop with a scale factor \approx 10^{13} cm. and radiation energy \approx 10 GeV. Due to higher squeezed core baryons, the outer part of the mass transferred energy to the core and became dark matter. After contraction reduced particle motion and gravitation, the core radiation energy propelled pieces of the shell into the universe. Each of these masses captured hot core gases according to its gravitational size, forming proto-galaxies. A cold shell and a hot core explain the Planck spectrum and large galaxy formation in the early universe. Thus the universe was never radiation dominant.The universe will remain cyclical as any increase in entropy of matter will be crushed back to neutrons during the contraction phase.</description>
