      <title>Rapid protoplanet formation in vortices: three-dimensional local simulations with selfgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disk vortices, seen in numerical simulations of protoplanetary disks and found observationally in ALMA and VLA images of these objects, are promising sites for planet formation given their pebble trapping abilities. Previous works have shown strong concentration of pebbles in vortices, but gravitational collapse has only been shown in low-resolution, two-dimensional, global models. In this letter, we aim to study the pebble concentration and gravitational collapse of pebble clouds in vortices via high-resolution, three-dimensional, local models. We performed simulations of the dynamics of gas and solids in a local shearing box where the gas is subject to convective overstability, generating a persistent giant vortex. We find that the vortex produces objects of Moon and Mars mass, with mass function of power law $d\ln N/d\ln M=-1.6\pm 0.3$. The protoplanets grow rapidly, doubling in mass in about 5 orbits, following pebble accretion rates. The mass range and mass doubling rate are in broad agreement with previous low resolution global models. We conclude that Mars-mass planetary embryos are the natural outcome of planet formation inside the disk vortices seen in millimeter and radio images of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>New ephemerides and detection of transit-timing variations in the K2-138 system using high-precision CHEOPS photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-planet systems are a perfect laboratory for constraining planetary formation models. A few of these systems present planets that come very close to mean motion resonance, potentially leading to significant transit-timing variations (TTVs) due to their gravitational interactions. Of these systems, K2-138 represents a excellent laboratory for studying the dynamics of its six small planets (with radii ranging between $\sim1.5$ -- $3.3 R_\oplus$), as the five innermost planets are in a near 3:2 resonant chain. In this work, we aim to constrain the orbital properties of the six planets in the K2-138 system by monitoring their transits with CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS). We also seek to use this new data to lead a TTV study on this system. We obtained twelve light curves of the system with transits of planets $d$, $e$, $f,$ and $g$. With these data, we were able to update the ephemerides of the transits for these planets and search for timing transit variations. With our measurements, we reduced the uncertainties in the orbital periods of the studied planets, typically by an order of magnitude. This allowed us to correct for large deviations, on the order of hours, in the transit times predicted by previous studies. This is key to enabling future reliable observations of the planetary transits in the system. We also highlight the presence of potential TTVs ranging from 10 minutes to as many as 60 minutes for planet $d$.</description>

      <title>Photometry of comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 in 2012-2019</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of photometrical observations of comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 is presented. The broadband observations were carried out for 15 nights from 2012 to 2019 at the Lisnyky observational station of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. Apparent magnitudes and dust productivity level $Af\rho$ in filter R were calculated. Middle and height dust activity of the comet is characterized by parameter $Af\rho$ which varied from 1246 to 17563 cm during all periods of observation. Based on the morphological analysis, four jet-like structures were detected in the coma on almost all dates. Using the geometrical model for the jet structure interpretation during all observation sets, we obtained following results: the nucleus rotation periodof 57\pm2 days, the rotational axis orientation, the locations of active regions for four jet-like structures within a narrow belt near the equator.</description>

      <title>Broadening the Canonical Picture of EUV-Driven Photoevaporation of Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoevaporation driven by hydrogen-ionizing radiation, also known as extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), profoundly shapes the lives of diverse astrophysical objects. Focusing here mainly on the dispersal of protoplanetary disks, we construct an analytical model accounting for the finite timescales of photoheating and photoionization. The model offers improved estimates for the ionization, temperature, and velocity structures versus distance from the central source, for a given EUV emission rate and spectral hardness. Compared to the classical picture of fully-ionized and isothermal winds with temperatures $\approx 10^4{\rm \,K}$ and speeds $\approx 10{\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$, our model unveils broader hydrodynamical and thermochemical states of photoevaporative winds. In contrast to the classical picture, T~Tauri stars with EUV luminosities around $10^{30}{\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}}$ have non-isothermal ionized winds at lower temperatures than the classical value if the spectrum is soft, with an average deposited energy per photoionization less than about 3.7\,eV. Conversely, if the spectrum is hard, the winds tend to be atomic and isothermal at most radii in the disk. For lower EUV intensities, even with soft spectra, atomic winds can emerge beyond $\sim 10{\, \rm au}$ through advection. We demonstrate that the analytical model's predictions are in general agreement with detailed radiation-hydrodynamics calculations. The model furthermore illustrates how the energy efficiency of photoevaporation varies with the intensity and spectral hardness of the EUV illumination, as well as addressing discrepancies in the literature around the effectiveness of X-ray photoevaporation. These findings highlight the importance of considering the finite timescales of photoheating and photoionization, both in modeling and in interpreting observational data.</description>

      <title>White dwarf constraints on geological processes at the population level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf atmospheres are frequently polluted by material from their own planetary systems. Absorption features from Ca, Mg, Fe and other elements can provide unique insights into the provenance of this exoplanetary material, with their relative abundances being used to infer accretion of material with core- or mantle-like composition. Across the population of white dwarfs, the distribution of compositions reveals the prevalence of geological and collisional processing across exoplanetary systems. By predicting the distribution of compositions in three evolutionary scenarios, this work assesses whether they can explain current observations. We consider evolution in an asteroid belt analog, in which collisions between planetary bodies that formed an iron core lead to core- or mantle-rich fragments. We also consider layer-by-layer accretion of individual bodies, such that the apparent composition of atmospheric pollution changes during the accretion of a single body. Finally, we consider that compositional spread is due to random noise. We find that the distribution of Ca, Fe and Mg in a sample of 202 cool DZs is consistent with the random noise scenario, although 7 individual systems show strong evidence of core-mantle differentiation from additional elements and/or low noise levels. Future surveys which detect multiple elements in each of a few hundred white dwarfs, with well understood biases, have the potential to confidently distinguish between the three models.</description>

      <title>14 New Light Curves and an Updated Ephemeris for the Hot Jupiter HAT-P-54 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present an analysis of 14 transit light curves of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-54 b. Thirteen of our datasets were obtained with the 6-inch MicroObservatory telescope, Cecilia, and one was measured with the 61-inch Kuiper Telescope. We used the EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code (EXOTIC) to reduce 49 datasets in order to update the planet's ephemeris to a mid-transit time of 2460216.95257 +/- 0.00022 BJD_TBD and an updated orbital period of 3.79985363 +/- 0.00000037 days. These results improve the mid-transit uncertainty by 70.27% from the most recent ephemeris update. The updated mid-transit time can help to ensure the efficient use of expensive, large ground- and space-based telescope missions in the future. This result demonstrates that amateur astronomers and citizen scientists can provide meaningful, cost-efficient, crowd-sourcing observations using ground-based telescopes to further refine current mid-transit times and orbital periods.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Solar Differential Rotation by Absolutely Calibrated Iodine-Cell Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iodine-cell technique, which is known to be efficient in precisely establishing Doppler velocity shifts, was once applied by the author to measuring the solar differential rotation based on full-disk spectroscopic observations (Takeda and Ueno, Sol. Phys. 270, 447, 2011). However, the data reduction procedure (in simple analogy with the stellar case) adopted therein was not necessarily adequate, because specific characteristic involved with the disk-resolved Sun (i.e., center-limb variation of line strengths) was not properly taken into consideration. Therefore, this problem is revisited based on the same data but with an application to theoretical spectrum fitting, which can yield absolute heliocentric radial velocities (v_obs) in a consistent manner as shown in the study of solar gravitational redshift (Takeda and Ueno, Sol. Phys. 281, 551, 2012). Likewise, instead of converting v_obs into omega (angular velocity) at each disk point, which suffers considerable errors especially near the central meridian, omega was derived this time by applying the least squares analysis to a dataset comprising v_obs values at many points. This new analysis resulted in omega (deg/day) = 13.92 (+/- 0.03) -1.69(+/- 0.34)(sin psi)^2 -2.37(+/- 0.62) (sin psi)^4 (psi: the heliographic latitude) along with the gravitational redshift of 675 m/s, which are favorably compared with previous publications. In addition, how the distribution of observing points on the disk affects the result is also examined, which reveals that rotation parameters may suffer appreciable errors depending on cases.</description>

      <title>The Incompressible Magnetohydrodynamic Energy Cascade Rate Upstream of Mars: Effects of the Total Energy and the Cross-Helicity on Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar wind turbulence is a dynamical phenomenon that evolves with heliocentric distance. Orbiting Mars since September 2014, Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) offers a unique opportunity to explore some of its main properties beyond ~1.38 au. Here, we analyze solar wind turbulence upstream of Mars's bow shock, utilizing more than five years of magnetic field and plasma measurements. This analysis is based on two complementary methodologies: 1) the computation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) invariants characterizing incompressible fluctuations; 2) the estimation of the incompressible energy cascade rate at MHD scales (i.e., $\langle\varepsilon^{T}\rangle_{MHD}$). Our results show the solar wind incompressible fluctuations are primarily in a magnetically dominated regime, with the component travelling away from the Sun having a higher median pseudo-energy. Moreover, turbulent fluctuations have a total energy per mass of up to ~300 km2 s-2, a range smaller than reported at 1 au. For these conditions, we determine the probability distribution function of $\langle\varepsilon^{T}\rangle_{MHD}$ ranges mainly between ~-1x10-16 and ~1x10-16 J m-3 s-1, with a median equal to -1.8x10-18 J m-3 s-1, suggesting back-transfer of energy. Our results also suggest that $|\langle\varepsilon^{T}\rangle_{MHD}|$ is correlated with the total energy per mass of fluctuations and that the median of $\langle\varepsilon^{T}\rangle_{MHD}$ does not vary significantly with the cross-helicity. We find, however, that the medians of the inward and outward pseudo-energy cascade rates vary with the solar wind cross-helicity. Finally, we discuss these results and their implications for future studies that can provide further insight into the factors affecting solar wind energy transfer rate.</description>

      <title>Carbon Isotope Fractionation of Complex Organic Molecules in Star-Forming Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($&gt;$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.</description>
