      <title>Leader Selection and Follower Association for UE-centric Distributed Learning in Future Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User equipment (UE) devices with high compute performance acting on data with dynamic and stochastic nature to train Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) models call for real-time, agile distributed machine learning (DL) algorithms. Consequently, we focus on UE-centric DL algorithms where UEs initiate requests to adapt AI/ML models for better performance, e.g., locally refined AI/ML models among a set of headsets or smartphones. This new setup requires selecting a set of UEs as aggregators (here called leaders) and another set as followers, where all UEs update their models based on their local data, and followers share theirs with leaders for aggregation. From a networking perspective, the first question is how to select leaders and associate followers efficiently. This results in a high dimensional mixed integer programming problem and involves internal UE state information and state information among UEs, called external state information in this paper. To address this challenge, we introduce two new indices: a Leader Internal Index (LII), which is a function of the internal states of each device, demonstrating the willingness to be a leader such as battery life and AI/hardware accelerators, and a Leader eXternal Index (LXI), which is a function of external state information among UEs, such as trust, channel condition, and any aspect relevant for associating a follower with a leader. These two indices transform the highly complex leader selection and follower association problem into a better tractable formulation. More importantly, LIIs and LXIs allow to keep the internal and external state information of this problem inside of each device without compromising users' privacy.</description>

      <title>Online and Utility-Power Efficient Task Scheduling in Homogeneous Fog Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fog computing is of particular interest to Internet of Things (IoT), where inexpensive simple devices can offload their computation tasks to nearby Fog Nodes. Online scheduling in such fog networks is challenging due to stochastic network states such as task arrivals, wireless channels and location of nodes. In this paper, we focus on the problem of optimizing computation offloading management, arrival data admission control and resource scheduling, in order to improve the overall system performance, in terms of throughput fairness, power efficiency, and average mean of queue backlogs. We investigate this problem for a fog network with homogeneous mobile Fog Nodes, serving multiple wireless devices, controlled by a Fog Control Node. By formulating the problem as a stochastic optimization problem, maximizing utility-power efficiency, defined as achievable utility per-unit power consumption, subject to queue backlog stability, we modify Lyapunov optimization techniques to deal with the fractional form of utility-power efficiency function. Then we propose an online utility-power efficient task scheduling algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal. Our online task scheduling algorithm can achieve the theoretical [O(1/V), O(V)] trade-off between utility-power efficiency and average mean of queue backlogs,</description>

      <title>Enhancing Spectrum Efficiency in 6G Satellite Networks: A GAIL-Powered Policy Learning via Asynchronous Federated Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL)-powered policy learning approach is proposed for optimizing beamforming, spectrum allocation, and remote user equipment (RUE) association in NTNs. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods for wireless network optimization often rely on manually designed reward functions, which can require extensive parameter tuning. To overcome these limitations, we employ inverse RL (IRL), specifically leveraging the GAIL framework, to automatically learn reward functions without manual design. We augment this framework with an asynchronous federated learning approach, enabling decentralized multi-satellite systems to collaboratively derive optimal policies. The proposed method aims to maximize spectrum efficiency (SE) while meeting minimum information rate requirements for RUEs. To address the non-convex, NP-hard nature of this problem, we combine the many-to-one matching theory with a multi-agent asynchronous federated IRL (MA-AFIRL) framework. This allows agents to learn through asynchronous environmental interactions, improving training efficiency and scalability. The expert policy is generated using the Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), providing data to train the automatic reward function within GAIL. Simulation results show that the proposed MA-AFIRL method outperforms traditional RL approaches, achieving a $14.6\%$ improvement in convergence and reward value. The novel GAIL-driven policy learning establishes a novel benchmark for 6G NTN optimization.</description>

      <title>Physically Consistent RIS: From Reradiation Mode Optimization to Practical Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a practical framework for designing a physically consistent reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to overcome the inefficiency of the conventional phase gradient approach. For a section of Cape Town and across three different coverage enhancement scenarios, we optimize the amplitude of the RIS reradiation modes using Sionna ray tracing and a gradient-based learning technique. We then determine the required RIS surface/sheet impedance given the desired amplitudes for the reradiation modes, design the corresponding unitcells, and validate the performance through full-wave numerical simulations using CST Microwave Studio. We further validate our approach by fabricating a RIS using the parallel plate waveguide technique and conducting experimental measurements that align with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Towards Event-Triggered NMPC for Efficient 6G Communications: Experimental Results and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked control systems enable real-time control and coordination of distributed systems, leveraging the low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity offered by 5G and future 6G networks. Applications include autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and smart grids. Despite networked control algorithms admitting nominal stability guarantees even in the presence of delays and packet dropouts, their practical performance still heavily depends on the specific characteristics and conditions of the underlying network. To achieve the desired performance while efficiently using communication resources, co-design of control and communication is pivotal. Although periodic schemes, where communication instances are fixed, can provide reliable control performance, unnecessary transmissions, when updates are not needed, result in inefficient usage of network resources. In this paper, we investigate the potential for co-design of model predictive control and network communication. To this end, we design and implement an event-triggered nonlinear model predictive controller for stabilizing a Furuta pendulum communicating over a tailored open radio access network 6G research platform. We analyze the control performance as well as network utilization under varying channel conditions and event-triggering criteria. Our results show that the event-triggered control scheme achieves similar performance to periodic control with reduced communication demand.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Challenges in Network Intrusion Detection Systems: Research Insights and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has brought significant advances in cybersecurity, particularly in the area of intrusion detection systems. This improvements can be mostly attributed to the ability of machine learning algorithms to identify complex relations between features in the data and to generalize well to unseen samples. Deep neural networks in particular contributed to this progress by enabling the analysis of large amounts of training data, significantly enhancing detection performance. However, machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: manipulations of input data designed to mislead the models into making incorrect predictions. While much attention has been given to adversarial threats in unstructured data such as text and images, their effectiveness in structured data such as network traffic has not been as thoroughly explored.
  This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing an critical review of machine learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and a thorough analysis of their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We critically review existing NIDS research, highlighting key trends, strengths, and limitations, and we identify gaps in understanding that require further exploration. We further discuss emerging challenges and offer insights for developing more robust and resilient NIDS models. In summary, this paper aims to enhance understanding of adversarial attacks and defenses in NIDS and guide future research in improving the robustness of machine learning models in cybersecurity applications.</description>

      <title>A QoS-Aware Uplink Spectrum and Power Allocation with Link Adaptation for Vehicular Communications in 5G networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have proposed link adaptation-based joint spectrum and power allocation algorithms for the uplink communication in 5G Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) systems. In C-V2X, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) users share radio resources with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) users. Existing works primarily focus on the optimal pairing of V2V and V2I users, assuming that each V2I user needs a single resource block (RB) while minimizing interference through power allocation. In contrast, in this work, we have considered that the number of RBs needed by the users is a function of their channel condition and Quality of Service (QoS) - a method called link adaptation. It effectively compensates for the frequent channel quality fluctuations at the high frequencies of 5G communication.5G uses a multi-numerology frame structure to support diverse QoS requirements, which has also been considered in this work.
  The first algorithm proposed in this article greedily allocates RBs to V2I users using link adaptation. It then uses the Hungarian algorithm to pair V2V with V2I users while minimizing interference through power allocation. The second proposed method groups RBs into resource chunks (RCs) and uses the Hungarian algorithm twice - first to allocate RCs to V2I users and then to pair V2I users with V2V users. Extensive simulations reveal that link adaptation increases the number of satisfied V2I users and their sum rate while also improving the QoS of V2I and V2V users, making it indispensable for 5G C-V2X systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Energy Consumption of a Mobile Robotic Platform for Sustainable Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of wireless devices requires flexible network infrastructures to meet the increasing Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Mobile Robotic Platforms (MRPs) acting as mobile communications cells are a promising solution to provide on-demand wireless connectivity in dynamic networking scenarios. However, the energy consumption of MRPs is a challenge that must be considered to maximize the availability of the wireless networks created.
  The main contribution of this paper is the experimental evaluation of the energy consumption of an MRP acting as a mobile communications cell. The evaluation considers different actions performed by a real MRP, demonstrating that energy consumption varies significantly with the type of action performed. The results obtained pave the way for optimizing MRP movement in dynamic networking scenarios, maximizing wireless network's availability while minimizing the MRP energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Adaptive Bitrate Algorithms for Virtual Reality Streaming over Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive Virtual Reality (VR) streaming over Wi-Fi networks encounters significant challenges due to bandwidth fluctuations caused by channel contention and user mobility. Adaptive BitRate (ABR) algorithms dynamically adjust the video encoding bitrate based on the available network capacity, aiming to maximize image quality while mitigating congestion and preserving the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we experiment with ABR algorithms for VR streaming using Air Light VR (ALVR), an open-source VR streaming solution. We extend ALVR with a comprehensive set of metrics that provide a robust characterization of the network's state, enabling more informed bitrate adjustments. To demonstrate the utility of these performance indicators, we develop and test the Network-aware Step-wise ABR algorithm for VR streaming (NeSt-VR). Results validate the accuracy of the newly implemented network performance metrics and demonstrate NeSt-VR's video bitrate adaptation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Lens: A Foundation Model for Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03646v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network traffic refers to the amount of data being sent and received over the internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic is challenging due to the diverse nature of data packets, which often feature heterogeneous headers and encrypted payloads lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the Transformer encoder or decoder to learn the representations from massive traffic data. However, these methods typically excel in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundation model for network traffic that leverages the T5 architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from raw data. To further enhance pre-training effectiveness, we design a novel loss that combines three distinct tasks: Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and generation. Notably, it also requires much less labeled data for fine-tuning compared to current methods.</description>
