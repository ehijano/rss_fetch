      <title>Near-Optimal Dropout-Robust Sortition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citizens' assemblies - small panels of citizens that convene to deliberate on policy issues - often face the issue of panelists dropping out at the last-minute. Without intervention, these dropouts compromise the size and representativeness of the panel, prompting the question: Without seeing the dropouts ahead of time, can we choose panelists such that after dropouts, the panel will be representative and appropriately-sized? We model this problem as a minimax game: the minimizer aims to choose a panel that minimizes the loss, i.e., the deviation of the ultimate panel from predefined representation targets. Then, an adversary defines a distribution over dropouts from which the realized dropouts are drawn. Our main contribution is an efficient loss-minimizing algorithm, which remains optimal as we vary the maximizer's power from worst case to average case. Our algorithm - which iteratively plays a projected gradient descent subroutine against an efficient algorithm for computing the best-response dropout distribution - also addresses a key open question in the area: how to manage dropouts while ensuring that each potential panelist is chosen with relatively equal probabilities. Using real-world datasets, we compare our algorithms to existing benchmarks, and we offer the first characterizations of tradeoffs between robustness, loss, and equality in this problem.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Latency on a Progressive Second-Price Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progressive second-price auction of Lazar and Semret is a decentralized mechanism for the allocation and real-time pricing of a divisible resource. Our focus is on how delays in the receipt of bid messages, asynchronous analysis by buyers of the market and randomness in the initial bids affect the $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria obtained by the method of truthful $\varepsilon$-best reply. We introduce an algorithm for finding minimal-revenue equilibrium states and then show that setting a reserve price just below clearing stabilizes seller revenue while maintaining efficiency. Utility is of primary interest given the assumption of elastic demand. Although some buyers experienced unpredictability in the value and cost of their individual allocations, their respective utilities were predictable.</description>

      <title>Vector Cost Behavioral Planning for Autonomous Robotic Systems with Contemporary Validation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vector cost bimatrix game is a method for multi-objective decision making that enables autonomous robotic systems to optimize for multiple goals at once while avoiding worst-case scenarios in neglected objectives. We expand this approach to arbitrary numbers of objectives and compare its performance to scalar weighted sum methods during competitive motion planning. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) software is used to aid in the analysis of high dimensional decision-making data. State-space Exploration of Multidimensional Boundaries using Adherence Strategies (SEMBAS) is applied to explore performance modes in the parameter space as a sensitivity study for the baseline and proposed frameworks. While some works have explored aspects of game theoretic planning and intelligent systems validation separately, we combine each of these into a novel and comprehensive simulation pipeline. This integration demonstrates a dramatic improvement of the vector cost method over scalarization and offers an interpretable and generalizable framework for robotic behavioral planning.

      <title>Promises Made, Promises Kept: Safe Pareto Improvements via Ex Post Verifiable Commitments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A safe Pareto improvement (SPI) [41] is a modification of a game that leaves all players better off with certainty. SPIs are typically proven under qualitative assumptions about the way different games are played. For example, we assume that strictly dominated strategies can be iteratively removed and that isomorphic games are played isomorphically. In this work, we study SPIs achieved through three types of ex post verifiable commitments -- promises about player behavior from which deviations can be detected by observing the game. First, we consider disarmament -- commitments not to play certain actions. Next, we consider SPIs based on token games. A token game is a game played by simply announcing an action (via cheap talk). As such, its outcome is intrinsically meaningless. However, we assume the players commit in advance to play specific (pure or correlated) strategy profiles in the original game as a function of the token game outcome. Under such commitments, the token game becomes a new, meaningful normal-form game. Finally, we consider default-conditional commitment: SPIs in settings where the players' default ways of playing the original game can be credibly revealed and hence the players can commit to act as a function of this default. We characterize the complexity of deciding whether SPIs exist in all three settings, giving a mixture of characterizations and efficient algorithms and NP- and Graph Isomorphism-hardness results.</description>

      <title>Steering Noncooperative Games Through Conjecture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dynamic noncooperative games, each player makes conjectures about other players' reactions before choosing a strategy. However, resulting equilibria may be multiple and do not always lead to desirable outcomes. These issues are typically addressed separately, for example, through opponent modelling and incentive design. Drawing inspiration from conjectural variations games, we propose an incentive design framework in which a coordinator first computes an equilibrium by optimizing a predefined objective function, then communicates this equilibrium as a target for the players to reach. In a centralized setting, the coordinator also optimizes the conjectures to steer the players towards the target. In decentralized settings, players independently compute conjectures and update their strategies based on individual targets. We provide a guarantee of equilibrium existence in both cases. This framework uses conjectures not only to guide the system towards desirable outcomes but also to decouple the game into independent optimization problems, enabling efficient computation and parallelization in large-scale settings. We illustrate our theoretical results on classical representative noncooperative games, demonstrating its application potential.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategy in "Guess Who?": Beyond Binary Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:1509.03327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Guess Who?" is a popular two player game where players ask "Yes"/"No" questions to search for their opponent's secret identity from a pool of possible candidates. This is modeled as a simple stochastic game. Using this model, the optimal strategy is explicitly found. Contrary to popular belief, performing a binary search is \emph{not} always optimal. Instead, the optimal strategy for the player who trails is to make certain bold plays in an attempt catch up. This is discovered by first analyzing a continuous version of the game where players play indefinitely and the winner is never decided after finitely many rounds.</description>
