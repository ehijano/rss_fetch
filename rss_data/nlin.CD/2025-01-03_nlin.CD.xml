      <title>Dynamics of Pendulum Forced by a Magnetic Excitation with Position-Dependent Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of a magnetic pendulum under time-varying magnetic excitation with a position-dependent phase. The system exhibits complex chaotic and regular dynamics, validated through simulations and experiments. The mathematical model, based on a physical setup, includes a magnetic excitation torque with phase dependence on the dynamic variable. Bifurcation analyses confirm the rich multistability of the system, showcasing periodic attractors, period-doubling bifurcations, and chaotic behavior. Experimental validation demonstrates a high agreement between numerical and experimental results, supporting the efficacy of the proposed model. The study sheds light on the system's sensitivity to changes in magnetic interaction, providing insights into controlling resonance energy exchange in coupled magnetic pendulum systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and averaging in partially hyperbolic systems with fast and slow variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of dynamical systems obtained by coupling an Anosov map on the two-dimensional torus -- the chaotic system -- with the identity map on the one-dimensional torus -- the neutral system -- through a dissipative interaction. We show that the two systems synchronize: the trajectories evolve toward an attracting invariant manifold, and the full dynamics is conjugated to its linearization around the invariant manifold. As a byproduct, we obtain that there exists a unique exponentially mixing physical measure. When the interaction is small, the evolution of the variable which describes the neutral system is very close to the identity; hence, it appears as a slow variable with respect to the variable which describes the chaotic system, and which is wherefore named the fast variable. We demonstrate that, seen on a suitably long time scale, the slow variable effectively follows the solution of a deterministic differential equation obtained by averaging over the fast variable. More precisely, we prove that the invariant manifold is in probability close to the fixed point of the averaged dynamics and that the difference between the exact evolution of the slow variable, seen from the invariant manifold, and its averaged evolution is in probability exponentially decreasing for arbitrarily large times.</description>

      <title>Longons from the nonlinear dispersion of Galerkin regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08583v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irregular compactons and peakons from some nonlinear dispersions can be regularized by another type of nonlinear dispersion, defined by a pseudo-differential operator in physical space for the Galerkin truncation preserving finite Fourier modes of wavenumbers no larger than $K$. This resembles yet differs from the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) regularization of the Burgers-Hopf (BH) equation. The Galerkin-regularized compacton, peakon, KdV, and BH dynamics exhibit novel traveling waves and interacting solitonic structures amidst weaker, less-ordered components (`longons'). Quasi-periodic solutions are also constructed with on-torus invariants, towards a potential Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) argument with presumably whiskered tori. The latter are persistent against the approximation of the truncation by a type of linear dispersion models, resulting in similar longulent states. Time-dependent and stationary behaviors in the large-$K$ limit are addressed with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</description>
