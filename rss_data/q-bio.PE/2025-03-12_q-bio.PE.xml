      <title>Dynamical behavior and bifurcation analysis for a theoretical model of dengue fever transmission with incubation period and delayed recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As offered by the World Health Organisation (WHO), close to half of the population in the world's resides in dengue-risk zones. Dengue viruses are transmitted to individuals by Aedes mosquito species infected bite (Ae. Albopictus of Ae. aegypti). These mosquitoes can transmit other viruses, including Zika and Chikungunya. In this research, a mathematical model is formulated to reflect different time delays considered in both extrinsic and intrinsic incubation periods, as well as in the recovery periods of infectious individuals. Preliminary results for the non-delayed model including positivity and boundedness of solutions, non-dimensionalization and equalibria analysis are presented. The threshold parameter (reproduction number) of the model is obtained via next generation matrix schemes. The stability analysis of the model revealed that various dynamical behaviour can be observed depending on delay parameters, where in particular the effect of delay in the recovery time of infectious individuals may lead to substantial changes in the dynamics. The ideas presented in this paper can be applied to other infectious diseases, providing qualitative evaluations for understanding time delays influencing the transmission dynamics.</description>

      <title>A non-homogeneous Markov early epidemic growth dynamics model. Application to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new markovian stochastic model that can be described as a non-homogeneous Pure Birth process. We propose a functional form of birth rate that depends on the number of individuals in the population and on the elapsed time, allowing us to model a contagion effect. Thus, we model the early stages of an epidemic. The number of individuals then becomes the infectious cases and the birth rate becomes the incidence rate. We obtain this way a process that depends on two competitive phenomena, infection and immunization. Variations in those rates allow us to monitor how effective the actions taken by government and health organizations are. From our model, three useful indicators for the epidemic evolution over time are obtained: the immunization rate, the infection/immunization ratio and the mean time between infections (MTBI). The proposed model allows either positive or negative concavities for the mean value curve, provided the infection/immunization ratio is either greater or less than one. We apply this model to the present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still in its early growth stage in Latin American countries. As it is shown, the model accomplishes a good fit for the real number of both positive cases and deaths. We analyze the evolution of the three indicators for several countries and perform a comparative study between them. Important conclusions are obtained from this analysis.</description>

      <title>Plant species richness prediction from DESIS hyperspectral data: A comparison study on feature extraction procedures and regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diversity of terrestrial vascular plants plays a key role in maintaining the stability and productivity of ecosystems. Airborne hyperspectral imaging has shown promise for measuring plant diversity remotely, but to operationalise these efforts over large regions we need to advance satellite-based alternatives. The advanced spectral and spatial specification of the recently launched DESIS (the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) instrument provides a unique opportunity to test the potential for monitoring plant species diversity with spaceborne hyperspectral data. This study provides a quantitative assessment on the ability of DESIS hyperspectral data for predicting plant species richness in two different habitat types in southeast Australia. Spectral features were first extracted from the DESIS spectra, then regressed against on-ground estimates of plant species richness, with a two-fold cross validation scheme to assess the predictive performance. We tested and compared the effectiveness of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and Partial Least Squares analysis (PLS) for feature extraction, and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR) for species richness prediction. The best prediction results were $r=0.76$ and $\text{RMSE}=5.89$ for the Southern Tablelands region, and $r=0.68$ and $\text{RMSE}=5.95$ for the Snowy Mountains region. Relative importance analysis for the DESIS spectral bands showed that the red-edge, red, and blue spectral regions were more important for predicting plant species richness than the green bands and the near-infrared bands beyond red-edge. We also found that the DESIS hyperspectral data performed better than Sentinel-2 multispectral data in the prediction of plant species richness.</description>
