      <title>Dimensions and metric dyadic cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we provide equivalent definitions for fractal geometric dimensions through dyadic cube constructions. Given a metric space $X$ with finite Assouad dimension, i.e., satisfying the doubling property, we show that the construction of systems of dyadic cubes by Hyt\"onen-Kairema is compatible with many dimensions. In particular, the Hausdorff, Minkowski, and Assouad dimensions can be equivalently expressed solely using dyadic cubes in the aforementioned system. The same is true for the Assouad spectrum, a collection of dimensions introduced by Fraser-Yu.</description>

      <title>Sylvester's problem for beta-type distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider $d+2$ i.i.d. random points $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ in $\mathbb R^d$. In this short note we compute the probability that their convex hull is a simplex in the following three cases: (i) the distribution of $X_1$ is multivariate standard normal; (ii) the density of $X_1$ is proportional to $(1-\|x\|^2)^{\beta}$ on the unit ball (beta distribution); (iii) the density of $X_1$ is proportional to $(1+\|x\|^2)^{-\beta}$ (beta prime distribution). In the normal case, the above probability is twice the sum of solid angles of a regular $(d+1)$-dimensional simplex.</description>

      <title>Strongly self-dual polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to study the class of strongly self-dual polytopes (ssd-polytopes for short), defined in a paper by Lov\'asz \cite{lovasz}. He described a series of such polytopes (called $L$-type polytopes), which he used to solve a combinatorial problem. From a geometrical point of view, there are interesting questions: what additional elements of this class exist, and are there any with a different structure from the $L$-type ones? We show that in dimension three, one of their faces defines $L$-type polyhedra. Illustrating the algorithm of the proof, we present an ssd-polytope of 23 vertices whose combinatorial structure differ from those of $L$-type ones. Finally, with an elementary discussion, we prove that for fewer than nine vertices, there are only fifth one ssd-polyhedra, four of them can be constructed by Lov\'asz's method, and we can find the fifth one with "the diameter gradient flow algorithm" of Katz, Memoli and Wang \cite{katz-memoli-wang}.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Sylvester problem: Probabilities of combinatorial types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ be random points in $\mathbb R^d$. The classical Sylvester problem asks to determine the probability that the convex hull of these points, denoted by $P:= [X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}]$, is a simplex. In the present paper, we study a refined version of this problem which asks to determine the probability that $P$ has a given combinatorial type. It is known that there are $\lfloor d/2\rfloor+1$ possible combinatorial types of simplicial $d$-dimensional polytopes with at most $d+2$ vertices. These types are denoted by $T_0^d, T_1^d, \ldots, T_{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^d$, where $T_0^d$ is a simplex with $d+1$ vertices, while the remaining types have exactly $d+2$ vertices. Our aim is thus to compute the probability $$ p_{d,m} := \mathbb P[P \text{ is of type } T_{m}^d], \qquad m\in \{0,1,\ldots, \lfloor d/2 \rfloor\}. $$ The classical Sylvester problem corresponds to the case $m=0$. We shall compute $p_{d,m}$ for all $m$ in the following cases: (a) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ are i.i.d. normal; (b) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ follow a $d$-dimensional beta or beta prime distribution, which includes the uniform distribution on the ball or on the sphere as special cases; (c) $X_1,\ldots, X_{d+2}$ form a random walk with symmetrically exchangeable increments. As a by-product of case (a) we recover a recent solution to Youden's demon problem which asks to determine the probability that, in a one-dimensional i.i.d. normal sample $\xi_1,\ldots, \xi_n$, the empirical mean $\frac 1n (\xi_1 + \ldots + \xi_n)$ lies between the $k$-th and the $(k+1)$-st order statistics. We also consider the conic (or spherical) version of the refined Sylvester problem and solve it in several special cases.</description>

      <title>Is magnitude 'generically continuous' for finite metric spaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnitude is a real-valued invariant of metric spaces which, in the finite setting, can be understood as recording the 'effective number of points' in a space as the scale of the metric varies. Motivated by applications in topological data analysis, this paper investigates the stability of magnitude: its continuity properties with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. We show that magnitude is nowhere continuous on the Gromov-Hausdorff space of finite metric spaces. Yet, we find evidence to suggest that it may be 'generically continuous', in the sense that generic Gromov-Hausdorff limits are preserved by magnitude. We make the case that, in fact, 'generic stability' is what matters for applicability.</description>

      <title>$\ell^p$ metrics on cell complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation that groups can be effectively studied using metric spaces modelled on $\ell^1$, $\ell^2$, and $\ell^\infty$ geometry, we consider cell complexes equipped with an $\ell^p$ metric for arbitrary $p$. Under weak conditions that can be checked locally, we establish nonpositive curvature properties of these complexes, such as Busemann-convexity and strong bolicity. We also provide detailed information on the geodesics of these metrics in the special case of CAT(0) cube complexes.</description>

      <title>A R\'enyi entropy interpretation of anti-concentration and noncentral sections of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Bobkov and Chistyakov's (2015) upper bounds on concentration functions of sums of independent random variables to a multivariate entropic setting. The approach is based on pointwise estimates on densities of sums of independent random vectors uniform on centred Euclidean balls. In this vein, we also obtain sharp bounds on volumes of noncentral sections of isotropic convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Real Gaussian exponential sums via a real moment map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expected number of solutions of a system of identically distributed exponential sums with centered Gaussian coefficient and arbitrary variance. We use the Adler and Taylor theory of Gaussian random fields to identify a moment map which allows to express the expected number of solution as an integral over the Newton polytope, in analogy with the Bernstein Khovanskii Kushnirenko Theorem. We apply this result to study the monotonicity of the expected number of solution with respect to the support of the exponential sum in an open set. We find that, when a point is added in the support in the interior of the Newton polytope there exists an open sets where the expected number of solutions decreases, answering negatively to a local version of a conjecture by B\"urgisser. When the point added in the support is far enough away from the Newton polytope we show that, in dimension 1, the number of solutions increases everywhere, while in dimension &gt;1 there is an unbounded open set where the number of solution decreases. We also prove some new lower bounds for the Aronszajn multiplication of exponential sums.</description>

      <title>Hypercube minor-universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be $m$-minor-universal if every graph with at most $m$ edges (and no isolated vertices) is a minor of $G$. We prove that the $d$-dimensional hypercube, $Q_d$, is $\Omega\left(\frac{2^d}{d}\right)$-minor-universal, and that there exists an absolute constant $C$ such that $Q_d$ is not $\frac{C2^d}{\sqrt{d}}$-minor-universal. Similar results are obtained in a more generalized setting, where we bound the size of minors in a product of finite connected graphs. We discuss future directions and pose open problems.</description>
