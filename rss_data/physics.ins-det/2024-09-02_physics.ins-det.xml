      <title>Gain-Bandwidth-Product-Induced Technical Bound in Time Transfer System without Inline Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time transfer plays a dispensable role in many fields including navigation and positioning, geodesy, and fundamental tests. However, in certain scenarios where effective relay node deployment is often not feasible, such as harsh environments with extremely poor infrastructure and emergency conditions, effective time transfer without inline amplifiers becomes crucial. In this situation, the maximum transmission distance is limited by the receiver's measurement capability, particularly its ability to amplify the signal. Here we propose a theoretical model, giving a technical lower bound of the detected signal stability at different transmission distances, induced by limited gain-bandwidth products. The results under common gain-bandwidth products show that while for shorter transmission distances, stability is mainly limited by the background noise of the time interval counter, for longer distances reaching the scale of 300 kilometers, the technical lower bound is below the level of 10 nanoseconds without any inline amplification devices. Therefore, the given technical bound offers guidance on managing the balance between distance and stability, together with the optimization of the receiver in long-distance time transfer without inline amplification.</description>

      <title>The European Strategy and Detector R&amp;D Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics stimulated the preparation of the European Detector Roadmap document in 2021 by the European Committee for Future Accelerators ECFA. This roadmap, defined during a bottom-up process by the community, outlines nine technology domains for HEP instrumentation and pinpoints urgent R&amp;D topics, known as Detector R&amp;D Themes (DRDTs). Task forces were set for each domain, leading to Detector R&amp;D Collaborations (DRDs), now hosted at CERN. After an intensive period over the last months, seven DRD collaborations have been established, which are now starting to set up their collaboration structures and begin to work. One is still in the preparation phase. In this publication, I will give an overview of the set-up process and the current status of all DRD collaborations covering detector developments in the field of gaseous detectors, noble liquid detectors for rare event searches, semiconductor detectors, photodetectors and concepts for particle ID, quantum sensors, calorimetry, electronics for HEP instrumentation and mechanical and integration aspects.</description>

      <title>Design of a CsI(Tl) Calorimeter for Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE) is proposed to search for charged lepton flavor violation and increase the sensitivity by three orders of magnitude compared to the PSI experiment in the 1990s. A clear signature of this conversion is the positron produced from antimuonium decay. This paper presents a near-$4\pi$-coverage calorimeter designed for MACE, which provides an energy resolution of 9% at 511 keV and 7.5% at 1.022 MeV. The signal efficiency for double $\gamma$ events is 67.5%. Detailed Monte-Carlo simulations using MACE offline software based on Geant4 are performed for geometry optimization, coincidence system design, background estimation, and benchmark detector validation.</description>

      <title>Precision determination of the track-position resolution of beam telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam tests using tracking telescopes are a standard method for determining the spatial resolution of detectors. This requires the precise knowledge of the position resolution of beam tracks reconstructed at the Device Under Test (DUT). A method is proposed which achieves this using a segmented silicon detector with readout with charge digitization. It is found that the DUT spatial resolution for particles with normal incidence is less than 1 $\mu$m for events where clusters consist of two pixels (or strips). Given this accuracy, the residual of the beam track-position at the DUT and the position reconstructed in the DUT provides the beam track-position resolution distribution. The method is developed using simulated events, which are also used to study how to deal with cross-talk, electronics noise, energetic $\delta $-electrons, and incident beams with a few degrees off the normal to the sensor plane. To validate the method, the position resolution of beam tracks reconstructed by the EUDET beam telescope of the DESY II Test Beam Facility is determined using a CMS Phase-2 prototype pixel sensor.</description>

      <title>Two-neutrino double electron capture of $^{124}$Xe in the first LUX-ZEPLIN exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broad physics reach of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment covers rare phenomena beyond the direct detection of dark matter. We report precise measurements of the extremely rare decay of $^{124}$Xe through the process of two-neutrino double electron capture (2$\nu$2EC), utilizing a $1.39\,\mathrm{kg} \times \mathrm{yr}$ isotopic exposure from the first LZ science run. A half-life of $T_{1/2}^{2\nu2\mathrm{EC}} = (1.09 \pm 0.14_{\text{stat}} \pm 0.05_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{22}\,\mathrm{yr}$ is observed with a statistical significance of $8.3\,\sigma$, in agreement with literature. First empirical measurements of the KK capture fraction relative to other K-shell modes were conducted, and demonstrate consistency with respect to recent signal models at the $1.4\,\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Undulators are ALP Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are known to be produced through axion-photon conversion in the presence of a stationary external magnetic field. Devices such as undulators and wigglers, which are used widely for photon production, e.g., in synchrotron radiation facilities, inherently possess strong magnetic fields, making them potential sources for ALP production. In this paper, we establish formalisms and formulas for studying ALP production in the ALP-photon-charged current system based on quantum field theory. We demonstrate that ALP production is inevitable in any undulator with the standard designs due to the electron Coulomb potential as well as a resonance effect depending on the ALP mass. In particular, ALPs are predominantly produced in a direction slightly misaligned with the photons' main direction. We propose placing detectors in the desired directions during operations of the originally planned experiments as an efficient approach to simultaneously probing ALPs. The calculation methods and formulas developed in this study are applicable to ALP production from other environments and productions of other particles beyond the standard model relevant to synchrotron radiations.</description>

      <title>Dark counts in optical superconducting transition-edge sensors for rare-event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are a type of quantum sensor known for its high single-photon detection efficiency and low background. This makes them ideal for particle physics experiments searching for rare events. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of the background in optical TESs, distinguishing three types of events: electrical-noise, high-energy, and photonlike events. We introduce computational methods to automate the classification of events. For the first time, we experimentally verify and simulate the source of the high-energy events. We also isolate the photonlike events, the expected signal in dielectric haloscopes searching for dark matter dark photons, and achieve a record-low photonlike dark-count rate of $3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz in the 0.8-3.2 eV energy range.</description>

      <title>Beam Test Performance Studies of CMS Phase-2 Outer Tracker Module Prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new tracking detector will be installed as part of the Phase-2 upgrade of the CMS detector for the high-luminosity LHC era. This tracking detector includes the Inner Tracker, equipped with silicon pixel sensor modules, and the Outer Tracker, consisting of modules with two parallel stacked silicon sensors. The Outer Tracker front-end ASICs will be able to correlate hits from charged particles in these two sensors to perform on-module discrimination of transverse momenta $p_\mathrm{T}$. The $p_\mathrm{T}$ information is generated at a frequency of 40 MHz and will be used in the Level-1 trigger decision of CMS. Prototypes of the so-called 2S modules were tested at the Test Beam Facility at DESY Hamburg between 2019 and 2020. These modules use the final front-end ASIC, the CMS Binary Chip (CBC), and for the first time the Concentrator Integrated Circuit (CIC), optical readout and on-module power conversion. In total, seven modules were tested, one of which was assembled with sensors irradiated with protons. An important aspect was to show that it is possible to read out modules synchronously. A cluster hit efficiency of about 99.75% was achieved for all modules. The CBC $p_\mathrm{T}$ discrimination mechanism has been verified to work together with the CIC and optical readout. The measured module performance meets the requirements for operation in the upgraded CMS tracking detector.</description>

      <title>Validation of Thin-foil proton recoil neutron spectrometer prototype for application in high yield DT fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of Thin-foil Proton Recoil (TPR) spectrometers for application in neutron spectroscopy is of high relevance for future fusion devices such as ITER, where neutron spectroscopy will play a crucial role in fuel content monitoring. Existing research based on simulations of the performance of TPR spectrometers at ITER has demonstrated positive results. However, experimental validation of the simulations would greatly benefit the reliability of conclusions. In this study, we designed and constructed a prototype TPR neutron spectrometer and employed a DT neutron generator as a neutron source to perform measurements. We compared the experimental results with the simulation results using the Geant4 model of the experiment. The simulation and experimental results match within silicon detector intrinsic energy resolution. This approach ensures the experimental validation of the Geant4 based simulations of the TPR spectrometer. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing nuclear reactions measured in silicon detectors, specifically $^{28}$Si(n,d) and $^{28}$Si(n,$\alpha$), for energy calibration purposes. A comparison of the experiment and the simulation shows that the mean peak energy and full width at half maximum are within 150 keV. The calculated detector efficiency underestimates the experimentally determined efficiency up to 33\%. Discrepancies in the measured energy spectrum indicate the need for a more refined model and experiment control. Overall, the successful validation of the developed Geant4 simulation model against the experimentally measured energy spectra increases confidence in the applicability of such simulation results in other devices. The demonstrated energy calibration highlights new possibilities for neutron spectrometer monitoring during operation at ITER.</description>

      <title>Lamarr: LHCb ultra-fast simulation based on machine learning models deployed within Gauss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: About 90% of the computing resources available to the LHCb experiment has been spent to produce simulated data samples for Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The upgraded LHCb detector will be able to collect larger data samples, requiring many more simulated events to analyze the data to be collected in Run 3. Simulation is a key necessity of analysis to interpret signal, reject background and measure efficiencies. The needed simulation will far exceed the pledged resources, requiring an evolution in technologies and techniques to produce these simulated data samples. In this contribution, we discuss Lamarr, a Gaudi-based framework to speed-up the simulation production parameterizing both the detector response and the reconstruction algorithms of the LHCb experiment. Deep Generative Models powered by several algorithms and strategies are employed to effectively parameterize the high-level response of the single components of the LHCb detector, encoding within neural networks the experimental errors and uncertainties introduced in the detection and reconstruction phases. Where possible, models are trained directly on real data, statistically subtracting any background components by applying appropriate reweighing procedures. Embedding Lamarr in the general LHCb Gauss Simulation framework allows to combine its execution with any of the available generators in a seamless way. The resulting software package enables a simulation process independent of the detailed simulation used to date.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: How to build and control an all-fiber wavefront modulator using mechanical perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimode optical fibers support the dense, low-loss transmission of many spatial modes, making them attractive for technologies such as communications and imaging. However, information propagating through multimode fibers is scrambled, due to modal dispersion and mode mixing. This is usually rectified using wavefront shaping techniques with devices such as spatial light modulators. Recently, we demonstrated an all-fiber system for controlling light propagation inside multimode fibers using mechanical perturbations, called the fiber piano. In this tutorial we explain the design considerations and experimental methods needed to build a fiber piano, and review applications where fiber pianos have been used.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared characterization of NbTiN superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors on silicon-on-insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are widely used for detecting individual photons across various wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Recently, there has been increasing interest in enhancing their sensitivity to single photons in the mid-infrared spectrum, driven by applications in quantum communication, spectroscopy and astrophysics. Here, we present our efforts to expand the spectral detection capabilities of U-shaped NbTiN-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, fabricated in a 2-wire configuration on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, into the mid-infrared range. We demonstrate saturated internal detection efficiency extending up to a wavelength of 3.5 {\mu}m for a 5 nm thick and 50 nm wide NbTiN nanowire with a dark count rate less than 10 counts per second at 0.9 K and a rapid recovery time of 4.3 ns. The detectors are engineered for integration on waveguides in a silicon-on-insulator platform for compact, multi-channel device applications.</description>
