      <title>Interpretable Early Warnings using Machine Learning in an Online Game-experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stemming from physics and later applied to other fields such as ecology, the theory of critical transitions suggests that some regime shifts are preceded by statistical early warning signals. Reddit's r/place experiment, a large-scale social game, provides a unique opportunity to test these signals consistently across thousands of subsystems undergoing critical transitions. In r/place, millions of users collaboratively created compositions, or pixel-art drawings, in which transitions occur when one composition rapidly replaces another. We develop a machine-learning-based early warning system that combines the predictive power of multiple system-specific time series via gradient-boosted decision trees with memory-retaining features. Our method significantly outperforms standard early warning indicators. Trained on the 2022 r/place data, our algorithm detects half of the transitions occurring within 20 minutes at a false positive rate of just 3.7%. Its performance remains robust when tested on the 2023 r/place event, demonstrating generalizability across different contexts. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the predictions, we investigate the underlying drivers of warnings, which could be relevant to other complex systems, especially online social systems. We reveal an interplay of patterns preceding transitions, such as critical slowing down or speeding up, a lack of innovation or coordination, turbulent histories, and a lack of image complexity. These findings show the potential of machine learning indicators in socio-ecological systems for predicting regime shifts and understanding their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Pangraphs as models of higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs depict pairwise relationships between objects within a system. Higher-order interactions (HOIs), which involve more than two objects simultaneously, are common in nature. Such interactions can change the stability of a complex system. Hypergraphs can represent an HOI as an arbitrary subset of vertices. However, they fail to capture the specific roles of the vertices involved, which can be highly asymmetric, particularly in the case of interaction modifications.
  We introduce pangraphs, a robust and quantitative generalisation of graphs that accurately captures arbitrarily complex higher-order interactions. We demonstrate that several higher-order representations proposed in the literature are specific instances of pangraphs. Additionally, we introduce an incidence multilayer digraph representation of a pangraph, referred to as Levi digraph. We adapt degree and Katz centrality measures to the pangraph framework and show that a consistent generalisation of recursive graph measures cannot be simplified to a Levi digraph of a pangraph.
  We construct a pangraph for a real-world coffee agroecosystem and compare Katz centrality between its dihypergraph and pangraph representations, both analytically and numerically. The choice of representation significantly affects centrality values and alters vertex ranks. Additionally, we emphasise the use of real-valued incidence matrices to quantify interaction strengths and the roles of vertices within the system.</description>

      <title>Modeling biases in binary decision-making within the generalized nonlinear q-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary decision frameworks are widely used in the social sciences, including management and economics, to understand collective behavior. In group decision-making, opinions evolve through social influence, shaping outcomes that lead to either consensus or polarization. The $q$ voter model, also known as the non-linear voter model, has been extensively studied in this context. However, the impact of an individual's current opinion on their future stance has been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized model in which an agent's opinion depends not only on its neighbors but also on its own state. As in the original $q$-voter model, a unanimous influence group of size $q$ causes the agent to adopt the group's opinion. However, if the group is not unanimous, the agent will change its opinion with a probability influenced by its current state. This introduces a bias toward a choice that reflects external factors such as politics or advertising. Our model generalizes previous $q$-voter models, including the original one, while allowing for a wider range of scenarios. We analyze the model on a complete graph, deriving the phase diagram and the exit probability for finite systems. We support our analytical approach with Monte Carlo simulations and show that they overlap even for small systems of size $N=64$. Our results show that the exit probability depends on $q$. For $q \geq 3$, the exit probability exhibits a shape that was not observed in previous models, which implies that increasing initial support for a decision does not necessarily change the final collective outcome.</description>

      <title>Complex Network Modelling with Power-law Activating Patterns and Its Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex network theory provides a unifying framework for the study of structured dynamic systems. The current literature emphasizes a widely reported phenomenon of intermittent interaction among network vertices. In this paper, we introduce a complex network model that considers the stochastic switching of individuals between activated and quiescent states at power-law rates and the corresponding evolutionary dynamics. By using the Markov chain and renewal theory, we discover a homogeneous stationary distribution of activated sizes in the network with power-law activating patterns and infer some statistical characteristics. To better understand the effect of power-law activating patterns, we study the two-person-two-strategy evolutionary game dynamics, demonstrate the absorbability of strategies, and obtain the critical cooperation conditions for prisoner's dilemmas in homogeneous networks without mutation. The evolutionary dynamics in real networks are also discussed. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze and understand social physics in time-evolving network systems.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of delay discounting with bi-faceted impulsivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing mathematical models of delay discounting (e. g. exponential model, hyperbolic model, and those derived from nonextensive statistics) consider impulsivity as a single entity. However, the present article derives a novel mathematical model of delay discounting considering impulsivity as a multi-faceted quantity. It involves the bi-faceted characteristic of impulsivity, and considers impulsivity as a variable represented by two positive and fluctuating quantities (e.g. these facets may be trait and state impulsivity). To derive the model, the superstatistics method, which has been used to describe fluctuating physical systems like a thermal plasma, has been adapted. According to the standard practice in behavioural science, we first assume that the total impulsivity is a mere addition of the two facets. However, we also explore the possibility beyond an additive model and conclude that facets of impulsivity may also be combined in a non-additive way. We name this group of models the Extended Effective Exponential Model or $E^3M$. We find a good agreement between our model and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Experiencing Urban Air Mobility: How Passengers evaluate a simulated flight with an Air Taxi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the successful development and implementation of novel concepts and technology, the acceptance of potential users is crucial. Therefore, within the project HorizonUAM of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), we investigated passengers' acceptance of air taxis. One challenge is that not many people have real experiences with urban air mobility (UAM) at the moment and thus requirements formulated by potential users refer to rather abstract concepts. To allow participants to gain realistic impressions of UAM concepts, a Mixed Reality (MR) Air Taxi Simulator was set up. In a study, 30 participants experienced an inner-city business shuttle flight. We assessed the influence of another person on board on wellbeing and information needs in nominal (experiment 1) and non-nominal situations (experiment 2). For the latter, participants experienced a re-routing of the flight due to landing side unavailability. During and after the flights, participants answered questionnaires and extensive interviews were conducted. The study produced empirical data on relevant factors regarding interaction, information needs and comfort within an air taxi. The findings show that passengers want to be informed about intentions of the vehicle. The presence of a flight attendant on board is not necessary but can increase wellbeing especially during non-nominal situations.</description>
