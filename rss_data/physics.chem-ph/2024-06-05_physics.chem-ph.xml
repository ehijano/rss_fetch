      <title>Shape matters: Understanding the effect of electrode geometry on cell resistance and chemo-mechanical stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rechargeable batteries that incorporate shaped three-dimensional electrodes have been shown to have increased power and energy densities for a given footprint area when compared to a conventional geometry, i.e., a planar cathode and anode that sandwich an electrolyte. Electrodes can be shaped to enable a higher loading of active material, while keeping the ion transport distance small, however, the relationship between electrical and mechanical performance remains poorly understood. A variety of electrode shapes have been explored, where the electrodes are individually shaped or intertwined with one another. Advances in manufacturing and shape and topology optimization have made such designs a reality. In this paper, we explore sinusoidal half cells and interdigitated full cells. First, we use a simple electrostatics model to understand the cell resistance as a function of shape. We focus on low-temperature conditions, where the electrolyte conductivity decreases and the governing dimensionless parameters change. Next, we use a chemo-mechanics model to examine the stress concentrations that arise due to intercalation-driven volume expansion. We show that shaped electrodes provide a significant reduction in resistance, however, they result in unfavorable stress concentrations. Overall, we find that the fully interdigitated electrodes may provide the best balance with respect to this trade-off.</description>

      <title>Improved Memory Truncation Scheme for Quasi-Adiabatic Propagator Path Integral via Influence Functional Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics in system-bath coupled problems remains challenging. In this work, we present a novel memory truncation scheme for the iterative Quasi-Adiabatic Propagator Path Integral (iQuAPI) method to improve accuracy. Conventional memory truncation in iQuAPI discards all influence functional beyond a certain time interval, which is not effective for problems with a long memory time. Our proposed scheme selectively retains the most significant parts of the influence functional using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We validate the effectiveness of our scheme through simulations of the spin-boson model across various parameter sets, demonstrating faster convergence and improved accuracy compared to the conventional scheme. Our findings suggest that the new memory truncation scheme significantly advances the capabilities of iQuAPI for problems with a long memory time.</description>

      <title>QCDGE database, Quantum Chemistry Database with Ground- and Excited-state Properties of 450 Kilo Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in deep learning techniques, the demand for large-volume high-quality databases grows significantly in chemical research. We developed a quantum-chemistry database that includes 443,106 small organic molecules with sizes up to 10 heavy atoms including carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and fluorine (F). Ground-state geometry optimizations and frequency calculations of all compounds were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level with the BJD3 dispersion correction, while the excited-state single-point calculations were conducted at the $\omega$B97X-D/6-31G* level. Totally twenty seven molecular properties, such as geometric, thermodynamic, electronic and energetic properties, were gathered from these calculations. Meanwhile, we also established a comprehensive protocol for the construction of a high-volume quantum-chemistry database. Our QCDGE (Quantum Chemistry Database with Ground- and Excited-State Properties) database contains a substantial volume of data, exhibits high chemical diversity, and most importantly includes excited-state information. This database, along with its construction protocol, is expected to have a significant impact on the broad applications of machine learning studies across different fields of chemistry, especially in the area of excited-state research.</description>

      <title>Unitary Dynamics for Open Quantum Systems with Density-Matrix Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of quantum systems interacting with environments requires addressing non-unitary dynamics, which significantly complicates computational approaches. In this work, we enhance an open quantum system (OQS) theory using density-matrix purification, enabling a unitary description of dynamics by entangling the system with an environment of equal dimension. We first establish the connection between density-matrix purification and conventional OQS methods. We then demonstrate the standalone applicability of purification theory by deriving system-environment interactions from fundamental design principles. Using model systems, we show that the purification approach extends beyond the complete positivity condition and effectively models both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, we implement density-matrix purification on a quantum simulator, illustrating its capability to map non-unitary OQS dynamics onto a unitary framework suitable for quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Life beyond Fritz: On the detachment of electrolytic bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on detachment characteristics of hydrogen bubbles during electrolysis. Using a transparent (Pt or Ni) electrode enables us to directly observe the bubble contact line and bubble size. Based on these quantities we determine other parameters such as the contact angle and volume through solutions of the Young-Laplace equation. We observe bubbles without ('pinned bubbles') and with ('spreading bubbles') contact line spreading, and find that the latter mode becomes more prevalent if the concentration of HClO4 is greater than or equal to 0.1 M. The departure radius for spreading bubbles is found to drastically exceed the value predicted by the well-known formula of W. Fritz (Physik. Zeitschr. 1935, 36, 379-384) for this case. We show that this is related to the contact line hysteresis, which leads to pinning of the contact line after an initial spreading phase at the receding contact angle. The departure mode is then similar to a pinned bubble and occurs once the contact angle reaches the advancing contact angle of the surface. A prediction for the departure radius based on these findings is found to be consistent with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>First close-coupling study of the excitation of a large cyclic molecule: collision of c-C5H6 with He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent astronomical observations revealed an increasing molecular complexity in the interstellar medium through the detection of a series of large cyclic carbon species. To correctly interpret these detections, a complex analysis is necessary that takes into account the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions of the emitting media (e.g. when energy level populations deviate from a Boltzman distribution). This requires proper state-to-state collisional data for the excitation and de-excitation processes of the molecular levels. Cyclopentadiene (c-C5H6), which was recently detected in multiple cold interstellar clouds, is extensively studied in many aspects due to its large importance for chemistry in general. At the same time, there are no collisional data available for this species, which are necessary for a more precise interpretation of the corresponding detections. In this work, we first provide an accurate 3D rigid-rotor interaction potential for the [c-C5H6 + He] complex from high-level of ab initio theories, which has been used to study their inelastic collision by the exact close coupling quantum scattering method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where this method is systematically applied to treat the dynamics of molecular collisions involving more than ten atoms. We also analyse the collisional propensity rules and the differences in contrast to calculations, where the approximate coupled states scattering methods is used.</description>

      <title>Timescale bridging in atomistic simulations of epoxy polymer mechanics using non-affine deformation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a deep understanding of macroscopic mechanical properties of amorphous systems which lack structural periodicity, has posed a key challenge, not only at the level of theory but also in molecular simulations. Despite significant advancements in computational resources, there is a vast timescale disparity, more than 6 orders of magnitude, between mechanical properties probed in simulations compared to experiments. Using the theoretical framework of non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD), based on the instantaneous normal modes analysis determined through the dynamical matrix of the system, we study the viscoelastic response of a cross-linked epoxy system of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and poly(oxypropylene) diamine, over many orders of magnitude in deformation frequency, below the glass transition temperature. Predictions of the elastic modulus are satisfactorily validated against the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in the high-frequency regime, and against experimental data from dynamic mechanical analysis at frequencies $ \sim 1 {\rm Hz}$, hence successfully bridging the timescale gap. The comparison shows that non-affine displacements at the atomic level account for nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the low-frequency elastic modulus of the polymer glass, compared to affine elasticity estimates. The analysis also reveals the role of internal stresses (as reflected in the instantaneous normal modes), which act as to strengthen the mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Constraining P and T Violating Forces with Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New sources of parity and time reversal violation are predicted by well motivated extensions of the Standard Model and can be effectively probed by precision spectroscopy of atoms and molecules. Chiral molecules have distinguished enantiomers which are related by parity transformation. Thus, they are promising candidates to search for parity violation at molecular scales, yet to be observed. In this work, we show that precision spectroscopy of the hyperfine structure of chiral molecules is sensitive to new physics sources of parity and time reversal violation. In particular, such a study can be sensitive to regions unexplored by terrestial experiments of a new chiral spin-1 particle that couples to nucleons. We explore the potential to hunt for time reversal violation in chiral molecules and show that it can be a complementary measurement to other probes. We assess the feasibility of such hyperfine metrology and project the sensitivity in CHDBrI$^+$.</description>

      <title>Machine learning Hubbard parameters with equivariant neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT+$U$+$V$) provides a robust framework to accurately describe complex materials containing transition-metal or rare-earth elements. It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly pronounced in systems with partially-filled $d$ and $f$ electronic states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon the accurate determination of the on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently with iterative linear-response calculations, as implemented in density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 11 materials spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3% and 5% for Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters, respectively. By circumventing computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols, our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard parameters with negligible computational overhead, while approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials discovery and design via high-throughput calculations, with relevance for various technological applications.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The evolution of configurations is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunneling Could Enable Proton Transfer Reactions on Titan</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is rich in organics and is often suggested to model early Earth environments. Titan's surface is cold, at a temperature of approximately 90 K, which prohibits most thermally activated chemical reactions. However, quantum effects become more important at low temperatures and reactions that are classically prohibited can often proceed through quantum mechanical pathways. Using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate nuclear quantum effects on the thermodynamics of model proton transfer reactions in liquid ethane. We find that proton transfer can occur at Titan surface conditions through quantum tunneling. Consequently, we estimate that nuclear quantum effects can enhance reaction rates by many orders of magnitude. Our results suggest that nuclear quantum effects could facilitate prebiotic chemistry on Titan, and quantum effects should be considered in future investigations.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Open Quantum Dynamics with Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13233v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of the dynamics of a quantum system coupled to baths are typically performed by utilizing the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel (${\mathcal{K}}$) or the influence functions ($\mathbf{{I}}$), especially when the dynamics exhibit memory effects (i.e., non-Markovian). Despite their significance, the formal connection between the memory kernel and the influence functions has not been explicitly made. We reveal their relation by inspecting the system propagator for a broad class of problems where an $N$-level system is linearly coupled to Gaussian baths (bosonic, fermionic, and spin.) With this connection, we also show how approximate path integral methods can be understood in terms of approximate memory kernels. For a certain class of open quantum system problems, we devised a non-perturbative, diagrammatic approach to construct ${\mathcal{K}}$ from $\mathbf{{I}}$ for (driven) systems interacting with Gaussian baths without the use of any projection-free dynamics inputs required by standard approaches. Lastly, we demonstrate a Hamiltonian learning procedure to extract the bath spectral density from a set of reduced system trajectories obtained experimentally or by numerically exact methods, opening new avenues in quantum sensing and engineering. The insights we provide in this work will significantly advance the understanding of non-Markovian dynamics, and they will be an important stepping stone for theoretical and experimental developments in this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>
