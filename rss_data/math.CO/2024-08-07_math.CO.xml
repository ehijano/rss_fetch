      <title>Symmetrizing polytopes and posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the authors' work on permuto-associahedra, which can be considered as a symmetrization of the associahedron using the symmetric group, we introduce and study the $\mathfrak{G}$-symmetrization of an arbitrary polytope $P$ for any reflection group $\mathfrak{G}$. We show that the combinatorics, and moreover, the normal fan of such a symmetrization can be recovered from its refined fundamental fan, a decorated poset describing how the normal fan of $P$ subdivides the fundamental chamber associated to the reflection group $\mathfrak{G}$.
  One important application of our results is providing a way to approach the realization problem of a $\mathfrak{G}$-symmetric poset F, that is, the problem of constructing a polytope whose face poset is F. Instead of working with the original poset F, we look at its dual poset T (which is $\mathfrak{G}$-symmetric as well) and focus on a generating subposet Z of T, and reduce the problem to realizing Z as a refined fundamental fan.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity and log-convexity via distributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a lemma, which we call the Order Ideal Lemma, that can be used to demonstrate a wide array of log-concavity and log-convexity results in a combinatorial manner using order ideals in distributive lattices. We use the Order Ideal Lemma to prove log-concavity and log-convexity of various sequences involving lattice paths (Catalan, Motzkin and large Schr\"oder numbers), intervals in Young's lattice, order polynomials, specializations of Schur and Schur Q-functions, Lucas sequences, descent and peak polynomials of permutations, pattern avoidance, set partitions, and noncrossing partitions. We end with a section with conjectures and outlining future directions.</description>

      <title>A biased edge coloring game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the \textit{$(m,1)$-edge coloring game}, which is alternatively played by two players Maker and Breaker on a finite simple graph $G$ with a set of colors $X$. Maker plays first and colors $m$ uncolored edges on each turn. Breaker colors only one uncolored edge on each turn. They make sure that adjacent edges get distinct colors. Maker wins if eventually every edge is colored; Breaker wins if at some point, the player who is playing cannot color any edge. We define the \textit{$(m,1)$-game chromatic index} of $G$ to be the smallest positive integer $k$ such that Maker has a winning strategy with $|X|=k$. We determine the exact $(m,1)$-game chromatic indices of some caterpillars and all wheels.</description>

      <title>When do the Kahn-Kalai Bounds Provide New Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Park-Pham theorem (previously known as the Kahn-Kalai conjecture), bounds the critical probability, $p_c(\mathcal{F})$, of the a non-trivial property $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^X$ that is closed under supersets by the product of a universal constant $K$, the expectation threshold of the property, $q(\mathcal{F})$, and the logarithm of the size of the property's largest minimal element, $\log\ell(\mathcal{F})$. That is, the Park-Pham theorem asserts that $p_c(\mathcal{F})\leq Kq(\mathcal{F})\log\ell(\mathcal{F})$. Since the critical probability $p_c(\mathcal{F})$ always satisfies $p_c(\mathcal{F})&lt;1$, one may ask when the upper bound posed by Kahn and Kalai gives us more information than this--that is, when is it true that $Kq(\mathcal{F})\log\ell(\mathcal{F}) &lt; 1$? There are many situations where this occurs, as well as many situations where this is not the case. In this short note, we provide a number of necessary conditions for this to happen together with some easy-to-compute conditions that are sufficient to ensure it.</description>

      <title>Distance ideals of digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on strongly connected, strong for short, digraphs since in this setting distance is defined for every pair of vertices.
  Distance ideals generalize the spectrum and Smith normal form of several distance matrices associated with strong digraphs.
  We introduce the concept of pattern which allow us to characterize the family $\Gamma_1$ of digraphs with only one trivial distance ideal over ${\mathbb Z}$.
  This result generalizes an analogous result for undirected graphs that states that connected graphs with one trivial ideal over $\mathbb{Z}$ consists of either complete graphs or complete bipartite graphs.
  It turns out that the strong digraphs in $\Gamma_1$ consists in the circuit with 3 vertices and a family $\Lambda$ of strong digraphs that contains complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs, regarded as digraphs. We also compute all distance ideals of some strong digraphs in the family $\Lambda$.
  Then, we explore circuits, which turn out to be an infinite family of minimal forbidden digraphs, as induced subdigraphs, for the strong digraphs in $\Gamma_1$.
  This suggests that a characterization of $\Gamma_1$ in terms of forbidden induced subdigraphs is harder than using patterns.</description>

      <title>Wythoff's Nim with Finite Alterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wythoff's Nim is a variant of 2-pile Nim in which players are allowed to take any positive number of stones from pile 1, or any positive number of stones from pile 2, or the same positive number from both piles. The player who makes the last move wins. It is well-known that the P-positions (losing positions) are precisely those where the two piles have sizes $\{\lfloor \phi n \rfloor, \lfloor \phi^2n \rfloor \}$ for some integer $n\geq 0$, and $\phi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2 = 1.6180\cdots$.
  In this paper we consider an altered form of Wythoff's Nim where an arbitrary finite set of positions are designated to be P or N positions. The values of the remaining positions are computed in the normal fashion for the game. We prove that the set of P-positions of the altered game closely resembles that of a translated normal Wythoff game. In fact the fraction of overlap of the sets of P-positions of these two games approaches $1$ as the pile sizes being considered go to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly distance-regular digraphs are a natural directed version of distance-regular graphs. In [16], we classified all commutative weakly distance-regular digraphs whose underlying graphs are Hamming graphs, folded n-cubes, or Doob graphs. In this paper, we classify all commutative weakly distance-regular digraphs whose underlying graphs are Johnson graphs or folded Johnson graphs.</description>

Abstract: Tiered trees were introduced as a combinatorial object for counting absolutely indecomposable representation of certain quivers and torus orbit of certain homogeneous variety. In this paper, we define a bijection between the set of parallelogram polyominoes and graphical parking functions. Moreover, we defined the space $\mathcal{S}_{G}$ for complete tiered graphs and described tiered graphs in terms of Whitney's operations.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Extensions of Spectral Tur\'an Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral Tur\'an theorem states that the $k$-partite Tur\'an graph is the unique graph attaining the maximum adjacency spectral radius among all graphs of order $n$ containing no the complete graph $K_{k+1}$ as a subgraph. This result is known to be stronger than the classical Tur\'an theorem. In this paper, we consider hypergraph extensions of spectral Tur\'an theorem. For $k\geq r\geq 2$, let $H_{k+1}^{(r)}$ be the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $K_{k+1}$ by enlarging each edge with a new set of $(r-2)$ vertices. Let $F_{k+1}^{(r)}$ be the $r$-uniform hypergraph with edges: $\{1,2,\ldots,r\} =: [r]$ and $E_{ij} \cup\{i,j\}$ over all pairs $\{i,j\}\in \binom{[k+1]}{2}\setminus\binom{[r]}{2}$, where $E_{ij}$ are pairwise disjoint $(r-2)$-sets disjoint from $[k+1]$. Generalizing the Tur\'an theorem to hypergraphs, Pikhurko [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 103 (2013) 220--225] and Mubayi and Pikhurko [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 97 (2007) 669--678] respectively determined the exact Tur\'an number of $H_{k+1}^{(r)}$ and $F_{k+1}^{(r)}$, and characterized the corresponding extremal hypergraphs.
  Our main results show that $T_r(n,k)$, the complete $k$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices where no two parts differ by more than one in size, is the unique hypergraph having the maximum $p$-spectral radius among all $n$-vertex $H_{k+1}^{(r)}$-free (resp. $F_{k+1}^{(r)}$-free) $r$-uniform hypergraphs for sufficiently large $n$. These findings are obtained by establishing $p$-spectral version of the stability theorems. Our results offer $p$-spectral analogues of the results by Mubayi and Pikhurko, and connect both hypergraph Tur\'an theorem and hypergraph spectral Tur\'an theorem in a unified form via the $p$-spectral radius.</description>

      <title>Coloring the vertices of a graph with mutual-visibility property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a mutual-visibility coloring of $G$ is introduced as follows. We color two vertices $x,y\in V(G)$ with a same color, if there is a shortest $x,y$-path whose internal vertices have different colors than $x,y$. The smallest number of colors needed in a mutual-visibility coloring of $G$ is the mutual-visibility chromatic number of $G$, which is denoted $\chi_{\mu}(G)$. Relationships between $\chi_{\mu}(G)$ and its two parent ones, the chromatic number and the mutual-visibility number, are presented. Graphs of diameter two are considered, and in particular the asymptotic growth of the mutual-visibility number of the Cartesian product of complete graphs is determined. A greedy algorithm that finds a mutual-visibility coloring is designed and several possible scenarios on its efficiency are discussed. Several bounds are given in terms of other graph parameters such as the diameter, the order, the maximum degree, the degree of regularity of regular graphs, and/or the mutual-visibility number. For the corona products it is proved that the value of its mutual-visibility chromatic number depends on that of the first factor of the product. Graphs $G$ for which $\chi_{\mu}(G)=2$ are also considered.</description>

      <title>Generalized dessin partition function, cut-and-join type representation, and polynomiality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the enumeration problem of a special kind of branched coverings of the Riemann sphere, whose partition function can be regarded as a generalization of the dessin partition function. First we derive a cut-and-join type representation for the generalized dessin partition function using the actions of $W$-type operators on Schur functions. Then we study the polynomial structures of the generalized dessin partition function. We prove a polynomial structure for the disconnected correlators which generalizes a result of Stanley, and then propose a conjectural polynomial structure for the connected correlators. We prove the $1$-point case of this conjecture using the KP integrability of this partition function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the determinant of the bilinear form in middle degree of the generic artinian reduction of the Stanley-Reisner ring of an odd-dimensional simplicial sphere. This proves the odd multiplicity conjecture of Papadakis and Petrotou and implies that this determinant is a complete invariant of the simplicial sphere. We extend this result to odd-dimensional connected oriented simplicial homology manifolds, and we conjecture a generalization to the Hodge-Riemann forms of any connected oriented simplicial homology manifold. We show that our conjecture follows from the strong Lefschetz property for certain quotients of the Stanley-Reisner rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to advance the development of a fractal theory for sets of integers. The core idea is to utilize the fractal structure of $p$-adic integers, where $p$ is a prime number, and compare this with conventional densities and counting measures for integers. Our approach yields some results in combinatorial number theory. The results show how the local fractal structure of a set in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ can provide bounds for the counting measure for its projection onto $\mathbb{Z}$. Additionally, we establish a relationship between the counting dimension of a set of integers and its box-counting dimension in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Since our results pertain to sets that are projections of closed sets in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, we also provide both necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for a set $E\subset \mathbb{Z}$ to be the projection of a closed set in $\mathbb{Z}_p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a direct combinatorial proof of a Feynman graph identity which implies a wide generalization of a formality theorem by Kontsevich. For a Feynman graph $\Gamma$, we associate to each vertex a position $x_v \in \mathbb R$ and to each edge $e$ the combination $s_e = a_e^{-\frac 12} \left( x^+_e - x^-_e \right)$, where $x^\pm_e$ are the positions of the two end vertices of $e$ and $a_e$ a Schwinger parameter. The $``$topological propagator$"$ $P_e = e^{-s_e^2}$d$s_e$ includes a part proportional to d$x_v$ and a part proportional to d$a_e$. Integrating the product of all $P_e$ over positions produces a differential form $\alpha_\Gamma$ in the variables $a_e$. We prove that $\alpha_\Gamma \wedge \alpha_\Gamma=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15326v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of fairly dividing a divisible heterogeneous resource, also known as a cake, among a set of agents who may have different entitlements. We characterize the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation -- one in which every agent receives a contiguous piece worth strictly more than their proportional share. The characterization is supplemented with an algorithm that determines its existence using O(n * 2^n) queries. We devise a simpler characterization for agents with strictly positive valuations and with equal entitlements, and present an algorithm to determine the existence of such an allocation using O(n^2) queries. We provide matching lower bounds in the number of queries for both algorithms. When a connected strongly-proportional allocation exists, we show that it can also be computed using a similar number of queries. We also consider the problem of deciding the existence of a connected allocation of a cake in which each agent receives a piece worth a small fixed value more than their proportional share, and the problem of deciding the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation of a pie.</description>

Abstract: A modification of Merino-Mi\v{c}ka-M\"utze's solution to a combinatorial generation problem of Knuth is proposed in this survey. The resulting alternate form to such solution is compatible with a reinterpretation by the author of a proof of existence of Hamilton cycles in the middle-levels graphs. Such reinterpretation is given in terms of a dihedral quotient graph associated to each middle-levels graph. The vertices of such quotient graph represent Dyck words and their associated ordered trees. Those Dyck words are linearly ordered via a rooted tree that covers all their tight, or irreducible, forms, offering an universal reference point of view to express and integrate the periodic paths, or blocks, whose concatenation leads to Hamilton cycles resulting from the said solution.</description>

      <title>A note on the threshold numbers of cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to be a \textit{$k$-threshold graph} with \textit{thresholds} $\theta_1&lt;\theta_2&lt;...&lt;\theta_k$ if there is a map $r: V \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $uv\in E$ if and only if $\theta_i\le r(u)+r(v)$ holds for an odd number of $i\in [k]$. The \textit{threshold number} of $G$, denoted by $\Theta(G)$, is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $G$ is a $k$-threshold graph. In this paper, we determine the exact threshold numbers of cycles by proving
  \[ \Theta(C_n)=\begin{cases}
  1 &amp; if\ n=3,
  2 &amp; if\ n=4,
  4 &amp; if\ n\ge 5,
  \end{cases}
  \]
  where $C_n$ is the cycle with $n$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Some Property of an Ultrafilter and Graph parameters on Connectivity System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ultrafilter is a maximal filter on a set, playing a crucial role in set theory and topology for rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X, f), where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters helps to elucidate the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.03556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if an $n$-dimensional space $X$ satisfies certain topological conditions then any triangulation of $X$ as well as any its representation as a simplicial set with contractible faces has at least $2^n$ faces of dimension $n$.
  One example of such $X$ is the $n$-dimensional torus $(S^1)^n$.</description>

      <title>PolarStar: Expanding the Scalability Horizon of Diameter-3 Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PolarStar, a novel family of diameter-3 network topologies derived from the star product of low-diameter factor graphs. PolarStar gives the largest known diameter-3 network topologies for almost all radixes, thus providing the best known scalable diameter-$3$ network. Compared to current state-of-the-art diameter-$3$ networks, PolarStar achieves $1.3\times$ geometric mean increase in scale over Bundlefly, $1.9\times$ over Dragonfly, and $6.7\times$ over {3-D} HyperX. PolarStar has many other desirable properties, including a modular layout, large bisection, high resilience to link failures and a large number of feasible configurations for every radix. We give a detailed evaluation with simulations of synthetic and real-world traffic patterns and show that PolarStar exhibits comparable or better performance than current diameter-3 networks.</description>

      <title>Fast Mixing in Sparse Random Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the community detection problem in Bayesian inference, as well as the recent explosion of interest in spin glasses from statistical physics, we study the classical Glauber dynamics for sampling from Ising models with sparse random interactions. It is now well-known that when the interaction matrix has spectral diameter less than $1$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $O(n\log n)$ steps. Unfortunately, such criteria fail dramatically for interactions supported on arguably the most well-studied sparse random graph: the Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,d/n)$, due to the presence of almost linearly many outlier eigenvalues of unbounded magnitude.
  We prove that for the \emph{Viana--Bray spin glass}, where the interactions are supported on $G(n,d/n)$ and randomly assigned $\pm\beta$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time with high probability as long as $\beta \le O(1/\sqrt{d})$, independent of $n$. We further extend our results to random graphs drawn according to the $2$-community stochastic block model, as well as when the interactions are given by a "centered" version of the adjacency matrix. The latter setting is particularly relevant for the inference problem in community detection. Indeed, we use this to show that Glauber dynamics succeeds at recovering communities in the stochastic block model in a companion paper [LMR+24].
  The primary technical ingredient in our proof is showing that with high probability, a sparse random graph can be decomposed into two parts -- a \emph{bulk} which behaves like a graph with bounded maximum degree and a well-behaved spectrum, and a \emph{near-forest} with favorable pseudorandom properties. We then use this decomposition to design a localization procedure that interpolates to simpler Ising models supported only on the near-forest, and then execute a pathwise analysis to establish a modified log-Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <title>On shortest products for nonnegative matrix mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of matrices with integer entries, the matrix mortality problem asks if there exists a product of these matrices equal to the zero matrix. We consider a special case of this problem where all entries of the matrices are nonnegative. This case is equivalent to the NFA mortality problem, which, given an NFA, asks for a word $w$ such that the image of every state under $w$ is the empty set. The size of the alphabet of the NFA is then equal to the number of matrices in the set. We study the length of shortest such words depending on the size of the alphabet. We show that for an NFA with $n$ states this length can be at least $2^n - 1$ for an alphabet of size $n$, $2^{(n - 4)/2}$ for an alphabet of size $3$ and $2^{(n - 2)/3}$ for an alphabet of size $2$. We also discuss further open problems related to mortality of NFAs and DFAs.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of theta functions as Traces of Partition Eisenstein series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his "lost notebook'', Ramanujan used iterated derivatives of two theta functions to define sequences of $q$-series $\{U_{2t}(q)\}$ and $\{V_{2t}(q)\}$ that he claimed to be quasimodular. We give the first explicit proof of this claim by expressing them in terms of "partition Eisenstein series'', extensions of the classical Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(q)$ defined by $$\lambda=(1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2},\dots, n^{m_n}) \vdash n \ \ \ \ \ \longmapsto \ \ \ \ \ E_{\lambda}(q):= E_2(q)^{m_1} E_4(q)^{m_2}\cdots E_{2n}(q)^{m_n}. $$ For functions $\phi : \mathcal{P}\mapsto \mathbb{C}$ on partitions, the weight $2n$ partition Eisenstein trace is $$ \text{Tr}_n(\phi;q):=\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \phi(\lambda)E_{\lambda}(q). $$ For all $t$, we prove that $U_{2t}(q)=\text{Tr}_t(\phi_U;q)$ and $V_{2t}(q)=\text{Tr}_t(\phi_V;q),$ where $\phi_U$ and $\phi_V$ are natural partition weights, giving the first explicit quasimodular formulas for these series.</description>
