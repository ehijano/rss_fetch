      <title>Photoluminescence from metal nanostructures -- dependence on size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, there have been multiple seemingly contradicting experimental reports on the dependence of the photoluminescence from metal nanostructures on their size. We reconcile these reports using a simple analytic formula which is found to match well photoluminescence measurements for a range of structures and illumination conditions. Our expression requires only knowledge of the local electric field and temperature, and it points to the physical quantities that determine the emission strength and its dependence on size.</description>

      <title>Parity Metamaterials and Dynamic Acoustic Mimicry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While parity transformation represents a fundamental symmetry operation in physics, its implications remain underexplored in metamaterial science. Here, we introduce a framework leveraging parity transformation to construct parity-inverted counterparts of arbitrary three-dimensional meta-atoms, enabling the creation of parity-engineered metamaterial slabs. We demonstrate that the synergy between reciprocity and parity transformation, distinct from mirror operation, guarantees undistorted wave transmission across exceptional bandwidths, independent of structural configuration or meta-atom design specifics. Furthermore, these metamaterials exhibit dynamic acoustic mimicry capability, enabling adaptive blending of reflected signatures into surrounding environments while preserving transmitted wavefront integrity. Validated through numerical simulations and experimental prototypes, this breakthrough offers transformative potential for acoustic camouflage applications, particularly for sonar systems. Our findings reveal fundamental implications of parity transformation in artificial materials, establishing parity engineering as a paradigm for designing ultra-broadband functional materials with unprecedented operational versatility.</description>

      <title>3D variational autoencoder for fingerprinting microstructure volume elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Transition Metal Ion Transport in High-Gradient Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic separation has emerged as an eco-friendly and sustainable technique with applications in water purification, chemical separation, biochemical, medical, and mining. In this study, we present, a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the transport of transition metal ions using high-gradient magnetic fields. Experiments were conducted on aqueous solutions containing either paramagnetic manganese chloride (MnCl$_$2) or diamagnetic zinc chloride (ZnCl$_$2) ions, with concentrations ranging from 1 mM to 100 mM under a non-uniform magnetic field of an electromagnet. Our results demonstrate that while paramagnetic MnCl$_$2 is captured by the mesh wool in the magnetic field, diamagnetic ZnCl$_$2 remains unaffected by the presence of magnetic field. The capture efficiency of paramagnetic MnCl$_$2 increases with both the initial ion concentration and the applied magnetic field strength. Furthermore, in binary mixtures, the capture rate of MnCl2 is reduced compared to single-ion solutions, highlighting the role of ion interactions in magnetic separation. Our theoretical modeling indicates that magnetic capture is governed by a balance between magnetic forces and viscous forces. Additionally, the magnetic separation process is enhanced by the field-induced cluster formation of paramagnetic metal ions, which are predicted to be two orders of magnitude larger than individual hydrated ion units. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of magnetic transport of metal ions and offer potential pathways for improving separation efficiency in complex ion mixtures that contain critical materials.</description>

      <title>Random batch list method for metallic system with embedded atom potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The embedded atom method (EAM) is one of the most widely used many-body, short-range potentials in molecular dynamics simulations, particularly for metallic systems. To enhance the efficiency of calculating these short-range interactions, we extend the random batch list (RBL) concept to the EAM potential, resulting in the RBL-EAM algorithm. The newly presented method introduces two "core-shell" lists for approximately computing the host electron densities and the force terms, respectively. Direct interactions are computed in the core regions, while in the shell zones a random batch list is used to reduce the number of interaction pairs, leading to significant reductions in both computational complexity and storage requirements. We provide a theoretical, unbiased estimate of the host electron densities and the force terms. Since metallic systems are Newton-pair systems, we extend the RBL-EAM algorithm to exploit this property, thereby halving the computational cost. Numerical examples, including the lattice constant, the radial distribution function, and the elastic constants, demonstrate that the RBL-EAM method significantly accelerates simulations several times without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Stereological 3D modeling of nano-scale catalyst particles using TEM projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catalysis, particularly heterogeneous catalysis, is crucial in the chemical industry and energy storage. Approximately 80% of all chemical products produced by heterogeneous catalysis are produced by solid catalysts, which are essential for the synthesizing of ammonia, methanol, and hydrocarbons. Despite extensive use, challenges in catalyst development remain, including enhancing selectivity, stability, and activity. These effective properties are influenced by the nanoscale morphology of the catalysts, whereby the size of the nanoparticles is only one key descriptor. To investigate the relationship between nanoparticle morphology and catalytic performance, a comprehensive 3D analysis of nano-scale catalyst particles is necessary. However, traditional imaging techniques for a representative recording of this size range, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are mostly limited to 2D. Thus, in the present paper, a stochastic 3D model is developed for a data-driven analysis of the nanostructure of catalyst particles. The calibration of this model is achieved using 2D TEM data from two different length scales, allowing for a statistically representative 3D modeling of catalyst particles. Furthermore, digital twins of catalyst particles can be drawn for the stochastic 3D model for virtual materials testing, enhancing the understanding of the relationship between catalyst nanostructure and performance.</description>

      <title>Selective Oxidation and Cr Segregation in High-Entropy Oxide Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy oxides (HEOs) offer exceptional compositional flexibility and structural stability, making them promising materials for energy and catalytic applications. Here, we investigate Sr doping effects on B-site cation oxidation states, local composition, and structure in epitaxial La1-xSrx(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 thin films. X-ray spectroscopies reveal that Sr doping preferentially promotes Cr oxidation from Cr3+ to Cr6+, partially oxidizes Co and Ni, while leaving Mn4+ and Fe3+ unchanged. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows pronounced Cr segregation, with Cr exhibiting depletion at the film-substrate interface and enrichment at the film surface, along with the formation of a partially amorphous phase in heavily Sr-doped samples. This segregation is likely driven by oxidation-induced migration of smaller, high-valence Cr cations during the growth. These findings underscore the critical interplay between charge transfer, local strain, and compositional fluctuations, providing strategies to control surface composition and electronic structure in HEOs for more robust electrocatalyst design.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Model of Solution and Stoichiometric Phases with Molar Volume Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-field models have proven indispensable for deciphering the microstructure complexities inherent in multicomponent systems. The confluence of varying phase molar volumes presents unique challenges. Understanding the impact of molar volume differences on multiphase systems is of crucial significance, as it directly influences the system's thermodynamic and kinetic behavior, as well as resulting phase morphologies and distributions. In this study, we developed a phase-field model of solution and stoichiometric phases that can account for the molar volume differences. With the phase molar volumes taken from existing CALPHAD thermodynamic databases, we quantitatively investigated how the different molar volume settings would influence the growth rate and morphologies of stoichiometric $\theta^\prime$-\ce{Al2Cu} and $\beta$-\ce{Al140Mg89} precipitates in Al-based alloys. We anticipate that this approach can be applied to various materials systems with phase- and composition-dependent molar volumes for more accurate phase-field predictions.</description>

      <title>Spall failure of alumina at high-strain rates using femtosecond laser experiments and high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ceramic materials are widely used in high-strain-rate applications due to their exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. However, under these extreme conditions, spall failure becomes a critical concern, which is driven by a large hydrostatic tensile stress state. This study introduces a novel two-laser setup to generate controlled hydrostatic stress states at specific locations within test specimens. By inducing and manipulating shock wave interactions, we achieve large hydrostatic compressive and tensile stresses at very high-strain-rates, enabling the controlled nucleation and growth of nanovoids leading to spall failure. Our experiments demonstrate that shock wave interference can precisely trigger spallation at arbitrary locations in the specimen thickness. To further validate our approach, we investigate alumina spall failure using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a custom-designed graph neural network potential. The MD results show strong agreement with experimentally estimated spall strength. These findings highlight the potential of the two-laser technique as a powerful tool for studying the early stages of spall failure in ceramics, paving the way for advanced materials testing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Long-range magnetic perturbations at Bi2Te3/Cr2Te3 interfaces induced by chemical diffusion and proximity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heterointerface between topological insulators and magnetic materials provides a crucial platform for investigating exotic electronic and magnetic phases, with implications for both fundamental studies and potential applications. A key challenge is determining the spatial extent of magnetic perturbation across the interface. In this study, we grew Bi2Te3 films with mixed thicknesses of 5 and 6 quintuple layers (QLs) on a thick ferromagnetic Cr2Te3 film. Chemical analysis indicates gradual Cr diffusion across the interface into Bi2Te3, reaching up to the 4th QL, while the 5th and 6th QL remain free of Cr. Despite the absence of direct Cr incorporation, quasiparticle interference imaging using spectroscopic scanning tunneling microscopy reveals strong backscattering on the 5th QL surface. This suggests an intrinsic magnetic proximity effect, which breaks time-reversal symmetry without magnetic doping, extending into the 5th QLs. Although variations may exist across different systems, the large magnetic perturbation length scale observed here is a valuable guiding principle for engineering exotic electronic and magnetic states at heterointerfaces between topological insulators and magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of noncentrosymmetric structural distortion in altermagnetic MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hexagonal MnTe is a prime material candidate for altermagnets, an emerging class of magnetic compounds characterized by the nontrivial interplay of antiparallel spin arrangements with their underlying crystal structures. Recognizing precise knowledge of crystal symmetry as the cornerstone of the spin-group classification scheme, we report here a native inversion-symmetry-breaking structural distortion in this compound that has previously been overlooked. Through optical polarimetry experiments and first-principle calculations, we show that MnTe belongs to the noncentrosymmetric $D_{3h}$ group, effectively resolving key inconsistencies in the earlier interpretations of Raman spectroscopy data. Our finding impacts the symmetry analysis of MnTe within the altermagnetic class and sheds light on the mechanism of its magneto-controllable N\'eel order.</description>

      <title>Accelerating and enhancing thermodynamic simulations of electrochemical interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical interfaces are crucial in catalysis, energy storage, and corrosion, where their stability and reactivity depend on complex interactions between the electrode, adsorbates, and electrolyte. Predicting stable surface structures remains challenging, as traditional surface Pourbaix diagrams tend to either rely on expert knowledge or costly $\textit{ab initio}$ sampling, and neglect thermodynamic equilibration with the environment. Machine learning (ML) potentials can accelerate static modeling but often overlook dynamic surface transformations. Here, we extend the Virtual Surface Site Relaxation-Monte Carlo (VSSR-MC) method to autonomously sample surface reconstructions modeled under aqueous electrochemical conditions. Through fine-tuning foundational ML force fields, we accurately and efficiently predict surface energetics, recovering known Pt(111) phases and revealing new LaMnO$_\mathrm{3}$(001) surface reconstructions. By explicitly accounting for bulk-electrolyte equilibria, our framework enhances electrochemical stability predictions, offering a scalable approach to understanding and designing materials for electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Dependent \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diode with Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) Grown NiO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the demonstration of ALD-deposited NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs) on low doped drift layer and highly doped (001) &amp; (100) n+ substrates with experimental observation of a parallel-plane junction electric field as high as 7.5 MV/cm, revealing a crystal orientation dependence in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. We use a novel metalorganic precursor bis(1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,3-diazadienyl) (nickel Ni(tBu2DAD)2) with ozone (O3) to deposit NiO. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD on 7.7 {\mu}m-thick HVPE-grown drift region exhibited an on-state current density of ~20 A/cm2 at 5 V, ~10-8 A/cm2 reverse leakage at low reverse bias(-5 V), and a rectifying ratio(Jon/Joff) of ~109. The HJD broke down at ~2.2 kV reverse bias, corresponding to a ~3.4 MV/cm parallel-plane junction electric field, with a noise floor reverse leakage (10-8~10-6 A/cm2, nA) at 80% of the device catastrophic breakdown voltage. The NiO/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs on n+ (001) &amp; (100) highly-doped substrates exhibited breakdown voltages at 12.5-16.0 V and 28.5-70.5 V, respectively, with extracted critical electric field (EC) at 2.30-2.76 MV/cm, and 4.33-7.50 MV/cm, revealing a substrate crystal orientation dependence on breakdown electric field for \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The 7.5 MV/cm EC reported here is one of the highest parallel-plane junction electric fields reported in literature.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing \textit{ab initio} calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a small equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirming the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Assisted Denoising of Experimental Micrographs</title>

Abstract: Microstructure imaging is crucial in materials science, but experimental images often introduce noise that obscures critical structural details. This study presents a novel deep learning approach for robust microstructure image denoising, combining phase-field simulations, Fourier transform techniques, and an attention-based neural network. The innovative framework addresses dataset limitations by synthetically generating training data by combining computational phase-field microstructures with experimental optical micrographs. The neural network architecture features an attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on important microstructural features while systematically eliminating noise types like scratches and surface imperfections. Testing on a FeMnNi alloy system demonstrated the model's exceptional performance across multiple magnifications. By successfully removing diverse noise patterns while maintaining grain boundary integrity, the research provides a generalizable deep-learning framework for microstructure image enhancement with broad applicability in materials science.</description>

      <title>Designer three-dimensional electronic bands in asymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals materials enable the construction of atomically sharp interfaces between compounds with distinct crystal and electronic properties. This is dramatically exploited in moir\'e systems, where a lattice mismatch or twist between monolayers generates an emergent in-plane periodicity, giving rise to electronic properties absent in the constituent materials. In contrast, vertical superlattices-formed by stacking dissimilar van der Waals materials in the out-of-plane direction on the nanometer scale-remain largely unexplored, despite their potential to realize analogous emergent phenomena in three dimensions. Here, we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory to investigate six-to-eight layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. We find that even a single superlattice unit, i.e. a pair of stacked few-layer materials, exhibits emergent bands that closely resemble the hallmark three-dimensional electronic structure of many-layer TMDs, while simultaneously exhibiting an orbital- and momentum-dependent delocalization through the entire heterostructure due to its asymmetric architecture. We demonstrate how non-trivial band topology and unique TMD fermiologies are readily stabilized through these mechanisms, thus providing direct evidence for the novel electronic states possible through vertical superlattice engineering. These findings establish asymmetric heterostructures as platforms to invoke and control unprecedented combinations of the diverse quantum phases native to many-layer TMDs.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Electrically Switchable Nonvolatile Thermal Transistor with Multiple Thermal Conductivity States Based on Ferroelectric HfO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While nanoscale electronic logic circuits are well-established, the development of na-noscale thermal logic circuits has been slow, mainly due to the absence of efficient and controllable nonvolatile field-effect thermal transistors. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that leverages ferroelectric orthorhombic hafnium dioxide (o-HfO2) thin films to achieve electrically switchable nonvolatile field-effect thermal transistors. Using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning potentials, we demonstrate that a 24 nm o-HfO2 film can exhibit four distinct, reversible states of thermal conductivity. Notably, these states achieve a maximum switching ratio of 171% under 2% tensile strain. Our results underscore the potential of ferroelectric materials, particularly o-HfO2, in advancing thermal logic circuits by enabling multiple, stable thermal conductivity states controlled by electric fields.</description>

      <title>Predicting Mode-I/II fracture toughness and crack growth in diboride ceramics via machine-learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fracture toughness and strength are critical for structural ceramics, which are prone to brittle failure. However, accurately characterizing these properties is challenging, especially for thin films on substrates. In-situ microscopy often fails to resolve crack initiation, while fractured samples provide limited insight into fracture modes and crack paths. Here, we employ stress intensity factor ($K$) controlled atomistic simulations of fracture to characterize the crack-initiation properties of hard but brittle diboride ceramics. Our molecular statics calculations are based on moment-tensor machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained on {\it{ab initio}} information collected for a variety of atomistic environments. TMB$_{2}$ (TM$=$Ti, Zr, Hf) lattice models with six distinct atomically-sharp crack geometries subjected to Mode-I (opening) and/or Mode-II (sliding) deformation serve as platforms to illustrate the capability of the approach. The Mode-I initiation toughness $K_{Ic}$ and fracture strength $\sigma_{f}$ -- within ranges 1.8-2.9~MPa$\cdot\sqrt{m}$ and 1.6-2.4~GPa -- are extrapolated at the macroscale limit by fitting the results of finite (up to 10$^{6}$ atoms) cracked plate models with constitutive scaling relations. Our simulations show that most diboride lattice models fail by extension of the native crack. However, crack-deflection on the $(1\overline{1}01)$ plane is observed for the $(10\overline{1}0)[\overline{1}2\overline{1}0]$ crystal geometry. As exemplified by TiB$_{2}$, varying Mode-I/II loading ratios have little influence on crack propagation paths, which overall occurs by decohesion of low-energy fracture planes or combined sliding. Our predictions are supported by cube-corner nanoindentation on TiB$_{2}$ samples along the [0001] direction, revealing the same fracture plane as observed in simulations.</description>

      <title>Review of the Electrochemical Double Layer Theory and Its Applications in Battery Electrode Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interface plays a critical role in electrochemical systems, driving the development of various theories to investigate properties at nanoscale and microscale levels, including the electrictrochemical double layer (EDL) theory and continuum theory. However, the application of EDL theory within the realm of battery electrode materials has not been clearly defined according to material type. The diverse range of materials and their intricate interactions with interface theories often lead to misunderstandings. This review meticulously outlines the origins and principles of the EDL theory. Additionally, it categorizes battery electrode materials into two main groups: semiconductors and conductors. A comprehensive examination is presented on the implementation of EDL and other interface theories, accompanied by a comparative evaluation of the fundamental models and experiments described. The review also explores the potential advancements of EDL and other interface theories, as well as their application in electrode materials. This exhaustive review serves as an invaluable resource for scholars in electrochemistry and materials science, aiding in their understanding of interface theories, their scope of applicability, and the integration of these theories with practical experimental approaches.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Phonon Calculations in Molecular Crystals via Minimal Molecular Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational dynamics governs the fundamental properties of molecular crystals, shaping their thermodynamics, mechanics, spectroscopy, and transport phenomena. However desirable, the first-principles calculation of solid-state vibrations, i.e.\ phonons, stands as a major computational challenge in molecular crystals characterized by many atoms in the unit cell and by weak intermolecular interactions. Here we propose a formulation of the harmonic lattice dynamics based on a natural basis of molecular coordinates consisting of rigid-body displacements and intramolecular vibrations. This enables a sensible \emph{minimal molecular displacement} approximation for the calculation of the dynamical matrix, combining isolated molecule calculations with only a small number of expensive crystal supercell calculations, ultimately reducing the computational cost by up to a factor 10. The comparison with reference calculations demonstrates the quantitative accuracy of our method, especially for the challenging and dispersive low-frequency region it is designed for. Our method provides an excellent description of the thermodynamic properties and offers a privileged molecular-level insight into the complex phonons band structure of molecular materials.</description>

      <title>Electric fields-tuning plasmon and coupled plasmon-phonon modes in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the electric field-tuning plasmons and plasmon-phonon couplings of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as monolayer MoS2, under the consideration of spin-orbit coupling. It is revealed that the frequencies of plasmons and coupled plasmon-phonon modes originating from electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions can be effectively changed by using applied driving electric fields. Notably, these frequencies exhibit a decreasing trend with an increasing electric field. Moreover, the weak angular dependence of these modes suggests that the driving electric field does not induce significant anisotropy in the plasmon modes. The outcomes of this work demonstrate that the plasmon and coupled plasmon-phonon modes can be tuned not only by manipulating the electron density via the application of a gate voltage but also by tuning the applied driving electric field. These findings hold relevance for facilitating the application of 2D TMDs in optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Computing ternary liquid phase diagrams: Fe-Cu-Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the phase separation of the immiscible liquid alloy Fe-Cu-Ni. Our computational approach uses a virtual semigrand canonical Widom approach to determine differences in excess chemical potentials between different species. Using an embedded atom potential for Fe-Cu-Ni, we simulate liquid states over a range of compositions and temperatures. This raw data is then fit to Redlich-Kister polynomials for the Gibbs free energy with a simple temperature dependence. Using the analytic form, we can determine the phase diagram for the ternary liquid, compute the miscibility gap and spinodal decomposition as a function of temperature for this EAM potential. In addition, we compute density as a function of composition and temperature, and predict pair correlation functions. We use static structure factors to estimate the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy (the $S^0$ method) and compare with our fit Gibbs free energy. Finally, using a nonequilibrium Hamiltonian integration method, we separately compute absolute Gibbs free energies for the pure liquid states; this shows that our endpoints are accurate to within 1 meV for our ternary Gibbs free energy, as well as the absolute Gibbs free energy for the ternary liquid.</description>

      <title>Possible high thermoelectric power factor in alkali-metal-intercalated BC$_3$: anisotropic multiple valleys originating from the van Hove singularity of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the electronic structure of monolayer BC$_3$ and find that monolayer BC$_3$ hosts anisotropic multiple valleys originating from the splitting of the van Hove singularity in graphene. This splitting is caused by the inequivalency between boron and carbon atoms. To make use of the favorable electronic structure, we investigate the electronic structure of alkali-metal-intercalated BC$_3$, where intercalated atoms not only introduce the electron carriers but also suppress the interlayer coupling. We find that the interlayer transfer is effectively suppressed by potassium intercalation, by which the favorable electronic structure of monolayer BC$_3$ is kept. Finally, we perform model calculation with the onsite-energy offset, and verified that the strategy, introducing the splitting to the van Hove singularity, works well in general situations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Coverage Dependent Interactions of N-Methylaniline with the Pt(111) Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to elucidate the adsorption and surface chemistry of N-methylaniline (NMA) on Pt(111), using it as a model molecule to probe the activation mechanisms of aromatic amines on catalytic surfaces. Through a combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental techniques such as temperature programmed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TP-XPS), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and Fourier transform infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy(FT-IRRAS),we explored the coverage-dependent behaviour of NMA on Pt(111) to identify key steps in the activation process. The population of certain reaction paths is driven by a coverage dependent balance between molecule surface charge transfer and intermolecular interactions, dictating the selective activation of specific bonds. Our findings reveal how coverage influences the orientation and bonding of NMA on the Pt(111)surface. At lower coverages, the molecule binds to the surface through the phenyl ring and activation, facilitating C-N bond cleavage to the ring under HCN formation. In comparison, at higher coverages, the molecule binds only through the nitrogen atom and desorbs intact. These insights into variable bond activation lay the ground work for understanding the fundamental processes involved in potential heterogeneously catalyzed reactions of aromatic amines, contributing to the development of new catalytic strategies.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of thermoelectric properties of $\textrm{CeIr}_\textrm{4} \textrm{P}_\textrm{12}$ filled skutterudite for energy conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural, elastic, thermodynamic and thermoelectric characteristics of the $\textrm{CeIr}_\textrm{4} \textrm{P}_\textrm{12}$ skutterudite have been predicted for the first time by applying density functional theory and the semi-classical Boltzmann simulations. Firstly, the structural-magnetic stability was verified through ground-state energy calculations obtained from structural optimizations. The predicted single-crystal elastic constants (${C}_{ij}$) show that the title compound is mechanically stable. At the same time, it turns out to be dynamically stable where all the calculated phonon frequencies have positive values. The cohesive energy was calculated to verify the energy stability of the material considered. We also determined the variations of some macroscopic physical parameters as functions of temperature, namely the thermal expansion coefficient, the lattice thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we investigated the temperature dependencies of some thermoelectric coefficients such as electronic thermal conductivity, and figure of merit. Such encouraging results indicate that the compound is a potential candidate for thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Molecular Insights into the Crystallization of 4'-Hydroxyacetophenone from Water: Solute Aggregation, Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation and Polymorph Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work insights into the structural rearrangements occurring in aqueous solution, prior to the nucleation of different 4'-hydroxyacetophenone (HAP) forms from water were obtained, through a combination of thermomicroscopy, micro-differential scanning calorimetry, density and speed of sound measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results confirmed our previous observation that cooling crystallization of HAP is intermediated by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and, depending on the initially selected concentration range, selectively leads to the formation of different crystal forms. Analysis of the solution properties before the onset of LLPS revealed that, in the HAP mole fraction range xHAP \&lt; 0.004 (Zone I), where hydrate H2 ultimately crystallizes, small, solvated clusters are initially present in solution, which remain approximately invariant in size, shape and HAP/H2O proportion as the temperature decreases. For the xHAP \&amp;gt; 0.005 range (Zone III), where anhydrous form I crystallizes, large HAP/water aggregates (that can even percolate the whole system as xHAP approaches the 0.005 limit) are already initially present in solution. As cooling progresses, they become more compact, a process accompanied by a reduction in water content, and which is more significant as the solution concentration increases. The 0.004 \&lt; xHAP \&lt; 0.005 (Zone II) range corresponds to a transition region where, as xHAP increases, the physical properties of the solution initially evolve from those typical of Zone I and, at a certain point, abruptly change and start converging to those typical of Zone III. In all zones, the colloidal particles formed upon LLPS (from which crystallization results) can also reduce their water content on cooling, but the extent of this process increases as xHAP moves from Zones I and II, where hydrates are formed, to Zone III, where anhydrous Form I is produced.</description>

      <title>Defect Accumulation in beta-Ga2O3 Implanted with Yb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-induced crystal lattice damage and its recovery in wide bandgap oxides, in particular beta-gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3), is a complex process. This paper presents the first study on the process of the defects accumulation in beta-Ga2O3 implanted with Rare Earth (RE) ions and the impact of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) on the defects formed. (-201) oriented beta-Ga2O3 single crystals were implanted with Yb ions fluences ranging from 1 x 1012 to 5 x 1015 at/cm2. Channeling Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS/c) was used to study the crystal lattice damage induced by ion implantation and the level of structure recovery after annealing. The quantitative and qualitative analyses of collected spectra were performed by computer simulations. The resulting accumulation curve reveals a two-step damage process. In the first stage, the damage of the beta-Ga2O3 is inconspicuous, but begins to grow rapidly from the fluence of 1 x 1013 at/cm2, reaching the saturation at the random level for the Yb ion fluence of 1 x 1014 at/cm2. Further irradiation causes the damage peak to become bimodal, indicating that at least two new defect forms develop for the higher ion fluence. These two damage zones differently react to annealing, suggesting that they could origin from two phases, the amorphization phase and the new crystalline phase of Ga2O3.</description>

      <title>Rietveld Refinement and NMR Crystallographic Investigations of Multicomponent Crystals Containing Alkali Metal Chlorides and Urea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New mechanochemical preparations of three multicomponent crystals (MCCs) of the form MCl:urea.nH2O (M = Li+, Na+, and Cs+) are reported. Their structures were determined by an NMR crystallography approach, combining Rietveld refinement of synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data (PXRD), multinuclear (35Cl, 7Li, 23Na, and 133Cs) solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. Mechanochemical syntheses of the three MCCs, two of which are novel, are optimized for maximum yield and efficiency. 35Cl SSNMR is well-suited for the structural characterization of these MCCs since it is sensitive to subtle differences and/or changes in chloride ion environments, providing a powerful means of examining H...Cl-bonding environments. Alkali metal NMR is beneficial for identifying the number of unique magnetically and crystallographically distinct sites and enables facile detection of educts and/or impurities. In the case of NaCl:urea.H2O, 23Na MAS NMR spectra are key, both for identifying residual NaCl educt and for monitoring NaCl:urea.H2O degradation, which appears to proceed via an autocatalytic decomposition process driven by water (with a rate constant of k = 1.22x10-3 s-1). SSNMR and PXRD were used to inform the initial structural models. Following Rietveld refinement, the models were subjected to dispersion-corrected plane-wave DFT geometry optimizations and subsequent calculations of the 35Cl EFG tensors, which enable the refinement of hydrogen atom positions, as well as the exploration of their relationships to the local hydrogen bonding environments of the chloride ions and crystallographic symmetry elements.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in Stillinger-Weber Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of liquid and supercooled liquid silicon, modeled using the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential, to examine the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation. Towards this end, we examine the relationship among various dynamical quantities, including (i) the macroscopic transport coefficients - self diffusion coefficient $D$ and viscosity $\eta$, (ii) relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$ as well as (iii) lengthscale dependent relaxation times $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ over a broad range of temperature $T$, pressure $P$ and density $\rho$ covering both equilibrium and metastable liquid state points in the phase diagram. Our study shows a weak break down in SE relation involving $D$ and $\eta$, and the loci of \Revision{the breakdown of the SE relation} (SEB) is found in the high T liquid phase. The $\tau_{\alpha}$, when used as a proxy to $\eta$, shows distinct breakdown in the SE relation whose loci is found in the supercooled liquid phase. Interestingly, certain parts of the phase diagram shows that loci of onset of slow dynamics lie below the loci of SEB, suggesting a regime that exhibits Arrhenius but non-Fickian behaviour. Computation of $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ enables us to extract the lengthscale associated with the Fickian to non-Fickian behaviour using which we show that the \Revision{breakdown of the SE relation} occurs only below a specific lengthscale at a given temperature. Further we also compare the SEB loci with other features of the phase behaviour, including the loci of compressiblity maximum, density maximum as well as diffusivity maximum.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transformation between the magnetically ordered CeCoGe$_3$ and heavy fermion CeFeGe$_3$ is isostructural but not isoelectronic, therefore the characterization of the electronic structure of the CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ series is of special importance. We report both the experimental investigation by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and the first-principles calculations within the full-potential local-orbital (FPLO) scheme based on the density functional theory. Experimentally, we investigate mainly the valence band and the Ce $3d$ spectra, both giving the possibility to conclude about the level of the $f$ states localization. Computationally, we investigate the most characteristic CeCoGe$_3$, CeCo$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Ge$_3$, and CeFeGe$_3$ compositions. Based on the electronic band structure results, we calculate the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the valence band. We consider the effects of the spin-orbit coupling and intra-atomic Hubbard U repulsion. Furthermore, we discuss the charge distribution and occupation of valence-band orbitals. The experimentally observed evolution of the 3$d$ band with the Fe concentration is related to the decrease of the number of electrons and reduction of the 3$d$ photoionization cross-sections. Calculations indicate that charge is transferred mainly from the Ce to Ge sites and the bondings are formed mainly by the Ce 5$d$, Fe/Co 3$d$, and Ge 4$p$ and 4$s$ orbitals.</description>

      <title>Entropy-assisted, long-period stacking of honeycomb layers in an AlB2-type silicide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configurational entropy can impact crystallization processes, tipping the scales between structures of nearly equal internal energy. Using alloyed single crystals of Gd2PdSi3 in the AlB2-type structure, we explore the formation of complex layer sequences made from alternating, two-dimensional triangular and honeycomb slabs. A four-period and an eight-period stacking sequence are found to be very close in internal energy, the latter being favored by entropy associated with covering the full configuration space of interlayer bonds. Possible consequences of polytype formation on magnetism in Gd2PdSi3 are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dzyalonshinskii-Moriya interaction in Fe5GeTe2 epitaxial thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals ferromagnets, such as Fe5GeTe2, offer a promising platform for spintronic devices based on chiral magnetic textures, provided a significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) can be induced to stabilise them. Here, we directly measure DMI in epitaxial Fe5GeTe2 thin films using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and observe a consistent DMI (D = 0.04 mJ/m2) across various thicknesses. Its weak thickness dependence, combined with the nominally symmetric film interfaces, suggests a bulk origin. Although we do not determine the microscopic mechanism, our findings are compatible with ab-initio calculations linking DMI to partial ordering of Fe split sites. Additionally, we find a low magnetic dissipation (alpha &lt; 0.003). The observed DMI, which could be further enhanced by optimising the Fe site ordering, combined with low dissipation, makes Fe5GeTe2 a strong candidate for exploring the dynamics of chiral magnetic textures in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Nuclear and Magnetic Structures of Wolframite-Type MgReO4 and ZnReO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilized high-pressure methods to synthesize the oxides AReO$4$ (A=Zn, Mg) and characterized their crystal structures as monoclinic wolframite-type. By combining muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu^+$SR) with DFT calculations for muon stopping sites, we identify two possible magnetic spin structures for both compounds: $\Gamma_3$ with the propagation vector $\mathbf{k} = (0,1/2,0)$ and $\Gamma_4$ with $\mathbf{k} = (0,0,0)$. In both cases, the magnetic moments are canted from the principal axes within the $ac$-plane. The ordered moment of the proposed structures is $\mathbf{0.29(5)~\mu\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_3$ and $\mathbf{0.25(8)~\mu_\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_4$. The low moment is consistent with the absence of a magnetic contribution to the neutron powder diffraction (NPD) spectra. Bond valence sum (BVS) analysis supports the oxidation state of Re being Re$^{6+}$ in the compounds, and we suggest that a combination of $t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbital splitting due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and $d$-$p$ orbital hybridization is responsible for the strongly suppressed ordered magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Accurate Formula for the Effective Conductivity of Highly Clustered Two-Phase Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-phase heterogeneous materials arising in a variety of natural and synthetic situations exhibit a wide-variety of microstructures and thus display a broad-spectrum effective physical properties. Given that such properties of disordered materials generally depend on an infinite-set of microstructural correlation functions that are typically unobtainable, in practice, one must consider rigorous bounds and approximations on the effective properties that depend on a limited set of nontrivial microstructural information. Torquato derived [Random Heterogeneous Materials, Microstructure and Macroscopic Properties (2002)] such an approximation for the effective thermal/electrical conductivity of two-phase microstructures that perturb about those that realize the well-known self-consistent formula; a key feature of such microstructures being phase-inversion symmetry which can be observed in certain cellular, bicontinuous, and porous materials. Here, we show via extensive numerical simulations that this virtually unexamined approximation, which depends on up to three-point correlations, predicts accurately the effective conductivities of various two- and three-dimensional two-phase microstructures across phase volume fractions in which both phases can form large and well-connected clusters; including certain phase-inversion symmetric microstructures as well as phase-inversion asymmetric dispersions of certain fully penetrable particles. We also highlight the accurate sensitivity of this approximation to phase-connectedness properties by showing that it predicts percolation thresholds that are in good quantitative and/or qualitative agreement with known thresholds for the models considered here. Finally, we discuss how this formula can be used to design materials with desirable effective conductivity properties and thus aid in materials by design.</description>

      <title>Large deformation and collapse analysis of re-entrant auxetic and hexagonal honeycomb lattice structures subjected to tension and compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additively manufactured auxetic structures offer desirable qualities like lightweight, good energy absorption, excellent indentation resistance, high shear stiffness and fracture toughness among others. A wide range of materials from polymers to metals can be used to fabricate these structures. In contrast to conventional materials, auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. Hence, unique mechanical properties can be achieved by specific design. In this work, two types of structures, namely re-entrant auxetic and non-auxetic hexagonal honeycomb, are investigated. Large deformation analyses in both 2D plane strain and 3D are conducted using linear triangular and tetrahedral multi-field displacement-pressure elements. Hyperelastic with rate-independent plasticity constitutive models are utilized and calibrated with experimental uni-axial tensile test results. The structures are subjected to compression and tension at both transversal and longitudinal directions. The contact domain method is employed to capture both self-contact and the interaction between the structure and loading plates. The obtained results show consistency with the experimental data. The outcomes of the analyses regarding the re-entrant auxetic structure agree with the expected behavior, showing a negative value of Poisson's ratio and greater efficiency of energy absorption than the hexagonal honeycomb. By understanding the influence of the loading direction on the structural behavior, equivalent Poisson's ratio and energy absorption a reliable theoretical framework for prospective designs of the lattice materials can be established.</description>

      <title>A geometrically inspired constitutive framework for damage and intrinsic self-healing of elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomic interfacial self-healing in elastomers enables their reprocessing and recycling, making them valuable for applications such as ballistic resistance, surface coatings, adhesives, and biomedical materials. This article prescribes a geometry-based damage-healing theory for autonomic healing in elastomers, built on a framework where damage induces an incompatibility in the Euclidean material manifold, transforming it into a Riemannian manifold. Healing restores the Euclidean state through a reversing damage variable or an evolving healing variable. The reversing damage variable models the rebonding mechanism while the healing variable accounts for healing by chain diffusion and entanglement. The model also predicts healing where rebonding is preceded by chain diffusion. The microforce balance governs the evolution of the damage and healing variables, capturing rate-dependent damage and intrinsic temperature-independent healing. The model is validated through numerical simulations, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations, demonstrating accurate predictions of coupling between damage and healing and post-healing mechanical response. The model also predicts the recovery of fracture toughness with healing time in supramolecular elastomers, aligning with experimental data. With minimal parameters, the model is versatile and can easily be used for material design and structural analysis, surpassing existing models in simplicity and predictive capability.</description>

      <title>Pseudopotentials that move: From inertia to electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have pointed out some worrisome inconsistencies in linear-response calculations performed with nonlocal pseudopotentials. Here we show that most of these issues are fixed by correctly adapting the pseudopotential to the motion of the corresponding nucleus, with a velocity dependence of the nonlocal operator. This prescription restores the correct Galilean covariance of the Schr\"odinger equation, and the expected identity between mechanical rototranslations and electromagnetic perturbations. We demonstrate our arguments by relating the interatomic force constants to the electromagnetic susceptibility of the system via a set of exact sum rules. Among other virtues, these results conclusively reconcile the inertial and electrical definitions of the Drude weight in metals.</description>

      <title>Dome-like pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineering in Large-Scale CVD-Grown Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Formation, Spectroscopy, and Spin Relaxation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, numerous techniques have been reported for generating optically active defects in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which hold transformative potential for quantum photonic devices. However, achieving on-demand generation of desirable defect types in scalable hBN films remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that formation of negative boron vacancy defects, VB-, in suspended, large-area CVD-grown hBN is strongly dependent on the type of bombarding particles (ions, neutrons, and electrons) and irradiation conditions. In contrast to suspended hBN, defect formation in substrate-supported hBN is more complex due to the uncontrollable generation of secondary particles from the substrate, and the outcome strongly depends on the thickness of the hBN. We identify different defect types by correlating spectroscopic and optically detected magnetic resonance features, distinguishing boron vacancies (formed by light ions and neutrons) from other optically active defects emitting at 650 nm assigned to anti-site nitrogen vacancy (NBVN) and reveal the presence of additional dark paramagnetic defects that influence spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and zero-field splitting parameters, all of which strongly depend on the defect density. These results underscore the potential for precisely engineered defect formation in large-scale CVD-grown hBN, paving the way for the scalable fabrication of quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for computing power has been growing exponentially with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This growth requires unconventional computing primitives that prioritize energy efficiency, while also addressing the critical need for scalability. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the biological brain, offers a transformative paradigm for addressing these challenges. This review paper provides an overview of advancements in 2D spintronics and device architectures designed for neuromorphic applications, with a focus on techniques such as spin-orbit torque, magnetic tunnel junctions, and skyrmions. Emerging van der Waals materials like CrI3, Fe3GaTe2, and graphene-based heterostructures have demonstrated unparalleled potential for integrating memory and logic at the atomic scale.

      <title>Refining spectroscopic calculations for trivalent lanthanide ions: a revised parametric Hamiltonian and open-source solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The historical calculation of spectroscopic properties for trivalent lanthanide ions is a complex multistep process that has been prone to inaccuracies. In this work, we revise the parametric semi-empirical Hamiltonian and address long-standing discrepancies in the literature. We also resurface the distinctions between orthogonal and non-orthogonal operators and use orthogonal operators to provide an alternative parametric description. Based on experimental data available in the literature, a new set of parameter values for the ions in LaF$_3$ and LiYF$_4$ is presented. Additionally, we provide calculations of spontaneous emission rates and oscillator strengths for magnetic dipole transitions in the LaF$_3$ crystal host. To ensure the replicability of our findings, we make available the open-source code $\mathbf{\texttt{qlanth}}$, accompanied by a comprehensive set of electronic files to serve as an updated reference for future calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum ATK Analysis and Detection of Toxic Gases Nitrogen Oxide using Pristine, Defective, and Doped Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While doping and defects are often considered detrimental to material performance, at the nanoscale, modifications are needed to create novel properties beneficial for device applications. In this work, we focus on optimizing graphene as a gas sensor for detecting toxic gases such as nitrogen oxide (NO). The study explores the effects of doping graphene sheets with transition metals (Cu, Au, Pt) and introducing a single vacancy (SV) defect at the center of the sheet. Pristine, defected, and doped graphene sheets are systematically analyzed as potential sensing materials for NO gas detection. The investigation includes the design of graphene-based devices and the evaluation of their electrical I-V characteristics under different configurations. The sensing mechanism is examined through parameters such as electronic properties, charge transfer, adsorption energy, electrical characteristics (I-V), sensitivity, and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. The results indicate that defected graphene demonstrates superior gas adsorption performance, with an adsorption energy of 8.316 eV and a sensitivity of 51.1%, outperforming both pristine and doped graphene. These findings establish defected graphene as a promising candidate for NO gas sensing applications, while doped graphene shows moderate sensing potential.</description>

      <title>An atomistic approach for modeling of polarizability and Raman scattering of water clusters and liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a framework for atomistic modeling of electronic polarizability to predict the Raman spectra of hydrogen-bonded clusters and liquids from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The total polarizability of the system is assumed to arise from contributions of both the monomer unit and intermolecular interactions. The generalized bond-polarizability model (GBPM), inspired by the classic bond-polarizability model, effectively describes the electronic polarizability of a monomer. To account for the electronic polarizability arising from intermolecular interactions, we use a basis set of rapidly decaying functions of interatomic distances. We apply this model to calculate the electronic polarizability and Raman spectra of water clusters ((H2O)r, r = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and liquid water. The computational results are compared with the results of quantum-mechanical calculations for clusters and to experimental data for the liquid. It is demonstrated that this simple and physically motivated model, which relies on a small number of parameters, performs well for clusters at both low and high temperatures, capturing strong anharmonic effects. Moreover, its high transferability suggests its applicability to other water clusters. These results suggest that a hierarchical approach based on the Jacob's ladder of increasingly sophisticated and accurate atomistic polarizability models incorporating additional effects can be used for efficient modeling of Raman spectra from MD simulations of clusters, liquids and solids.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with Global Charge Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to quantum mechanical simulations for predicting material properties. Message-passing graph neural networks, commonly used in these MLIPs, rely on local descriptor-based symmetry functions to model atomic interactions. However, such local descriptor-based approaches struggle with systems exhibiting long-range interactions, charge transfer, and compositional heterogeneity. In this work, we develop a new equivariant MLIP incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions through explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom, specifically global charge distribution within the system. This is achieved using a charge equilibration scheme based on predicted atomic electronegativities. We systematically evaluate our model across a range of benchmark periodic and non-periodic datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both short-range equivariant and long-range invariant MLIPs in energy and force predictions. Our approach enables more accurate and efficient simulations of systems with long-range interactions and charge heterogeneity, expanding the applicability of MLIPs in computational materials science.</description>

      <title>Optically tunable spin Hall effect in periodically driven monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the driving field of circularly polarized light (CPL) can be used to enhance and reverse the spin current generated in the spin Hall effect for some transition-metal dichalcogenides. This is demonstrated by analyzing the time-averaged spin Hall conductivities in the nonequilibrium steady states of monolayers WS$_{2}$, MoS$_{2}$, MoTe$_{2}$, and WTe$_{2}$ driven by CPL with the Floquet linear-response theory. We argue that the enhancement and reversals of the spin current come from a combination of the non-Rashba effect of broken inversion symmetry and the nonperturbative effect of CPL beyond the dynamical localization. This work allows optical control of the magnitude and direction of the pure spin current.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in co-doped infinite-layer samarium nickelate thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small c-axis parameter of 3.26 {\AA} and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. We observe distinct magnetotransport behaviors in europium-containing samples, including negative magnetoresistance and field-enhanced superconductivity. By establishing a clear correlation between decreasing c-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems, these findings establish clear materials design principles for achieving higher transition temperatures in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.</description>

      <title>Nanometric skyrmion lattice from anisotropic exchange interactions in a centrosymmetric host</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmion formation in centrosymmetric magnets without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions was originally predicted from unbiased numerical techniques. However, no attempt has yet been made, by comparison to a real material, to determine the salient interaction terms and model parameters driving spin-vortex formation. We identify a Hamiltonian with anisotropic exchange couplings, local ion anisotropy, and four-spin interactions, which is generally applicable to this class of compounds. In the representative system Gd3Ru4Al12, anisotropic exchange drives a fragile balance between helical, skyrmion lattice, and transverse conical (cycloidal) orders. The model is severely constrained by the experimentally observed collapse of the SkL with a small in-plane magnetic field. For the zero-field helical state, we further anticipate that spins can be easily rotated out of the spiral plane by a tilted magnetic field or applied current.</description>

      <title>Optimizing compensation in Ising spin-$1/2$ site-diluted trilayered square ferrimagnets: Insights from Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study employs Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to investigate the thermomagnetic properties of a site-diluted trilayered ferrimagnetic system with spin-$1/2$ particles placed on square monolayers. The system is composed of two different types of theoretical atoms, labeled $A$ and $B$, resulting in two distinct configurations, $ABA$ and $AAB$. Atoms of the same type $(A-A$ and $B-B)$ exhibit ferromagnetic interactions, while unlike atoms $(A-B)$ display antiferromagnetic interactions. The $A$-layers are randomly site-diluted with non-magnetic atoms and the percentage of dilution is varied from 5\% to 45\%. Depending upon the concentration of these impurities, both the compensation and critical points shift, leading to different equilibrium ferrimagnetic behaviors. The phase area in the Hamiltonian parameter space, \textit{without} compensation, scales according to the relation: $\ln |A(\rho)/\tilde{A}|=ae^{b\rho}$ . Attention is paid to the mathematical relationships between the compensation temperature and the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities. Suggested mathematical formulas reveal how the threshold impurity concentration is linked to the Hamiltonian parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</description>

      <title>Unusually Strong Four-Phonon Scattering Effects on Low-Temperature Thermal Conductivity in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First principles-based predictions of lattice thermal conductivity (TC) from perturbation theory have achieved significant success. Usually, it only included three-phonon (3ph) scattering processes, only recently four-phonon (4ph) scattering processes were found to have a comparable impact as 3ph scattering at medium and high temperatures in various materials. While the influence of 4ph scattering on TC at low temperatures was generally believed to be insignificant. By combining the first-principles calculations, machine learning techniques, and Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), we find that there are unusually strong 4ph processes even in the low-frequency range of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as h-XN (X = B, Al, Ga), which have a remarkable influence on the low-temperature TC. Such strong 4ph processes originated from the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) phonon mode of 2D materials. Furthermore, we find that the intensity of 4ph scattering and thus TC can be effectively manipulated by changing the dispersion of ZA phonon mode, which can be easily achieved through strain engineering. The present study provides new insights into low-temperature phonon transport and its manipulation in 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral and transport properties of strongly correlated metals, such as SrVO$_3$ (SVO), are widely attributed to electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions, with lattice vibrations (phonons) playing a secondary role. Here, using first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show that $e$-ph interactions play an essential role in SVO: they govern the electron scattering and resistivity in a wide temperature range above 30 K, and induce an experimentally observed kink in the spectral function. In contrast, the $e$-$e$ interactions control quasiparticle renormalizations and low temperature transport, and enhance the $e$-ph coupling. We clarify the origin of the near $T^2$ temperature dependence of the resistivity by analyzing the $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph limited transport regimes. Our work disentangles the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in a prototypical correlated metal, revealing the dominant role of $e$-ph interactions in SVO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge of the domain of applicability of a machine learning model is essential to ensuring accurate and reliable model predictions. In this work, we develop a new and general approach of assessing model domain and demonstrate that our approach provides accurate and meaningful domain designation across multiple model types and material property data sets. Our approach assesses the distance between data in feature space using kernel density estimation, where this distance provides an effective tool for domain determination. We show that chemical groups considered unrelated based on chemical knowledge exhibit significant dissimilarities by our measure. We also show that high measures of dissimilarity are associated with poor model performance (i.e., high residual magnitudes) and poor estimates of model uncertainty (i.e., unreliable uncertainty estimation). Automated tools are provided to enable researchers to establish acceptable dissimilarity thresholds to identify whether new predictions of their own machine learning models are in-domain versus out-of-domain.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</description>

Selection rules limit the allowed scattering directions, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches, and features may appear with no clear explanation. To explore both, we perform frequency-resolved q-EELS simulations via the multislice method and compare results to Spectral Energy Density (SED) and Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. We discuss common misconceptions of phonon behavior and characterization generally and in the context of measured or simulated q-EELS signals. We highlight the presence of an ``interferometric Brillouin zone'' (closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor), resulting from the simultaneous sampling of the lattice across each basis index. We also demonstrate the scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective signal based on this phenomena. Finally, we identify thickness-dependent sensitivity effects, where the upper surface of a film is sampled at a disproportionate level. We show that this can yield sensitivity to through-plane vibrational modes, which may be measured experimentally assuming sufficient sensitivity can be achieved. Our work should serve as a road map to guide momentum-resolved vibrational EELS measurements in the future, particularly as ever-increasing energy and momentum resolution becomes available.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum metric, a probe to spacetime of the Hilbert space, has been found measurable in the nonlinear electronic transport thus has attracted tremendous interest. However, without comparing with mechanisms tied to disorder, it is still unclear whether the quantum metric dominates in recent experiments. We exhaust all possible mechanisms of nonlinear transport under the same symmetry that the quantum metric emerges, by finding five more disorder-related mechanisms and their nonlinear conductivity formulas. With the help of the formulas, we derive the scaling law to identify distinct mechanisms in the recent experiments [Gao, et al., Science 381, 181 (2023); Wang, et al., Nature 621, 487 (2023)], determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for all 122 magnetic point groups to guide future experiments, and calculate the nonlinear conductivity to explain the sophisticated features in the experiments of the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films. Our theory will facilitate future experiments and applications of nonlinear transport.</description>

      <title>Resistively detected electron spin resonance and g-factor in few-layer exfoliated MoS2 devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MoS2 has recently emerged as a promising material for enabling quantum devices and spintronic applications. In this context, an improved physical understanding of the g-factor of MoS2 depending on device geometry is of great importance. Resistively detected electron spin resonance (RD-ESR) could be employed to and the determine the g-factor in micron-scale devices However, its application and RD-ESR studies have been limited by Schottky or high-resistance contacts to MoS2. Here, we exploit naturally n-doped few-layer MoS2 devices with ohmic tin (Sn) contacts that allow the electrical study of spin phenomena. Resonant excitation of electron spins and resistive detection is a possible path to exploit the spin effects in MoS2 devices. Using RD-ESR, we determine the g-factor of few-layer MoS2 to be ~1.92 and observe that the g-factor value is independent of the charge carrier density within the limits of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Darkness in interlayer and charge density wave states of 2H-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wave-like nature of electrons is evident from quantum interference effects observed during the photoemission process. When there are different nuclei in the unit cell of a crystal and/or structural distortions, photo-electron wavefunctions can interfere, giving rise to peculiar intensity modulation of the spectrum, which can also hide energy states in a photoemission experiment. The 2H phase of transition metal dichalcogenides, with two nonequivalent layers per unit cell and charge density wave distortion, is an optimal platform for such effects to be observed. Here, we discover undetectable states in 2H-TaS2, interpreting high-resolution angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy considering interference effects of the correlated electron wave functions. In addition, phase mismatching induced by the charge density wave distortion, results in evident signature of the phase transition in the photoemission spectrum. Our results highlight the importance of quantum interference, electronic correlations and structural distortion to understand the physics of layered materials.</description>

      <title>The effects of fibre spatial distribution and relative orientation on the percolation and mechanics of stochastic fibre networks: A model of peptide hydrogels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structures of fibre networks can vary greatly due to fibre interactions during formation. We have modified the steps of generating Mikado networks to create two new model classes by altering the spatial distribution and relative orientation of their fibres to mimic the structures of self-assembling peptide hydrogels (SAPHs), whose physical properties depend strongly on their fibres' interactions. The results of our models and experiments on a set of beta-sheet forming SAPHs show that modifying a network's structure affects the percolation threshold and the mechanical behaviour of the material, both near percolation and at higher densities.</description>

      <title>Onset of wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a methodology for inducing wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs. A non-reciprocal wave equation of Willis-type is first considered, and its wave dispersion analyses are carried out via the transfer matrix method. By creating unit cells from two identical Willis-type elastic layers, yet with reversed Willis-coupling signs, a reciprocal band structure peculiarly emerges, although each layer exhibits non-reciprocity if considered individually. Wavenumber bandgaps open due to such unit cell configuration, and their width and limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with reversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted, followed by concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>Amorphous silicon structures generated using a moment tensor potential and the activation relaxation technique nouveau</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing realistic atom-scale models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a decades-old condensed matter physics challenge. Herein, we combine the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to generate seven a-Si models containing between 216 and 4096 atoms. A thorough analysis of their short-range and medium-range structural properties is performed, alongside assessments of excess energy and mechanical properties. The seven ARTn-MTP models are compared with available experimental data and other high quality a-Si models present in the literature. The seven ARTn-MTP a-Si models are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. Notably, several of our models, including the 216-atom, 512-atom, and 1000-atom a-Si models, exhibit low coordination defects without any traces of crystalline grains. Historically overlooked in previous research, our study underlines the need to assess the validity of the continuous random-network hypothesis for the description of perfect amorphous model by characterizing local crystalline environment and to explore the crystallisation process of a-Si through modelling.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Crystal field splittings and magnetic ground state of the square-lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 with Jeff = 1/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the crystal field level splitting and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 using powder inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and neutron diffraction measurements. Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation in single conjugated polymer chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and its time dependence. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number rises only to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophores that facilitates efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. The results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised to control exciton-exciton annihilation.</description>
