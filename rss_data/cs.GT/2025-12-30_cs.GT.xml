      <title>Analyzing Skill Element in Online Fantasy Cricket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online fantasy cricket has emerged as large-scale competitive systems in which participants construct virtual teams and compete based on real-world player performances. This massive growth has been accompanied by important questions about whether outcomes are primarily driven by skill or chance. We develop a statistical framework to assess the role of skill in determining success on these platforms. We construct and analyze a range of deterministic and stochastic team selection strategies, based on recent form, historical statistics, statistical optimization, and multi-criteria decision making. Strategy performance is evaluated based on points, ranks, and payoff under two contest structures Mega and 4x or Nothing. An extensive comparison between different strategies is made to find an optimal set of strategies. To capture adaptive behavior, we further introduce a dynamic tournament model in which agent populations evolve through a softmax reweighting mechanism proportional to positive payoff realizations. We demonstrate our work by running extensive numerical experiments on the IPL 2024 dataset. The results provide quantitative evidence in favor of the skill element present in online fantasy cricket platforms.</description>

      <title>Computing Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibria in a Two-Party Policy Competition: Existence and Algorithmic Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate two-party policy competition as a two-player non-cooperative game, generalizing Lin et al.'s work (2021). Each party selects a real-valued policy vector as its strategy from a compact subset of Euclidean space, and a voter's utility for a policy is given by the inner product with their preference vector. To capture the uncertainty in the competition, we assume that a policy's winning probability increases monotonically with its total utility across all voters, and we formalize this via an affine isotonic function. A player's payoff is defined as the expected utility received by its supporters. In this work, we first test and validate the isotonicity hypothesis through voting simulations. Next, we prove the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in both one- and multi-dimensional settings. Although we construct a counterexample demonstrating the game's non-monotonicity, our experiments show that a decentralized gradient-based algorithm typically converges rapidly to an approximate PSNE. Finally, we present a grid-based search algorithm that finds an $\epsilon$-approximate PSNE of the game in time polynomial in the input size and $1/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games for Multi-Location Agents with Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study mechanism design for single-facility location games where each agent has multiple private locations in [0, 1]. The individual objective is a satisfaction function that measures the discrepancy between the optimal facility location for an agent and the location provided by the mechanism. Based on different distance functions from agents to the facility, we consider two types of individual objectives: the sum-variant satisfaction and the max-variant satisfaction. Our goal is to design mechanisms that locate one facility to maximize the sum (or the minimum) of all agents' satisfactions, while incentivizing agents to truthfully report their locations. In this paper, we mainly focus on desirable and obnoxious facility location games. For desirable facility location games, we propose two group strategy-proof mechanisms with approximation ratios of 2 and 5/4 for maximizing the sum of the sum-variant and max-variant satisfaction, respectively. Moreover, another mechanism achieves an approximation ratio of 2 for simultaneously maximizing the minimum of the sum-variant satisfaction and the minimum of the max-variant satisfaction. For obnoxious facility location games, we establish that two group strategy-proof mechanisms are the best possible, providing an approximation ratio of 2 for maximizing the sum of the sum-variant satisfaction and the sum of the max-variant satisfaction, respectively. Additionally, we devise two 4/3-approximation randomized group strategy-proof mechanisms, and provide two lower bounds of 1.0625 and 1.0448 of randomized strategy-proof mechanisms for maximizing the sum of the sum-variant satisfaction and the sum of the max-variant satisfaction, respectively.</description>

      <title>Impact of Volatility on Time-Based Transaction Ordering Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Arbitrum's Express Lane Auction (ELA), an ahead-of-time second-price auction that grants the winner an exclusive latency advantage for one minute. Building on a single-round model with risk-averse bidders, we propose a hypothesis that the value of priority access is discounted relative to risk-neutral valuation due to the difficulty of forecasting short-horizon volatility and bidders' risk aversion. We test these predictions using ELA bid records matched to high-frequency ETH prices and find that the result is consistent with the model.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Off-Chain Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current DAO governance praxis limits organizational expressivity and reduces complex organizational decisions to token-weighted voting due to on-chain computational limits. This paper proposes verifiable off-chain computation (leveraging Verifiable Services, TEEs, and ZK proofs) as a framework to transcend these constraints while maintaining cryptoeconomic security. This paper explores three novel governance mechanisms: (1) attestation-based systems that compute multi-dimensional stakeholder legitimacy, (2) collective intelligence through verifiable preference processing, and (3) autonomous policy execution via Policy-as-Code. The framework provides architectural specifications, security models, and implementation considerations for DAOs seeking higher-resolution expressivity and increased operational efficiency, with validation from pioneering implementations demonstrating practical viability.</description>

      <title>Beyond Exact Fairness: Envy-Free Incomplete Connected Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of Envy-Free Incomplete Connected Fair Division, where exactly p vertices of an undirected graph must be allocated to agents such that each agent receives a connected share and does not envy another agent's share. Focusing on agents with additive valuations, we show that the problem remains computationally hard when parameterized by p and the number of agents. This result holds even for star graphs and with the input numbers given in unary representation, thereby resolving an open problem posed by Gahlawat and Zehavi (FSTTCS 2023).
  In stark contrast, we show that if one is willing to tolerate even the slightest amount of envy, then the problem becomes efficient with respect to the natural parameters. Specifically, we design an Efficient Parameterized Approximation Scheme parameterized by p and the number of agent types. Our algorithm works on general graphs and remains efficient even when the input numbers are provided in binary representation.</description>

      <title>Cyber Resilience in Next-Generation Networks: Threat Landscape, Theoretical Foundations, and Design Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of networked systems, driven by innovations in software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), open radio access networks (O-RAN), and cloud-native architectures, is redefining both the operational landscape and the threat surface of critical infrastructures. This book offers an in-depth, interdisciplinary examination of how resilience must be re-conceptualized and re-engineered to address the multifaceted challenges posed by these transformations.
  Structured across six chapters, this book begins by surveying the contemporary risk landscape, identifying emerging cyber, physical, and AI-driven threats, and analyzing their implications for scalable, heterogeneous network environments. It then establishes rigorous definitions and evaluation frameworks for resilience, going beyond robustness and fault-tolerance to address adaptive, anticipatory, and retrospective mechanisms across diverse application domains.
  The core of the book delves into advanced paradigms and practical strategies for resilience, including zero trust architectures, game-theoretic threat modeling, and self-healing design principles. A significant portion is devoted to the role of artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs), in enabling dynamic threat response, autonomous network control, and multi-agent coordination under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Reach-Avoid Differential game with Reachability Analysis for UAVs: A decomposition approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reach-avoid (RA) games have significant applications in security and defense, particularly for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These problems are inherently challenging due to the need to consider obstacles, consider the adversarial nature of opponents, ensure optimality, and account for nonlinear dynamics. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling these challenges; however, while it has been applied to games involving two spatial dimensions, directly extending this approach to three spatial dimensions is impossible due to high dimensionality. On the other hand, alternative approaches for solving RA games lack the generality to consider games with three spatial dimensions involving agents with non-trivial system dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dimensionality reduction by decomposing the problem into a horizontal RA sub-game and a vertical RA sub-game. We then solve each sub-game using HJ reachability analysis and consider second-order dynamics that account for the defender's acceleration. To reconstruct the solution to the original RA game from the sub-games, we introduce a HJ-based tracking control algorithm in each sub-game that not only guarantees capture of the attacker but also tracking of the attacker thereafter. We prove the conditions under which the capture guarantees are maintained. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via numerical simulations, showing that the decomposition maintains optimality and guarantees in the original problem. Our methods are also validated in a Gazebo physics simulator, achieving successful capture of quadrotors in three spatial dimensions space for the first time to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study axiomatic foundations of Bayesian persuasion, where a principal (i.e., sender) delegates the task of choice making after informing a biased agent (i.e., receiver) about the payoff relevant uncertain state (see, e.g., Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011)). Our characterizations involve novel models of Bayesian persuasion, where the principal can steer the agent's bias after acquiring costly information. Importantly, we provide an elicitation method using only observable menu-choice data of the principal, which shows how to construct the principal's subjective costs of acquiring information even when he anticipates managing the agent's bias.</description>

      <title>Why AI Safety Requires Uncertainty, Incomplete Preferences, and Non-Archimedean Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe? We can study this problem through the frameworks of the AI assistance and the AI shutdown games. The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently. In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.</description>

      <title>NashOpt -- A Python Library for Computing Generalized Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NashOpt is an open-source Python library for computing and designing generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) in noncooperative games with shared constraints and real-valued decision variables. The library exploits the joint Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of all players to handle both general nonlinear GNEs and linear-quadratic games, including their variational versions. Nonlinear games are solved via nonlinear least-squares formulations, relying on JAX for automatic differentiation. Linear-quadratic GNEs are reformulated as mixed-integer linear programs, enabling efficient computation of multiple equilibria. The framework also supports inverse-game and Stackelberg game-design problems. The capabilities of NashOpt are demonstrated through several examples, including noncooperative game-theoretic control problems of linear quadratic regulation and model predictive control. The library is available at https://github.com/bemporad/nashopt</description>

      <title>Computing Balanced Solutions for Large International Kidney Exchange Schemes When Cycle Length Is Unbounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In kidney exchange programmes (KEP) patients may swap their incompatible donors leading to cycles of kidney transplants. Nowadays, countries try to merge their national patient-donor pools leading to international KEPs (IKEPs). As shown in the literature, long-term stability of an IKEP can be achieved through a credit-based system. In each round, every country is prescribed a "fair" initial allocation of kidney transplants. The initial allocation, which we obtain by using solution concepts from cooperative game theory, is adjusted by incorporating credits from the previous round, yielding the target allocation. The goal is to find, in each round, an optimal solution that closely approximates this target allocation. There is a known polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal solution that lexicographically minimizes the country deviations from the target allocation if only $2$-cycles (matchings) are permitted. In practice, kidney swaps along longer cycles may be performed. However, the problem of computing optimal solutions for maximum cycle length $\ell$ is NP-hard for every $\ell\geq 3$. This situation changes back to polynomial time once we allow unbounded cycle length. However, in contrast to the case where $\ell=2$, we show that for $\ell=\infty$, lexicographical minimization is only polynomial-time solvable under additional conditions (assuming P $\neq$ NP). Nevertheless, the fact that the optimal solutions themselves can be computed in polynomial time if $\ell=\infty$ still enables us to perform a large scale experimental study for showing how stability and total social welfare are affected when we set $\ell=\infty$ instead of $\ell=2$.</description>

Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) study auction design in the Blockchain context, and emphasize robustness against miner and user collusion, moreso than traditional auction theory. \cite{chung2023foundations} introduce the notion of a mechanism being $c$-Side-Contract-Proof ($c$-SCP), i.e., robust to a collusion of the miner and $c$ users. Later work \cite{chung2024collusion,welfareIncreasingCollusion} shows a gap between the $1$-SCP and $2$-SCP classes. We show that the class of $2$-SCP mechanisms equals that of any $c$-SCP with $c\geq 2$, under a relatively minor assumption of consistent tie-breaking. In essence, this implies that any mechanism vulnerable to collusion, is also vulnerable to a small collusion.</description>

      <title>On Computing the Shapley Value in Bankruptcy Games -llustrated by Rectified Linear Function Game-</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, we discuss a problem of calculating the Shapley value in bankruptcy games. We show that the decision problem of computing the Shapley value in bankruptcy games is NP-complete. We also investigate the relationship between the Shapley value of bankruptcy games and the Shapley-Shubik index in weighted voting games. The relation naturally implies a dynamic programming technique for calculating the Shapley value. We also present two recursive algorithms for computing the Shapley value: the first is the recursive completion method originally proposed by O'Neill, and the second is our novel contribution based on the dual game formulation. These recursive approaches offer conceptual clarity and computational efficiency, especially when combined with memoisation technique. Finally, we propose a Fully Polynomial-Time Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) based on Monte Carlo sampling, providing an efficient approximation method for large-scale instances.</description>

      <title>Stable Voting and the Splitting of Cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms for resolving majority cycles in preference aggregation have been studied extensively in computational social choice. Several sophisticated cycle-resolving methods, including Tideman's Ranked Pairs, Schulze's Beat Path, and Heitzig's River, are refinements of the Split Cycle (SC) method that resolves majority cycles by discarding the weakest majority victories in each cycle. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit proposed a new refinement of Split Cycle, dubbed Stable Voting, and a simplification thereof, called Simple Stable Voting (SSV). They conjectured that SSV is a refinement of SC whenever no two majority victories are of the same size. In this paper, we prove the conjecture up to 6 alternatives and refute it for more than 6 alternatives. While our proof of the conjecture for up to 5 alternatives uses traditional mathematical reasoning, our 6-alternative proof and 7-alternative counterexample were obtained with the use of SAT solving. The SAT encoding underlying this proof and counterexample is applicable far beyond SC and SSV: it can be used to test properties of any voting method whose choice of winners depends only on the ordering of margins of victory by size.</description>

      <title>Coarse Q-learning in Decision-Making: Indifference vs. Indeterminacy vs. Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Coarse Q-learning (CQL), a reinforcement learning model of decision-making under payoff uncertainty where alternatives are exogenously partitioned into coarse similarity classes (based on limited salience) and the agent maintains estimates (valuations) of expected payoffs only at the class level. Choices are modeled as softmax (multinomial logit) over class valuations and uniform within class; and valuations update toward realized payoffs as in classical Q-learning with stochastic bandit feedback (Watkins and Dayan, 1992). Using stochastic approximation, we derive a continuous-time ODE limit of CQL dynamics and show that its steady states coincide with smooth (logit) perturbations of Valuation Equilibria (Jehiel and Samet, 2007). We demonstrate the possibility of multiple equilibria in decision trees with generic payoffs and establish local asymptotic stability of strict pure equilibria whenever they exist. By contrast, we provide sufficient conditions on the primitives under which every decision tree admits a unique, globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium that renders the agent indifferent across classes as sensitivity to payoff differences diverges. Nevertheless, convergence to equilibrium is not universal: we construct an open set of decision trees where the unique mixed equilibrium is linearly unstable and the valuations converge to a stable limit cycle - with choice probabilities perpetually oscillating.</description>

      <title>Fare Zone Assignment on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tariff setting in public transportation networks is an important challenge. A popular approach is to partition the network into fare zones ("zoning") and fix journey prices depending on the number of traversed zones ("pricing"). In this paper, we focus on finding revenue-optimal solutions to the zoning problem for a given concave pricing function. We consider tree networks with $n$ vertices, since trees already pose non-trivial algorithmic challenges. Our main results are efficient algorithms that yield a simple $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation as well as a more involved $\mathcal{O}(\log n/\log \log n)$-approximation. We show how to solve the problem exactly on rooted instances, in which all demand arises at the same source. For paths, we prove strong NP-hardness and outline a PTAS. Moreover, we show that computing an optimal solution is in FPT or XP for several natural problem parameters.</description>
