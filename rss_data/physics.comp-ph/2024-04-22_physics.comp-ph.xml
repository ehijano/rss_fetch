      <title>A Generalized Expression for Accelerating Beamlet Decomposition Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paraxial diffraction modeling based on the Fourier transform has seen widespread implementation for simulating the response of a diffraction-limited optical system. For systems where the paraxial assumption is not sufficient, a class of algorithms has been developed that employs hybrid propagation physics to compute the propagation of an elementary beamlet along geometric ray paths. These "beamlet decomposition" algorithms include the well-known Gaussian Beamlet Decomposition (GBD) algorithm, of which several variants have been created. To increase the computational efficiency of the GBD algorithm, we derive an alternative expression of the technique that utilizes the analytical propagation of beamlets to tilted planes. We then use this accelerated algorithm to conduct a parameter-space search to find the optimal combination of free parameters in GBD to construct the analytical Airy function. The experiment is conducted on a consumer-grade CPU, and a high-performance GPU, where the new algorithm is 34 times faster than the previously published algorithm on CPUs, and 67,513 times faster on GPUs.</description>

      <title>Simple and efficient methods for local structural analysis in polydisperse hard disk systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nonequilibrium statistical physics, quantifying the nearest (and higher-order) neighbors and free volumes of particles in many-body systems is crucial to elucidating the origin of macroscopic collective phenomena, such as glass/granular jamming transitions and various aspects of the behavior of active matter. However, conventional techniques (based on a fixed-distance cutoff or the Voronoi construction) have mainly been applied to equilibrated, homogeneous, and monodisperse particle systems. In this paper, we implement simple and efficient methods for local structure analysis in nonequilibrium, inhomogeneous, and polydisperse hard disk systems. We show how these novel methods can overcome the difficulties encountered by conventional techniques, as well as demonstrating some applications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Limits of Charge Carrier Mobilities in Layered Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered halide perovskites have emerged as potential alternatives to three-dimensional halide perovskites due to their improved stability and larger material phase space, allowing fine-tuning of structural, electronic, and optical properties. However, their charge carrier mobilities are significantly smaller than that of three-dimensional halide perovskites, which has a considerable impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio approaches to unveil the electron-phonon mechanisms responsible for the diminished transport properties of layered halide perovskites. Starting from a prototypical ABX$_{3}$ halide perovskite, we model the case of $n=1$ and $n=2$ layered structures and compare their electronic and transport properties to the three-dimensional reference. The electronic and phononic properties are investigated within density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), while transport properties are obtained via the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The vibrational modes contributing to charge carrier scattering are investigated and associated with polar-phonon scattering mechanisms arising from the long-range Fr\"ohlich coupling and deformation potential scattering processes. Our investigation reveals that the lower mobilities in layered systems primarily originates from the increased electronic density of states at the vicinity of the band edges, while the electron-phonon coupling strength remains similar. Such increase is caused by the dimensionality reduction and the break in octahedra connectivity along the stacking direction. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms in layered perovskites and highlight the intrinsic limitations of the charge carrier transport in these materials.</description>

      <title>A note on higher-order and nonlinear limiting approaches for continuously bounds-preserving discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In (Dzanic, J. Comp. Phys., 508:113010, 2024), a limiting approach for high-order discontinuous Galerkin schemes was introduced which allowed for imposing constraints on the solution continuously (i.e., everywhere within the element). While exact for linear constraint functionals, this approach only imposed a sufficient (but not the minimum necessary) amount of limiting for nonlinear constraint functionals. This short note shows how this limiting approach can be extended to allow exactness for general nonlinear quasiconcave constraint functionals through a nonlinear limiting procedure, reducing unnecessary numerical dissipation. Some examples are shown for nonlinear pressure and entropy constraints in the compressible gas dynamics equations, where both analytic and iterative approaches are used.</description>

      <title>A high-fidelity finite volume scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations using boundary variation diminishing algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-fidelity finite volume scheme based on the BVD (boundary variation diminishing) concept is proposed in this study to solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. A hybrid spatial reconstruction profile, consisting of a quadratic polynomial and a steepness-adjustable hyperbolic tangent function, is adopted to reproduce the accurate solutions of the complex magnetohydrodynamics flows. The BVD principle is used to find a optimal combination of these two types of spatial reconstructions by comparing the variations of the interface values interpolated in two adjacent cells, aiming to remove the non-physical oscillations around discontinuities by switching the quadratic polynomial to a step-shaped function. Additionally, a constrained transport (CT) method is applied in this study to assure the non-divergent solution of the magnetic field. The widely used numerical tests in one and two dimensional cases were checked in this study. The numerical results can retrieve the accuracy of a $3^{rd}$-order linear scheme in the convergence test for both advection and MHD equations and capture the strong shock waves in MHD flows without spurious oscillations. In comparison with the results of a $3^{rd}$-order WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory) scheme, the proposed scheme gains more accurate solutions not only for the strong discontinuities but also the smooth structures across scales. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to build a high-fidelity model for ideal MHD equations by a BVD algorithm. Numerical results are competitive to those of existing advanced models and thus the BVD algorithm has promising potentials to build practical models for various MHD flows.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation Induced Non-monotonic Height Change and Microphase Separation of Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>
