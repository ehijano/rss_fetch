      <title>Shrinking shrimp-shaped domains and multistability in the dissipative asymmetric kicked rotor map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interesting feature in dissipative nonlinear systems is the emergence of characteristic domains in parameter space that exhibit periodic temporal evolution, known as shrimp-shaped domains. We investigate the parameter space of the dissipative asymmetric kicked rotor map and show that, in the regime of strong dissipation, the shrimp-shaped domains repeat themselves as the nonlinearity parameter increases while maintaining the same period. We analyze the dependence of the length of each periodic domain with the nonlinearity parameter, revealing that it follows a power law with the same exponent regardless of the dissipation parameter. Additionally, we find that the distance between adjacent shrimp-shaped domains is scaling invariant with respect to the dissipation parameter. Furthermore, we show that for weaker dissipation, a multistable scenario emerges within the periodic domains. We find that as the dissipation gets weaker, the ratio of multistable parameters for each periodic domain increases, and the area of the periodic basin decreases as the nonlinearity parameter increases.</description>

      <title>Early warnings are too late when parameters change rapidly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early warning signals (EWSs) forewarn a sudden transition (or tipping) from a desirable state to an undesirable state. However, we observe that EWSs detect an impending tipping past bifurcation points when control parameters are varied fast; this questions the applicability of EWSs in real-world systems. When a control parameter is changed at a finite rate, the tipping is also delayed, providing a borrowed stability (in the parameter space) before the system tips. In this study, we use the Hurst exponent as EWS in a thermoacoustic system - a horizontal Rijke tube. We find that upon receiving an EWS alert, a quick reversal of the control parameter within the region of borrowed stability cannot always prevent tipping in real-world systems. We show this failure is due to the (i) delay in receiving the EWS alert and (ii) dispersion observed in the warning points received. For fast variation of parameters, where preventive measures fall short, we demonstrate EWS-based control actions to rescue the system after tipping. Our results in a real-world system for a fast variation of parameter highlight the limits of applicability of EWSs in preventing tipping.</description>

      <title>Unstable Limit Cycles Estimation from Small Perturbations: A Model-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although stable solutions of dynamical systems are typically considered more important than unstable ones, unstable solutions have a critical role in the dynamical integrity of stable solutions. In fact, usually, basins of attraction boundaries are composed of unstable solutions and their stable manifolds. This study proposes a method for estimating unstable limit cycles surrounding stable equilibrium points. The method exploits the shape of the decrement of trajectories converging towards the equilibrium. For the method, trajectories obtained from small perturbations from the equilibrium state are sufficient to estimate the unstable limit cycle roughly. No mathematical model of the system dynamics is needed for the computation, which requires only a single trajectory in the phase space. As such, the method is computationally very rapid and potentially implementable in real structures.</description>

      <title>Coupling Between Local and Global Oscillations in Palladium-Catalysed Methane Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between order and disorder is crucial across various fields, especially in understanding oscillatory phenomena. Periodic oscillations are frequently observed in heterogeneous catalysis, yet their underlying mechanisms need deeper exploration. Here, we investigate how periodic oscillations arise during methane oxidation catalysed by palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs), utilizing a suite of complementary operando techniques across various spatial scales. We found that reaction intensity and collective dynamic modes can be tuned by the reactant gas-flow rate. At lower gas-flow rates, we observed periodic facet reconstruction of Pd NPs correlated with repeated bubbling behaviour at the Pd/PdO interface, without evident global oscillatory responses. Conversely, at higher gas-flow rates, Pd NPs undergo chaotic transformations between metallic and oxidized states, resulting in overall oscillation. Integrating our observations at different gas-flow rates, we attributed the emergence of global oscillation to thermal coupling regulated by gas flow and connected local and global dynamics through a weak synchronization mechanism. This work demonstrates the correlations between open surfaces and interfaces, chaos and regularity, and dissipative processes and coupling behaviour. Our findings offer critical insights into the complexity behind catalytic oscillations and provide guidance for modulating oscillatory behaviours in catalytic processes, with significant implications for both science and industry.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Distance-Based Stability Quantifier for Complex Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An attractor of a dynamical system may represent the system's 'desirable' state. Perturbations to the system may push the system out of the basin of attraction of the desirable attractor and into undesirable states. Hence, it is important to quantify the stability of such systems against reasonably large perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a distance-based measure of stability, called 'basin stability bound', to characterise the stability of dynamical systems against finite perturbations. This stability measure depends on both the size and the shape of the basin of attraction of the desirable attractor. A probabilistic sampling-based approach is used to estimate basin stability bound and quantify the associated estimation error. This approach allows for the easy estimation of basin stability bound regardless of the structure of the basin of attraction and is readily applicable to high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate the merit of the proposed stability measure using an ecological model of the Amazon rainforest, a ship capsize model, and a power grid model.</description>

      <title>Ratchet current and scaling properties in a nontwist mapping</title>

Abstract: We investigate the transport of particles in the chaotic component of phase space for a two-dimensional, area-preserving nontwist map. The survival probability for particles within the chaotic sea is described by an exponential decay for regions in phase space predominantly chaotic and it is scaling invariant in this case. Alternatively, when considering mixed chaotic and regular regions, there is a deviation from the exponential decay, characterized by a power law tail for long times, a signature of the stickiness effect. Furthermore, due to the asymmetry of the chaotic component of phase space with respect to the line $I = 0$, there is an unbalanced stickiness which generates a ratchet current in phase space. Finally, we perform a phenomenological description of the diffusion of chaotic particles by identifying three scaling hypotheses, and obtaining the critical exponents via extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Restrictions on realizable unitary operations imposed by symmetry and locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.05524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to a fundamental result in quantum computing, any unitary transformation on a composite system can be generated using so-called 2-local unitaries that act only on two subsystems. Beyond its importance in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can experience after a sufficiently long time. Here we show that this universality does not remain valid in the presence of conservation laws and global continuous symmetries such as U(1) and SU(2). In particular, we show that generic symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented, even approximately, using local symmetric unitaries. Based on this no-go theorem, we propose a method for experimentally probing the locality of interactions in nature. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, our results mean that generic energy-conserving unitary transformations on a composite system cannot be realized solely by combining local energy-conserving unitaries on the components. We show how this can be circumvented via catalysis.</description>

      <title>Complexity of chaotic optical frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a single-mode semiconductor laser induced by the optical injection of a frequency comb are analyzed through the lens of complexity. In particular, the focus is dynamics outside the injection-locking region. Permutation entropy (P.E.) and chaos bandwidth (CBW) are used to quantify complexity. Various numerically simulated system outputs across the frequency detuning range and for different injection strengths are considered. Numerically simulated outputs from a single-mode injection system in the absence of comb injection are compared to comment on the origin of the reported complexity. Furthermore, experimental outputs are used to confirm the findings. Despite the presence of periodic dynamics originating from the frequency comb, the presented system generates remarkably high complex outputs with P.E. up to 0.99 maintained over an extended period of observation and long timescales with CBW up to 25 GHz.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Intermittency in Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results suggest that highly active, chaotic, non-equilibrium states of living fluids might share much in common with high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We now show, by using a hydrodynamical model, the onset of intermittency and the consequent multiscaling of Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions as a function of the bacterial activity. Our results bridge the worlds of low and high Reynolds number flows as well as open up intriguing possibilities of what makes flows intermittent.</description>
