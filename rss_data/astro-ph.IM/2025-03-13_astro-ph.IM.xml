      <title>Integrating UX Design in Astronomical Software Development: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, ASTRON took the step of incorporating a dedicated User Experience (UX) designer into its software development process. This decision aimed to enhance the accessibility and usability of services providing access to the data holdings from the telescopes we are developing.
  The field of astronomical software development has historically under emphasized UX design. ASTRON's initiative not only improves our own tools, but can also be used to demonstrate to the broader community the value of integrating UX expertise into development teams.
  We discuss how we integrate the UX designer at the start of our software development lifecycle. We end with providing some considerations on how other projects could make use of UX knowledge in their development process.</description>

      <title>The CONDOR Observatory: A Gamma-Ray Observatory with a 100 GeV Threshold at 5300 Meters Above Sea Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of the Compact Network of Detectors with Orbital Range (CONDOR), a proposed high-altitude gamma-ray and cosmic-ray (CR) observatory set to become the highest of its kind. Planned for installation at Cerro Toco in the Atacama Desert, Chile, at 5300 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.), CONDOR is optimized to operate in the 100 GeV to 1 TeV range using the extensive air-shower technique. The design prioritizes simplicity, modularity, and robustness to ensure reliable performance in a harsh environment. The CONDOR array has a full coverage factor of 90 and consists of 6000 plastic scintillator panels, each approximately 1 m^2, read by wavelength-shifting fibers and SiPMs. The readout electronics are based on fast ADCs, with White Rabbit technology ensuring time synchronization. We present an analysis of angular resolution and effective area by variation of the CORSIKA design to meet the developing GeV threshold, complementing other ground-based observatories in gamma-ray and proton CR measurements. CONDOR has the potential to support an extensive research program in astroparticle physics and multimessenger astronomy from the Southern Hemisphere, operating in all-sky mode 24 hours per day, year-round, with satellite data ranges.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectral fitting with Monte Carlo Dropout Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach using neural networks to recover X-ray spectral model parameters and quantify uncertainties, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency against traditional frequentist and Bayesian methods. Frequentist techniques often fall into local minima, compromising parameter estimation, while Bayesian methods, though more reliable, suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, we apply Monte Carlo Dropout within various neural network architectures trained on simulated spectra generated from a multiparameter emission model convolved with an instrument response. The model parameters are sampled from a predefined prior, and our proof of concept is illustrated using simulated data based on the NICER response matrix for simple emission models with up to five parameters. Our method delivers well-defined posterior distributions comparable to Bayesian inference, achieves accuracy akin to conventional spectral fitting, and is significantly less prone to local minima, thereby reducing the risk of selecting parameter outliers. Moreover, the approach improves computational speed by roughly an order of magnitude compared to traditional Bayesian techniques. This work demonstrates the potential of neural network-based methods as a robust alternative for X-ray spectral analysis, particularly in the context of future astronomical missions expected to generate extensive datasets.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of the first telescope with a toroidal curved detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a practical implementation of the anamorphically curved detector concept. In order to demonstrate its advantages, a telescope lab prototype was developed, built, and tested. It is based on a 4-mirror all-spherical unobscured design, similar to that proposed by D. Shafer. The telescope is open at F/#=5.5 and its extended field of view is 10.6x8 degrees. We explore the design parameter space to demonstrate the change in gain introduced by the curved detector and to substantiate the chosen parameters. If the image surface is curved to the shape of a toroid, the image quality reaches the diffraction limit over the entire field by design. The design was optimized to use standard concave spherical mirrors. The detector was curved down toroidally with an exquisite surface precision of approximately 11 micrometers Peak-to-Valley. The experimental tests of the prototype have shown that use of the toroidally curved detector allows to increase the contrast in the field corner by up to 0.3 units, which is in good agreement with the modeling results. We also propose a few prospective applications of the demonstrated concept.</description>

      <title>The Molecular Cloud Lifecycle I: Constraining H2 formation and dissociation rates with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06416v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular clouds (MCs) are the birthplaces of new stars in galaxies. A key component of MCs are photodissociation regions (PDRs), where far-ultraviolet radiation plays a crucial role in determining the gas's physical and chemical state. Traditional PDR models assume chemical steady state (CSS), where the rates of H$_2$ formation and photodissociation are balanced. However, real MCs are dynamic and can be out of CSS. In this study, we demonstrate that combining H$_2$ emission lines observed in the far-ultraviolet or infrared with column density observations can be used to derive the rates of H$_2$ formation and photodissociation. We derive analytical formulae that relate these rates to observable quantities, which we validate using synthetic H$_2$ line emission maps derived from the SILCC-Zoom hydrodynamical simulation. Our method estimates integrated H$_2$ formation and dissociation rates with an accuracy $\approx 30$ % (on top of uncertainties in observed H$_2$ emission maps and column densities). Our simulations, valid for column densities $N \leq 2 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, cover a wide dynamic range in H$_2$ formation and photodissociation rates, showing significant deviations from CSS, with 74 % of the MC's mass deviating from CSS by a factor greater than 2. Our analytical formulae can effectively distinguish between regions in and out of CSS. When applied to actual H$_2$ line observations, our method can assess the chemical state of MCs, providing insights into their evolutionary stages and lifetimes. A NASA Small Explorer mission concept, Eos, will be proposed in 2025 and is specifically designed to conduct the types of observations outlined in this study.</description>

      <title>Southern binaries with the Zorro Speckle Camera @ Gemini-South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements in the context of a survey of southern hemisphere binary and multiple stellar systems observed with the Zorro Speckle dual diffraction-limited optical imaging camera on the 8.1m Gemini-South telescope carried out between 2019 and 2023. The overall motivation of our survey, as well as some initial results of these observations, are outlined to demonstrate the capabilities - and limitations - of Zorro. We report on the astrometric characterization of the instrument in terms of the precision and accuracy of our measurements and provide details of our custom-made data reduction pipeline. For targets with separations smaller than 0.4 arcsec, an overall precision of 1 mas in the radial and tangential directions is obtained, while the uncertainty in position angle is 0.2 deg. Relative astrometry and contrast brightness in the two Zorro filters at 562 and 832 nm are reported for 70 pairs on 64 distinct systems (six are triples). Eleven new binaries are found, mostly of small separations (down to 15 mas), and large brightness contrast (up to Delta m=6 in the red channel). Our results indicate that the Zorro instrument, when properly calibrated, delivers excellent quality data for visual binary studies of tight and/or faint companions.</description>

      <title>Survey-Wide Asteroid Discovery with a High-Performance Computing Enabled Non-Linear Digital Tracking Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys detect asteroids by linking together their appearances across multiple images taken over time. This approach faces limitations in detecting faint asteroids and handling the computational complexity of trajectory linking. We present a novel method that adapts ``digital tracking" - traditionally used for short-term linear asteroid motion across images - to work with large-scale synoptic surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Rubin/LSST). Our approach combines hundreds of sparse observations of individual asteroids across their non-linear orbital paths to enhance detection sensitivity by several magnitudes. To address the computational challenges of processing massive data sets and dense orbital phase spaces, we developed a specialized high-performance computing architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments that take advantage of the extensive computational resources at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This work enables the detection of significantly fainter asteroids in existing and future survey data, potentially increasing the observable asteroid population by orders of magnitude across different orbital families, from near-Earth objects (NEOs) to Kuiper belt objects (KBOs).</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Backgrounds in Solid-State Phonon and Charge Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state phonon and charge detectors probe the scattering of weakly interacting particles, such as dark matter and neutrinos, through their low recoil thresholds. Recent advancements have pushed sensitivity to eV-scale energy depositions, uncovering previously-unseen low-energy excess backgrounds. While some arise from known processes such as thermal radiation, luminescence, and stress, others remain unexplained. This review examines these backgrounds, their possible origins, and parallels to low-energy effects in solids. Their understanding is essential for interpreting particle interactions at and below the eV-scale.</description>

      <title>Probing 2D Asymmetries of an Exoplanet Atmosphere from Chromatic Transit Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method for investigating atmospheric inhomogeneities in exoplanets through transmission spectroscopy. Our approach links chromatic variations in conventional transit model parameters (central transit time, total and full durations, and transit depth) to atmospheric asymmetries. By separately analyzing atmospheric asymmetries during ingress and egress, we can derive clear connections between these variations and the underlying asymmetries of the planetary limbs. Additionally, this approach enables us to investigate differences between the limbs slightly offset from the terminator on the dayside and the nightside. We applied this method to JWST's NIRSpec/G395H observations of the hot Saturn exoplanet WASP-39 b. Our analysis suggests a higher abundance of CO2 on the evening limb compared to the morning limb and indicates a greater probability of SO2 on the limb slightly offset from the terminator on the dayside relative to the nightside. These findings highlight the potential of our method to enhance the understanding of photochemical processes in exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Using Co-Located Range and Doppler Radars for Initial Orbit Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With debris larger than 1 cm in size estimated to be over one million, precise cataloging efforts are essential to ensure space operations' safety. Compounding this challenge is the oversubscribed problem, where the sheer volume of space objects surpasses ground-based observatories' observational capacity. This results in sparse, brief observations and extended intervals before image acquisition. LeoLabs' network of phased-array radars addresses this need by reliably tracking 10 cm objects and larger in low Earth orbit with 10 independent radars across six sites. While LeoLabs tracklets are extremely short, they hold much more information than typical radar observations. Furthermore, two tracklets are generally available, separated by a couple of minutes. Thus, this paper develops a tailored approach to initialize state and uncertainty from a single or pair of tracklets. Through differential algebra, the initial orbit determination provides the state space compatible with the available measurements, namely an orbit set. This practice, widely used in previous research, allows for efficient data association of different tracklets, thus enabling the addition of accurate tracks to the catalog following their independent initialization. The algorithm's efficacy is tested using real measurements, evaluating the IOD solution's accuracy and ability to predict the next passage from a single or a pair of tracklets.</description>

      <title>The role of Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFG) in the formation of the solar supergranular pattern from Hinode observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present in this paper an exceptional scientific dataset allowing to investigate the structure and evolution of the interior of solar supergranulation cells. Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFG) and associated flows were evidenced using Local Correlation Tracking techniques (LCT) from a 24 H duration sequence of Hinode (JAXA/NASA) observations. The treatment of the dataset exhibits the evolution of the TFG and shows that their mutual interactions are able to build horizontal flows with longer lifetime than granules (1 to 2 hours) over a scale of 10 arcsec (the mesogranulation). These flows act on the diffusion of the intranetwork magnetic elements and also on the location and shape of the network. Hence, the TFG appear as one of the major elements involved in supergranular formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Exploring symbolic regression and genetic algorithms for astronomical object classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of symbolic regression (SR) combined with genetic algorithms (GA) to classify astronomical objects. Using the SDSS17 dataset from Kaggle, which includes 100,000 observations of stars, galaxies, and quasars, we applied SR to 10\% of the data to derive a mathematical expression capable of distinguishing these classes. A genetic algorithm was then employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the expression, refining the model's performance. The final model achieved a Cohen's kappa value of 0.81, indicating a strong agreement with true classifications. Our results demonstrate that the SR+GA approach can produce interpretable and accurate models for the classification of astronomical objects, offering a promising alternative to traditional black-box machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Stellar Parameters for over Fifty Million stars from SMSS DR4 and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature, luminosity classification, and metallicity, for over fifty million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) DR4 and Gaia DR3. The accuracy of the derived parameters remains consistent with those achieved in SMSS DR2 using the same methods. Thanks to the advancements in SMSS DR4, photometric-metallicity estimates are now available for an unprecedented number of metal-poor stars. The catalog includes over 13 million metal-poor (MP; [Fe/H]&lt;-1) stars, nearly three million very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H]&lt;-2.0) stars, and approximately 120,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H]&lt;-3.0) stars -- representing an increase by a factor of 4-6 compared to SMSS DR2. This catalog, combined with other stellar parameters obtained through our efforts, will be made available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/data/sports/.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Modeling of Polarized Atmosphere at the South Pole with SPT-3G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the detection and characterization of fluctuations in linearly polarized emission from the atmosphere above the South Pole. These measurements make use of data from the SPT-3G receiver on the South Pole Telescope in three frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. We use the cross-correlation between detectors to produce an unbiased estimate of the power in Stokes I, Q, and U parameters on large angular scales. Our results are consistent with the polarized signal being produced by the combination of Rayleigh scattering of thermal radiation from the ground and thermal emission from a population of horizontally aligned ice crystals with an anisotropic distribution described by Kolmogorov turbulence. The measured spatial scaling, frequency scaling, and elevation dependence of the polarized emission are explained by this model. Polarized atmospheric emission has the potential to significantly impact observations on the large angular scales being targeted by searches for inflationary B-mode CMB polarization. We present the distribution of measured angular power spectrum amplitudes in Stokes Q and I for 4 yr of Austral winter observations, which can be used to simulate the impact of atmospheric polarization and intensity fluctuations at the South Pole on a specified experiment and observation strategy. We present a mitigation strategy that involves both downweighting significantly contaminated observations and subtracting a polarized atmospheric signal from the 150 GHz band maps. In observations with the SPT-3G instrument, the polarized atmospheric signal is a well-understood and subdominant contribution to the measured noise after implementing the mitigation strategies described here.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Active Learning for optimised spectroscopic follow-up: Enhancing early SN Ia classification with the Fink broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current and future surveys rely on machine learning classification to obtain large and complete samples of transients. Many of these algorithms are restricted by training samples that contain a limited number of spectroscopically confirmed events. Here, we present the first real-time application of Active Learning to optimise spectroscopic follow-up with the goal of improving training sets of early type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) classifiers. Using a photometric classifier for early SN Ia, we apply an Active Learning strategy for follow-up optimisation using the real-time FINK broker processing of the ZTF public stream. We perform follow-up observations at the ANU 2.3m telescope in Australia and obtain 92 spectroscopic classified events that are incorporated in our training set. We show that our follow-up strategy yields a training set that, with 25% less spectra, improves classification metrics when compared to publicly reported spectra. Our strategy selects in average fainter events and, not only supernovae types, but also microlensing events and flaring stars which are usually not incorporated on training sets. Our results confirm the effectiveness of active learning strategies to construct optimal training samples for astronomical classifiers. With the Rubin Observatory LSST soon online, we propose improvements to obtain earlier candidates and optimise follow-up. This work paves the way to the deployment of real-time AL follow-up strategies in the era of large surveys.</description>

      <title>FANSIC: a Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit for the readout of large silicon photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM) have been replacing traditional photomultiplier tubes in most light sensing applications. However, when large detection surface coverage is needed, photomultipliers (PMTs) are still the preferred choice. The main reasons are the sensor thermal noise and the duration of the fast component of its signal, both increasing with the sensor surface. In this work we propose an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), called Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit (FANSIC), for the readout of large SiPMs addressing these limitations. The ASIC has an active summation stage, which allows to divide a large detection surface into smaller ones offering faster response both in single ended and differential outputs. The high input bandwidth allows to reach full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) signals or the order of 3--5 ns which limits the impact of internal and external uncorrelated noise. The results of the first implementation of FANSIC, designed in CMOS 65 nm technology, is described in this paper.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Data Calibration with Transformer Model Using Physical Constraints: A Scalable Method for Satellite Missions, Illustrated by Tianwen-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell's equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.</description>
