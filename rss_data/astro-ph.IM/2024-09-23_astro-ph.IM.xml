      <title>Detailed Analysis of Local Climate at the CTAO-North Site on La Palma from 20 Years of MAGIC Weather Station Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos will host the northern site of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), in an area about 200 m below the mountain rim, where the optical telescopes are located. The site currently hosts the MAGIC Telescopes, which have gathered a unique series of 20 years of weather data. We use advanced profile likelihood methods to determine seasonal cycles, the occurrence of weather extremes, weather downtime, and long-term trends correctly taking into account data gaps. The fractality of the weather data is investigated by means of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. The data are published according to the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles. We find that the behaviour of wind and relative humidity show significant differences compared to the mountain rim. We observe an increase in temperature of $0.55\pm0.07\mathrm{(stat.)}\pm0.07\mathrm{(syst.)}^\circ C$/decade, the diurnal temperature range of $0.13\pm0.04\mathrm{(stat.)}\pm0.02\mathrm{(syst.)}^\circ C$/decade (accompanied by an increase of seasonal oscillation amplitude of $\Delta C_m=0.29\pm0.10\mathrm{(stat.)}\pm0.04\mathrm{(syst.)}^\circ C$/decade) and relative humidity of $4.0\pm0.4\mathrm{(stat.)}\pm1.1\mathrm{(syst.)}$%/decade, and a decrease in trade wind speeds of $0.85\pm0.12\mathrm{(stat.)}\pm0.07\mathrm{(syst.)}$(km/h)/decade. The occurrence of extreme weather, such as tropical storms and long rains, remains constant over time. We find a significant correlation of temperature with the North Atlantic Oscillation Index and multifractal behaviour of the data. The site shows a weather-related downtime of 18.5%-20.5%, depending on the wind gust limits employed. No hints are found of a degradation of weather downtime under the assumption of a linear evolution of environmental parameters over time.</description>

      <title>GWPopulation: Hardware agnostic population inference for compact binaries and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO--Virgo collaboration in 2015, the size of the gravitational-wave transient catalog has grown to nearly 100 events, with more than as many observed during the ongoing fourth observing run. Extracting astrophysical/cosmological information from these observations is a hierarchical Bayesian inference problem. GWPopulation is designed to provide simple-to-use, robust, and extensible tools for hierarchical inference in gravitational-wave astronomy/cosmology. It has been widely adopted for gravitational-wave astronomy, including producing flagship results for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. While designed to work with observations of compact binary coalescences, GWPopulation may be available to a wider range of hierarchical Bayesian inference problems.</description>

      <title>$Mesiri$:Mephisto Early Supernovae Ia Rapid Identifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early time observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a crucial role in investigating and resolving longstanding questions about progenitor stars and the explosion mechanisms of these events. Colors of supernovae (SNe) in the initial days after the explosion can help differentiate between different types of SNe. However, the use of true color information to identify SNe Ia at the early-time explosion is still in its infancy. The Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) is a photometric survey telescope equipped with three CCD cameras, capable of simultaneously imaging the same patch of sky in three bands (\emph{u, g, i} or \emph{v, r, z}), yielding real-time colors of astronomical objects. In this paper, we introduce a new time-series classification tool named Mephisto Early Supernovae Ia Rapid Identifier (\emph{\texttt{Mesiri}}), which for the first time, utilizes real-time color information to distinguish early-time SNe Ia from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). \emph{\texttt{Mesiri}} is based on the deep learning approach and can achieve an accuracy of $96.75\pm0.79$\%, and AUC of $98.87\pm0.53$\% in case of single epoch random observation before the peak brightness. These values reach towards perfectness if additional data points on several night observations are considered. The classification with real-time color significantly outperforms that with pseudo-color, especially at the early time, i.e., with only a few points of observations. The architecture of BiLSTM shows the best performance than the others that have been tested in this work.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Multi-band Galaxy Observations with Large Language Model-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical research traditionally relies on extensive domain knowledge to interpret observations and narrow down hypotheses. We demonstrate that this process can be emulated using large language model-based agents to accelerate research workflows. We propose mephisto, a multi-agent collaboration framework that mimics human reasoning to interpret multi-band galaxy observations. mephisto interacts with the CIGALE codebase, which includes spectral energy distribution (SED) models to explain observations. In this open-world setting, mephisto learns from its self-play experience, performs tree search, and accumulates knowledge in a dynamically updated base. As a proof of concept, we apply mephisto to the latest data from the James Webb Space Telescope. mephisto attains near-human proficiency in reasoning about galaxies' physical scenarios, even when dealing with a recently discovered population of "Little Red Dot" galaxies. This represents the first demonstration of agentic research in astronomy, advancing towards end-to-end research via LLM agents and potentially expediting astronomical discoveries.</description>

      <title>Design and development of the HERMES Pathfinder payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HERMES (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites) Pathfinder mission aims to observe and localize Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) and other transients using a constellation of nanosatellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Scheduled for launch in early 2025, the 3U CubeSats will host miniaturized instruments featuring a hybrid Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) and GAGG:Ce scintillator photodetector system, sensitive to X-rays and gamma-rays across a wide energy range. Each HERMES payload contains 120 SDD cells, each with a sensitive area of 45 mm^2, organized into 12 matrices, reading out 60 12.1x6.94x15.0 mm^3 GAGG:Ce scintillators. Photons interacting with an SDD are identified as X-ray events (2-60 keV), while photons in the 20-2000 keV range absorbed by the crystals produce scintillation light, which is read by two SDDs, allowing event discrimination. The detector system, including front-end and back-end electronics, a power supply unit, a chip-scale atomic clock, and a payload data handling unit, fits within a 10x10x10 cm^3 volume, weighs 1.5 kg, and has a maximum power consumption of about 2 W. This paper outlines the development of the HERMES constellation, the design and selection of the payload detectors, and laboratory testing, presenting the results of detector calibrations and environmental tests to provide a comprehensive status update of the mission.</description>

      <title>Bayesian forecasting with information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting techniques for assessing the power of future experiments to discriminate between theories or discover new laws of nature are of great interest in many areas of science. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian forecasting method using information theory. We argue that mutual information is a suitable quantity to study in this context. Besides being Bayesian, this proposal has the advantage of not relying on the choice of fiducial parameters, describing the "true" theory (which is a priori unknown), and is applicable to any probability distribution. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for parameter estimation and model selection, both of which are of interest concerning future experiments. We argue that mutual information has plausible interpretation in both situations. In addition, we state a number of propositions that offer information-theoretic meaning to some of the Bayesian practices such as performing multiple experiments, combining different datasets, and marginalization.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Number of Radio Sources Seen by Both VLASS and LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio surveys typically sample extragalactic sources in higher redshift regimes than is typical for optical surveys, resulting in many radio sources not having a detected optical counterpart. Over the next decade the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will be performing the deepest ($i &lt; 26.4\,$mag) wide-area optical survey to date increasing the fraction of radio sources for which we have optical data. In this Research Note we use the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey to analyse how the fraction of radio sources in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) with optical detections varies as a function of $i$-band magnitude and extrapolate to predict the number of optical counterparts we expect LSST to detect. Assuming a final VLASS point source depth of $S_{3\,\text{GHz}}\lesssim350\,\mu$Jy, we expect LSST to identify optical counterparts to $\sim 10^6$ radio sources in VLASS.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-3D visualization of Faraday structure in polarized radio sources: methods, science use cases, and development priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the construction of polarized intensity cubes $P$(RA, Dec, $\Phi$) and their visualization as movies, as a powerful technique for interpreting Faraday structure. $P$ is constructed from maps of peak polarized intensity P(RA, Dec) with their corresponding Faraday depth maps $\Phi$(RA, Dec). We illustrate the extensive scientific potential of such visualizations with a variety of science use cases from ASKAP and MeerKAT, presenting models that are consistent with the data but not necessarily unique. We demonstrate how one can, in principle, distinguish between cube structures which originate from unrelated foreground screens from those due to magnetized plasmas local to the emitting source. Other science use cases illustrate how variations in the local $n_e$ $B$, and line-of-sight distance to the synchrotron emitting regions can be distinguished using Faraday rotation. We show, for the first time, how the line-of-sight orientation of AGN jets can be determined. We also examine the case of M87 to show how internal jet magnetic field configurations can be identified, and extend earlier results. We recommend using this technique to re-evaluate all previous analyses of polarized sources that are well-resolved both spatially and in Faraday depth. Recognizing the subjective nature of interpretations at this early stage, we also highlight the need and utility for further scientific and technical developments.</description>

      <title>Hall MHD waves: A fundamental departure from their MHD counterparts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is demonstrated through a succinct derivation as to how the linear waves in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) constitute a fundamental departure from the standard MHD waves. Apart from modifying the conventional MHD spectrum, the Hall current induces a distinct and new branch consisting of purely circularly polarized waves that may become the representative shear waves.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of X-point collapse in an extended magnetohydrodynamics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of X-point collapse in magnetic reconnection has witnessed extensive study in the context of space and laboratory plasmas. In this paper, a recently derived mathematical formulation of X-point collapse applicable in the regime of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) is shown to possess a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure composed of five dynamical variables inherited from its parent model. The Hamiltonian and the noncanonical Poisson bracket are both derived, and the latter is shown to obey the requisite properties of antisymmetry and the Jacobi identity (an explicit proof of the latter is provided). In addition, the governing equations for the Casimir invariants are presented, and one such solution is furnished. The above features can be harnessed and expanded in future work, such as developing symplectic integrators for this dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Accelerated parameter estimation of supermassive black hole binaries in LISA using meshfree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be capable of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the milli-Hertz band. Among various sources, LISA will detect the coalescence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Accurate and rapid inference of parameters for such sources will be important for potential electromagnetic follow-up efforts. Rapid Bayesian inference with LISA includes additional complexities as compared to current generation terrestrial detectors in terms of time and frequency dependent antenna response functions. In this work, we extend a recently developed, computationally efficient technique that uses meshfree interpolation methods to accelerate Bayesian reconstruction of compact binaries. Originally developed for second-generation terrestrial detectors, this technique is now adapted for LISA parameter estimation. Using the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown waveform (PhenomD) and assuming rigid adiabatic antenna response function, we show faithful inference of SMBHB parameters from GW signals embedded in stationary, Gaussian instrumental noise. We discuss the computational cost and performance of the meshfree approximation method in estimating the GW source parameters.</description>

      <title>Layout optimization and Performance of Large Array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (LACT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (LACT) is an array of 32 Cherenkov telescopes with 6-meter diameter mirrors to be constructed at the LHAASO site. In this work, we present a study on the layout optimization and performance analysis of LACT. We investigate two observation modes: large zenith angle observations for ultra-high energy events and small zenith angle observations for lower energy thresholds. For large zenith angles (60{\deg}), simulations show that an 8-telescope subarray can achieve an effective area of $3 ~\rm km^2$ and excellent angular resolution. For small zenith angles, we optimize the layout of 4-telescope cells and the full 32-telescope array. The threshold of the full array is about $200~\rm GeV$, which is particularly crucial for studying transient phenomena, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This study provides important guidance for the final LACT layout design and performance estimates under different observational conditions, demonstrating LACT's potential for deep observations of ultra-high energy \gray sources and morphological studies of PeVatrons, as well as time-domain \gray astronomy.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Techniques for Atmospheric Turbulence Removal: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of atmospheric turbulence on acquired imagery makes image interpretation and scene analysis extremely difficult and reduces the effectiveness of conventional approaches for classifying and tracking objects of interest in the scene. Restoring a scene distorted by atmospheric turbulence is also a challenging problem. The effect, which is caused by random, spatially varying perturbations, makes conventional model-based approaches difficult and, in most cases, impractical due to complexity and memory requirements. Deep learning approaches offer faster operation and are capable of implementation on small devices. This paper reviews the characteristics of atmospheric turbulence and its impact on acquired imagery. It compares the performance of various state-of-the-art deep neural networks, including Transformers, SWIN and Mamba, when used to mitigate spatio-temporal image distortions.</description>

This scheme relies on relaxation and splitting techniques and can be easily used at high order. A fully conservative version is not entropy satisfying but is observed experimentally to be more robust than standard constrained transport schemes at low plasma beta. At very low plasma beta and high Alfv\'en number, we have designed an entropy-satisfying version that is not conservative for the magnetic field but preserves admissible states and we switch locally a-priori between the two versions depending on the regime of plasma beta and Alfv\'en number. This strategy is robust in a wide range of standard MHD test cases, all performed at second order with a classic MUSCL-Hancock scheme.</description>

      <title>Combustion Toolbox: An open-source thermochemical code for gas- and condensed-phase problems involving chemical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Combustion Toolbox (CT) is a newly developed open-source thermochemical code designed to solve problems involving chemical equilibrium for both gas- and condensed-phase species. The kernel of the code is based on the theoretical framework set forth by NASA's computer program CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications) while incorporating new algorithms that significantly improve both convergence rate and robustness. The thermochemical properties are computed under the ideal gas approximation using an up-to-date version of NASA's 9-coefficient polynomial fits. These fits use the Third Millennium database, which includes the available values from Active Thermochemical Tables. Combustion Toolbox is programmed in MATLAB with an object-oriented architecture composed of three main modules: CT-EQUIL, CT-SD, and CT-ROCKET. The kernel module, CT-EQUIL, minimizes the Gibbs/Helmholtz free energy of the system using the technique of Lagrange multipliers combined with a multidimensional Newton-Raphson method, upon the condition that two state functions are used to define the mixture properties (e.g., enthalpy and pressure). CT-SD solves processes involving strong changes in dynamic pressure, such as steady shock and detonation waves under normal and oblique incidence angles. Finally, CT-ROCKET estimates rocket engine performance under highly idealized conditions. The new tool is equipped with a versatile Graphical User Interface and has been successfully used for teaching and research activities over the last four years. Results are in excellent agreement with CEA, Cantera within Caltech's Shock and Detonation Toolbox (SD-Toolbox), and the Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances (TEA) code. CT is available under an open-source GPLv3 license via GitHub https://github.com/CombustionToolbox/combustion_toolbox, and its documentation can be found in https://combustion-toolbox-website.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we will discuss the use of Machine Learning methods for the identification and localization of cometary activity for Solar System objects in ground and in space-based wide-field all-sky surveys. We will begin the chapter by discussing the challenges of identifying known and unknown active, extended Solar System objects in the presence of stellar-type sources and the application of classical pre-ML identification techniques and their limitations. We will then transition to the discussion of implementing ML techniques to address the challenge of extended object identification. We will finish with prospective future methods and the application to future surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>The Palomar twilight survey of 'Ayl\'o'chaxnim, Atiras, and comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-sun sky twilight observations allow for the detection of asteroid interior to the orbit of Venus (Aylos), the Earth (Atiras), and comets. We present the results of observations with the Palomar 48-inch telescope (P48)/Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera in 30 s r-band exposures taken during evening astronomical twilight from 2019 Sep 20 to 2022 March 7 and during morning astronomical twilight sky from 2019 Sep 21 to 2022 Sep 29. More than 46,000 exposures were taken in evening and morning astronomical twilight within 31 to 66 degrees from the Sun with an r-band limiting magnitude between 18.1 and 20.9. The twilight pointings show a slight seasonal dependence in limiting magnitude and ability to point closer towards the Sun, with limiting magnitude slightly improving during summer. In total, the one Aylo, (594913) 'Ayl\'o'chaxnim, and 4 Atiras, 2020 OV1, 2021 BS1, 2021 PB2, and 2021 VR3, were discovered in evening and morning twilight observations. Additional twilight survey discoveries also include 6 long-period comets: C/2020 T2, C/2020 V2, C/2021 D2, C/2021 E3, C/2022 E3, and C/2022 P3, and two short-period comets: P/2021 N1 and P/2022 P2 using deep learning comet detection pipelines. The P48/ZTF twilight survey also recovered 11 known Atiras, one Aylo, three short-period comes, two long-period comets, and one interstellar object. Lastly, the Vera Rubin Observatory will conduct a twilight survey starting in its first year of operations and will cover the sky within 45 degrees of the Sun. Twilight surveys such as those by ZTF and future surveys will provide opportunities for discovering asteroids inside the orbits of Earth and Venus.</description>

      <title>1-arcsecond imaging of ELAIS-N1 field at 144MHz using the LoTSS survey with international LOFAR telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first wide area (2.5 x 2.5 deg^2) LOFAR High Band Antenna image at a resolution of 1.2'' x 2'' with a median noise of approximately 80 microJy per beam. It was made from an 8-hour International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) observation of the ELAIS-N1 field at frequencies ranging from 120 to 168 MHz with the most up-to-date ILT imaging methods. This intermediate resolution falls between the highest possible resolution (0.3'') achievable by using all International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) baselines and the standard 6-arcsecond resolution in the LoTSS (LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey) image products utilising the LOFAR Dutch baselines only. This is the first demonstration of the feasibility of imaging using the ILT at a resolution of around 1'', which provides unique information on source morphology at scales that fall below the surface brightness limits at higher resolutions. The total calibration and imaging computational time is approximately 52,000 core hours, nearly 5 times more than required to produce a 6'' resolution image. We also present a radio source catalogue containing 2263 sources detected over the 2.5 x 2.5 deg^2 image of the ELAIS-N1 field, with a peak intensity threshold of 5.5 sigma. The catalogue has been cross-matched with the LoTSS deep ELAIS-N1 field radio catalogue, and its flux density and positional accuracy have been investigated and corrected accordingly. We find that approximately 80% of sources which we expect to be detectable based on their peak brightness in the LoTSS 6'' resolution image are detected in this image, which is approximately a factor of two higher than for 0.3'' resolution imaging in the Lockman Hole, implying there is a wealth of information on these intermediate scales.</description>

      <title>Polarization Leakage and the IXPE PSF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By measuring photoelectron tracks, the gas pixel detectors of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer satellite provide estimates of the photon detection location and its electric vector position angle (EVPA). However, imperfections in reconstructing event positions blur the image and EVPA-position correlations result in artificial polarized halos around bright sources. We introduce a new model describing this "polarization leakage" and use it to recover the on-orbit telescope point-spread functions, useful for faint source detection and image reconstruction. These point spread functions are more accurate than previous approximations or ground-calibrated products ($\Delta \chi^2\approx 3\times 10^{4}$ and $4 \times 10^4$ respectively for a bright $10^6$-count source). We also define an algorithm for polarization leakage correction substantially more accurate than existing prescriptions ($\Delta \chi^2\approx 1\times 10^{3}$). These corrections depend on the reconstruction method, and we supply prescriptions for the mission-standard "Moments" methods as well as for "Neural Net" event reconstruction. Finally, we present a method to isolate leakage contributions to polarization observations of extended sources and show that an accurate PSF allows the extraction of sub-PSF-scale polarization patterns.</description>

      <title>A millisecond pulsar position determined to 0.2 milliarcsecond precision with VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise millisecond pulsar (MSP) positions determined with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) hold the key to building the connection between the kinematic and dynamic reference frames respectively used by VLBI and pulsar timing. The frame connection would provide an important pathway to examining the planetary ephemerides used in pulsar timing, and potentially enhancing the sensitivities of pulsar timing arrays used to detect stochastic gravitational-wave background at nano-Hz regime. We aim at significantly improving the VLBI-based MSP position from its current $\gtrsim1\,$mas precision level by reducing the two dominant components in the positional uncertainty -- the propagation-related uncertainty and the uncertainty resulting from the frequency-dependent core shifts of the reference sources. We introduce a new differential astrometry strategy of using multiple calibrators observed at several widely separated frequencies, which we call PINPT (Phase-screen Interpolation plus frequeNcy-dePendent core shifT correction; read as "pinpoint") for brevity. The strategy allows determination of the core-shift and mitigates the impact of residual delay in the atmosphere. We implemented the strategy on PSR J2222-0137, an MSP well constrained astrometrically with VLBI and pulsar timing. Using the PINPT strategy, we determined core shifts for 4 AGNs around PSR J2222-0137, and derived a VLBI-based pulsar position with uncertainty of 0.17 mas and 0.32 mas in right ascension and declination, respectively, approaching the uncertainty level of the best-determined timing-based MSP positions. The realization of the PINPT strategy promises a factor-of-5 positional precision enhancement (over conventional VLBI astrometry) for all kinds of compact radio sources observed at $\lesssim2$ GHz, including most fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Tuning the MAPS Adaptive Secondary Mirror: Actuator Control, PID Tuning, Power Spectra and Failure Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MMT Adaptive optics exoPlanet characterization System (MAPS) is currently in its engineering phase, operating on-sky at the MMT Telescope on Mt. Hopkins in southern Arizona. The MAPS Adaptive Secondary Mirror's actuators are controlled by a closed loop modified PID control law and an open loop feed-forward law, which in combination allows for faster actuator response time. An essential element of achieving the secondary's performance goals involves the process of PID gain tuning. To start, we briefly discuss the design of the MAPS ASM and its actuators. We then describe the actuator positional control system and control law. Next, we discuss a few of the issues that make ASM tuning difficult. We then outline our initial attempts at tuning the actuator controllers and discuss the use of actuator positional power spectra for both tuning and determining the health and failure states of individual actuators. We conclude by presenting the results of our latest round of tuning configuration trials, which have been successful at decreasing mirror latency, increasing operational mirror modes and improving image PSF.</description>

      <title>Applying the Viterbi Algorithm to Planetary-Mass Black Hole Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for subsolar mass primordial black holes (PBHs) poses a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, extended signal duration, and computational cost demands, compared to solar mass binary black hole events. In this paper, we explore the possibility of investigating the mass range between subsolar and planetary masses, which is not accessible using standard matched filtering and continuous wave searches. We propose a systematic approach employing the Viterbi algorithm, a dynamic programming algorithm that identifies the most likely sequence of hidden Markov states given a sequence of observations, to detect signals from small mass PBH binaries. We formulate the methodology, provide the optimal length for short-time Fourier transforms, and estimate sensitivity. Subsequently, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Viterbi algorithm in identifying signals within mock data containing Gaussian noise. Our approach offers the primary advantage of being agnostic and computationally efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power spectrum, as a statistic in Fourier space, is commonly numerically calculated using the fast Fourier transform method to efficiently reduce the computational costs. To alleviate the systematic bias known as aliasing due to the insufficient sampling, the interlacing technique was proposed. We derive the analytical form of the shot noise under the interlacing technique, which enables the exact separation of the Poisson shot noise from the signal in this case. Thanks to the accurate shot noise subtraction, we demonstrate an enhancement in the accuracy of power spectrum estimation, and compare with the other widely used estimators in community. The good performance of our estimation allows an abatement in the computational cost by using low resolution and low order mass assignment scheme in the analysis for huge surveys and mocks.</description>

      <title>First studies on cascaded dual-phase liquid hole-multipliers in xenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Challenges in scaling up noble-liquid time projection chambers prompted the exploration of new detection concepts. The liquid hole-multiplier (LHM) was introduced as a potential component, enabling the detection of ionization electrons and VUV photons. Prior studies focused on perforated electrodes coated with CsI immersed in the liquid and electroluminescence amplification produced on a bubble trapped underneath. However, the performance was hindered by electron transfer across the liquid-gas interface. Here, we explored a bubble-free variant, placing a CsI-coated Thick Gas Electron Multiplier electrode below the liquid-gas interface to improve the transfer efficiency across it. Results show &gt;5-fold improvement in the S1'/S2 ratio (a proxy for the photon detection efficiency (PDE)) compared to the bubble-assisted LHM. Although the achieved PDE is still below expectation ($\sim$4%), we propose potential improvements to enhance the performance of this detector.</description>
