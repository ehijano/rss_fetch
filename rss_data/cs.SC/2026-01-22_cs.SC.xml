      <title>Certified Real Eigenvalue Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The location of real eigenvalues provides critical insights into the stability and resonance properties of physical systems. This paper presents a hybrid symbolic numeric approach for certified real eigenvalue localization. Our method combines Gershgorin disk analysis with Hermite matrix certification to compute certified intervals that enclose the real eigenvalues. These intervals can be further refined through bisectionlike procedures to achieve the desired precision. The proposed approach delivers reliable interval certifications while preserving computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a concise, fully worked computational example.</description>

      <title>Diagonals and algebraicity modulo $p$: a sharper degree bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1984, Deligne proved that for any prime number $p$, the reduction modulo $p$ of the diagonal of a multivariate algebraic power series with integer coefficients is algebraic over the field of rational functions with coefficients in $\mathbb F_p$. Moreover, he conjectured that the algebraic degrees $d_p$ of these functions should grow at most polynomially in $p$. In this article, we provide a new and elementary proof of Deligne's theorem, which yields the first general polynomial bound on $d_p$ with an explicit and reasonable degree.</description>

      <title>Formal Power Series on Algebraic Cryptanalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the complexity estimation for an attack that reduces a cryptosystem to solving a system of polynomial equations, the degree of regularity and an upper bound of the first fall degree are often used in cryptanalysis. While the degree of regularity can be easily computed using a univariate formal power series under the semi-regularity assumption, determining an upper bound of the first fall degree requires investigating the concrete syzygies of an input system. In this paper, we investigate an upper bound of the first fall degree for a polynomial system over a sufficiently large field. In this case, we prove that the first fall degree of a non-semi-regular system is bounded above by the degree of regularity, and that the first fall degree of a multi-graded polynomial system is bounded above by a certain value determined from a multivariate formal power series. Moreover, we provide a theoretical assumption for computing the first fall degree of a polynomial system over a sufficiently large field.</description>

      <title>A Fast Algorithm for the Finite Expression Method in Learning Dynamics on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex network data is prevalent in various real-world domains, including physical, technological, and biological systems. Despite this prevalence, predicting trends and understanding behavioral patterns in complex systems remain challenging due to poorly understood underlying mechanisms. While data-driven methods have advanced in uncovering governing equations from time series data, efforts to extract physical laws from network data are limited and often struggle with incomplete or noisy data. Additionally, they suffer from computational costs on network data, making it difficult to scale to real-world networks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called the Finite Expression Method (FEX) and its fast algorithm for learning dynamics on complex networks. FEX represents dynamics on complex networks using binary trees composed of finite mathematical operators. The nodes within these trees are trained through a combinatorial optimization process guided by reinforcement learning techniques. This unique configuration allows FEX to capture complex dynamics with minimal prior knowledge of the system and a small dictionary of mathematical operators. We also integrate a fast, stochastic algorithm into FEX, reducing the computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that FEX excels in accurately identifying dynamics across diverse network topologies and dynamic behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Finite Expression Method for Solving High-Dimensional Committor Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition path theory (TPT) is a mathematical framework for quantifying rare transition events between a pair of selected metastable states $A$ and $B$. Central to TPT is the committor function, which describes the probability to hit the metastable state $B$ prior to $A$ from any given starting point of the phase space. Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and the transition rate can be readily found. The committor is the solution to the backward Kolmogorov equation with appropriate boundary conditions. However, solving it is a challenging task in high dimensions due to the need to mesh a whole region of the ambient space. In this work, we explore the finite expression method (FEX, Liang and Yang (2022)) as a tool for computing the committor. FEX approximates the committor by an algebraic expression involving a fixed finite number of nonlinear functions and binary arithmetic operations. The optimal nonlinear functions, the binary operations, and the numerical coefficients in the expression template are found via reinforcement learning. The FEX-based committor solver is tested on several high-dimensional benchmark problems. It gives comparable or better results than neural network-based solvers. Most importantly, FEX is capable of correctly identifying the algebraic structure of the solution which allows one to reduce the committor problem to a low-dimensional one and find the committor with any desired accuracy.</description>
