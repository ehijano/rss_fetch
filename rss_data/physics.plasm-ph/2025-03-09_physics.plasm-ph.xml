      <title>Computation of generalised magnetic coordinates asymptotically close to the separatrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrals to calculate generalised magnetic coordinates from an input magnetic flux function asymptotically close to the separatrix are presented, and implemented in the GPEC/DCON code suite. These integrals allow characterisation of the magnetic equilibrium of a diverted tokamak, in magnetic coordinates, arbitrarily close to the last closed flux surface, avoiding the numerical issues associated with calculating diverging field line integrals near a magnetic x-point. These methods provide an important first step in the development of robust asymptotic equilibrium behaviour for spectral 3D MHD codes at the separatrix.</description>

      <title>Suppressing grid instability and noise in particle-in-cell simulation by smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smoothing short-wavelength charge density variations can stabilize explicit electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations against grid heating and cold beam instabilities, which cause unphysical heating when the Debye length is poorly resolved. We demonstrate this by solving the dispersion and by running 1D electrostatic PIC simulations, using an efficient smoothing algorithm that leverages the Poisson solve. To ensure stability, the smoothing radius must increase with the number of Debye lengths per cell. Smoothing also suppresses particle noise, which is severely exacerbated by poor resolution of the Debye length. To help determine optimal PIC configuration, we empirically characterize electric field noise, particle velocity diffusion, and unphysical energy exchanges in 1D PIC simulation, as a function of Debye-length resolution, smoothing, and particles per cell. We also show how PIC noise causes test particles to exhibit misleading behavior. Since smoothing reduces the effective resolution, the optimal cell size is less than the desired resolution but can be much greater than the Debye length, reducing computational expense.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.</description>

      <title>Ion mobility and segregation in seed surfaces subjected to cold plasma treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma treatment of seeds is an efficient procedure to accelerate germination, to improve initial stages of plant growth and for protection against pathogens infection. Most studies relate these beneficial effects with biochemical modifications affecting the metabolism and genetical growth factors of seeds and young plants. Using barley seeds, in this work we investigate the redistribution of ions in the seed surface upon their treatment with cold air plasmas. In addition, we investigate the effect of plasma in the lixiviation of ions through the seeds hull when they are immersed in water. Ions re-distribution in the outer layers of air plasma treated seeds has been experimentally determined through X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis in combination with chemical in-depth profiling with gas cluster ion beams. The results show that in the shallowest layers of the seed hull (at least up to a depth of 100 nm) there is an enrichment of K+ and Ca2+ ions, in addition to changes in the O/C and N/C atomic ratios. These data have been confirmed with the electron microscopy/fluorescence analysis of seed cuts. Observations have been accounted for by a Monte Carlo model simulating the electrostatic interactions that develop between the negative charge accumulated at the seed surface due to the interaction with the plasma sheath and the positive ions existing in the interior of seeds. Furthermore, it is shown that upon water immersion of plasma treated seeds mobilized ions tend to lixiviate more efficiently than in pristine seeds. The detection of a significant concentration of NO3- anions in the water has been attributed to a secondary reaction of nitrogen species incorporated into the seeds during plasma exposure with reactive oxygen species formed on their surface during this treatment. The implications of these findings for the improvement of germination capacity of seeds are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the use of the Axelrod formula for thermal electron collisions in Astrophysical Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Axelrod approximation is widely used in astrophysical modelling codes to evaluate electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths for forbidden transitions. Approximate methods such as this are a necessity for many heavy elements with open shells where collisional data is either non existent or sparse as the use of more robust methods prove prohibitively expensive. Atomic data for such forbidden transitions are essential for producing full collisional radiative models that do not assume Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (LTE). In this short work we repeat the optimization of the simple Axelrod formula for a large number of $R$-matrix data sets, ranging from Fe and Ni to the first r-process peak elements of Sr, Y and Zr, to higher Z systems Te, W, Pt and Au. We show that the approximate treatment of forbidden transitions can be a significant source of inaccuracy in such collisional radiative models. We find a large variance of the optimized coefficients for differing systems and charge states, although some general trends can be seen based on the orbital structure of the ground-state-configurations. These trends could potentially inform better estimates for future calculations for elements where $R$-matrix data is not available.</description>

      <title>Robustness Optimization for Compact Free-electron Laser Driven by Laser Wakefield Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the successful demonstration of compact free electron lasers (FELs) driven by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs), the shot-to-shot fluctuations inherent to LWFAs remain a major obstacle to realizing LWFA-driven FELs with high gain and robust operation. Here, we present a conceptual design for LWFA-driven FELs with enhanced robustness and reliability. By employing Bayesian optimization techniques, the beamline was optimized to achieve sufficient tolerance against these fluctuations under actual experimental conditions. Start-to-end simulations revealed that this systematic optimization significantly reduces the system's sensitivity to parametric variations. With the optimized configurations, the radiation energy can be maintained above 1 microjoule at a wavelength of approximately 25 nm, even when accounting for twice the root-mean-square (RMS) ranges of these inherent jitters. This proposed scheme represents a substantial advancement in the development of compact LWFA-driven FEL systems, enabling robust operation and paving the way for the realization of reliable and widely accessible sources.</description>

      <title>Rapid, strongly magnetized accretion in the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exist two qualitatively distinct turbulent states of the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box. The first, which has been studied in detail previously, is characterized by a weakly magnetized ($\beta\sim50$) midplane with slow periodic reversals of the mean azimuthal field (dynamo cycles). The second, the 'low-$\beta$ state,' which is the main subject of this paper, is characterized by a strongly magnetized $\beta\sim 1$ midplane dominated by a coherent azimuthal field with much stronger turbulence and much larger accretion stress ($\alpha \sim 1$). The low-$\beta$ state emerges in simulations initialized with sufficiently strong azimuthal magnetic fields. The mean azimuthal field in the low-$\beta$ state is quasi steady (no cycles) and is sustained by a dynamo mechanism that compensates for the continued loss of magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries; we attribute the dynamo to the combination of differential rotation and the Parker instability, although many of its details remain unclear. Vertical force balance in the low-$\beta$ state is dominated by the mean magnetic pressure except at the midplane, where thermal pressure support is always important (this holds true even when simulations are initialized at $\beta \ll 1$, provided the thermal scale height of the disk is well resolved). The efficient angular momentum transport in the low-$\beta$ state may resolve long-standing tension between predictions of magnetorotational turbulence (at high $\beta$) and observations; likewise, the bifurcation in accretion states we identify may be important for understanding the state transitions observed in dwarf novae, X-ray binaries, and changing-look AGN. We discuss directions for future work, including the implications of our results for global accretion disk models and simulations.</description>

      <title>Physics-consistent machine learning: output projection onto physical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning models often require extensive datasets, which can be costly or inaccessible, and their predictions may fail to comply with established physical laws. Current approaches for incorporating physical priors mitigate these issues by penalizing deviations from known physical laws, as in physics-informed neural networks, or by designing architectures that automatically satisfy specific invariants. However, penalization approaches do not guarantee compliance with physical constraints for unseen inputs, and invariant-based methods lack flexibility and generality. We propose a novel physics-consistent machine learning method that directly enforces compliance with physical principles by projecting model outputs onto the manifold defined by these laws. This procedure ensures that predictions inherently adhere to the chosen physical constraints, improving reliability and interpretability. Our method is demonstrated on two systems: a spring-mass system and a low-temperature reactive plasma. Compared to purely data-driven models, our approach significantly reduces errors in physical law compliance, enhances predictive accuracy of physical quantities, and outperforms alternatives when working with simpler models or limited datasets. The proposed projection-based technique is versatile and can function independently or in conjunction with existing physics-informed neural networks, offering a powerful, general, and scalable solution for developing fast and reliable surrogate models of complex physical systems, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Leaking Outside the Box: Kinetic Turbulence with Cosmic-Ray Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study particle acceleration in strongly turbulent pair plasmas using novel 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations, featuring particle injection from an external heat bath and diffusive escape. We demonstrate the formation of steady-state, nonthermal particle distributions with maximum energies reaching the Hillas limit. The steady state is characterized by the equilibration of plasma kinetic and magnetic pressures, which imposes upper limits on the acceleration rate. With growing cold plasma magnetization $\sigma_0$, nonthermal power-law spectra become harder, and the fraction of energy channeled into escaping cosmic rays increases. At $\sigma_0 \gtrsim 1$, the escaping cosmic rays amount to more than 50% of the dissipated energy. Our method allows for kinetic studies of particle acceleration under steady-state conditions, with applications to a variety of astrophysical systems.</description>
