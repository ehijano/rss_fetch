      <title>Symmetric observations without symmetric causal explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring causal models from observed correlations is a challenging task, crucial to many areas of science. In order to alleviate the effort, it is important to know whether symmetries in the observations correspond to symmetries in the underlying realization. Via an explicit example, we answer this question in the negative. We use a tripartite probability distribution over binary events that is realized by using three (different) independent sources of classical randomness. We prove that even removing the condition that the sources distribute systems described by classical physics, the requirements that i) the sources distribute the same physical systems, ii) these physical systems respect relativistic causality, and iii) the correlations are the observed ones, are incompatible.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Non-Gaussian Quantum State Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of bosons are a key resource in quantum information science with applications ranging from quantum metrology to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Generation of photonic non-Gaussian resource states, such as Schr\"odinger's cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states, is challenging. In this work, we extend on existing passive architectures and explore a broad set of adaptive schemes. Our numerical results demonstrate a consistent improvement in the probability of success and fidelity of generating these non-Gaussian quantum states with equivalent resources. We also explore the effect of loss as the primary limiting factor and observe that adaptive schemes lead to more desirable outcomes in terms of overall probability of success and loss tolerance. Our work offers a versatile framework for non-Gaussian resource state generation with the potential to guide future experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Computation with the $S_3$ Quantum Double: A Pedagogical Exposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological order (TO) enables topologically protected quantum computation with its anyonic quasiparticles. Recently, TO with $S_3$ gauge symmetry was identified as a sweet spot -- simple enough to emerge from finite-depth adaptive circuits yet powerful enough to support a universal topological gate-set. In these notes, we review how anyon braiding and measurement in $S_3$ TO are primitives for topological quantum computation and we explicitly demonstrate universality. These topological operations are made concrete in the $S_3$ quantum double lattice model, aided by the introduction of a generalized ribbon operator. This provides a roadmap for near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>A Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem for Repeated Bistochastic Quantum Interactions with Applications to Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider compositions of random bistochastic completely positive (bcp) maps driven by an ergodic dynamical system. Our main result is the explicit description of Oseledets's Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (MET) for such compositions in terms of the random multiplicative domains corresponding to the random bcp maps in the compositions. By applying our main theorem, we classify when compositions of random bcp maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, and use this classification to show that occasionally PPT maps are asymptotically entanglement breaking, i.e., if compositions of random bcp maps contain PPT bcp maps with positive probability, then they are asymptotically entanglement breaking almost surely. We then strengthen our results in the case of compositions of i.i.d. random bcp maps, and, by an application of the theory of random walks on linear groups, we prove a generalization of a theorem of Kuperberg for compositions of i.i.d. random bcp maps. We conclude with a cursory discussion of how to use our methods to move beyond asymptotics and find random finite times at which compositions of random bcp maps are entanglement breaking.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Signature Validation Algorithm for Efficient Detection of Tampered Transactions in Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Signature Validation Algorithm (QSVA) is introduced as a novel quantum-based approach designed to enhance the detection of tampered transactions in blockchain systems. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of quantum computing, especially within the framework of transaction-based blockchains, the QSVA aims to surpass classical methods in both speed and efficiency. By utilizing a quantum walk approach integrated with PageRank-based search algorithms, QSVA provides a robust mechanism for identifying fraudulent transactions. Our adaptation of the transaction graph representation efficiently verifies transactions by maintaining a current set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) characteristic of models like Bitcoin. The QSVA not only amplifies detection efficacy through a quadratic speedup but also incorporates two competing quantum search algorithms$-$Quantum SearchRank and Randomized SearchRank$-$to explore their effectiveness as foundational components. Our results indicate that Randomized SearchRank, in particular, outperforms its counterpart in aligning with transaction rankings based on the Classical PageRank algorithm, ensuring more consistent detection probabilities. These findings highlight the potential for quantum algorithms to revolutionize blockchain security by improving detection times to $O(\sqrt{N})$. Progress in Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) could facilitate future integration of quantum solutions into more general distributed systems. As quantum technology continues to evolve, the QSVA stands as a promising strategy offering significant advancements in blockchain efficiency and security.</description>

      <title>Randomized benchmarking of a high-fidelity remote CNOT gate over a meter-scale microwave interconnect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the modular superconducting quantum processor architecture, high-fidelity, meter-scale microwave interconnect between processor modules is a key technology for extending system size beyond constraints imposed by device manufacturing equipment, yield, and signal delivery. While there have been many demonstrations of remote state transfer between modules, these relied on tomographic experiments for benchmarking, but this technique does not reliably separate State Preparation And Measurement (SPAM) error from error per state transfer. Recent developments based on randomized benchmarking provide a compatible theory for separating these two errors. In this work, we present a module-to-module interconnect based on Tunable-Coupling Qubits (TCQs) and benchmark, in a SPAM error tolerant manner, a remote state transfer fidelity of 0.988 across a 60cm long coplanar waveguide (CPW). The state transfer is implemented via superadiabatic transitionless driving method, which suppresses intermediate excitation in internal modes of CPW. We also introduce the frame tracking technique to correct unintended qubit phase rotations before and after the state transfers, which enables the SPAM-error-tolerant benchmarking of the state transfers. We further propose and construct a remote CNOT gate between modules, composed of local CZ gates in each module and remote state transfers, and report a high gate fidelity of 0.933 using randomized benchmarking method. The remote CNOT construction and benchmarking we present is a more complete metric that fully characterizes the module to module link operation going forward as it more closely represents interconnect operation in a circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the quantum state diffusion measurement theory(QSD), the measurement problem in liquid nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) quantum computers was addressed and then it was shown that due to statistical fluctuations, the measured magnetic moment value is comparable to noise for long times. Therefore, we suggested that the measurement time should be short to distinguish signal from noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamic advantage in work extraction from steerable quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the primary goal of quantum thermodynamics -- to characterize quantum signatures and leverage their benefits in thermodynamic scenarios -- , we design a work extraction game within a bipartite framework that exhibits a quantum thermodynamic advantage. The steerability of quantum correlations between the two parties is the key resource enabling such an advantage. In designing the game, we exploit the correspondence between steerability and the incompatibility of observables. Our work extraction protocol involves mutually unbiased bases, which exhibit maximum incompatibility and therefore maximum steerability, showcased in maximally entangled quantum states. We derive upper bounds on the extractable work for unsteerable and steerable correlations and devise a protocol that saturates the latter. The ratio between the extractable work in steerable and unsteerable scenarios, which encapsulates the quantum advantage, increases with the dimension of the underlying system (sometimes referred to as an unbounded advantage). This proves a quantum thermodynamic advantage arising from steerable quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Continuous-Wave Pumped Entanglement-based QKD in Noisy Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a promising solution to protect current cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computers. As QKD transitions from laboratories to real-world applications, its implementation under various environmental conditions has become a pressing challenge. Major obstacles to practical QKD implementation are the loss of photons in the transmission media and the presence of extreme noise, which can severely limit long-range transmission. In this paper, we investigate the impact of extreme noise on QKD system parameters, including detector timing uncertainty (jitter), measurement timing shifts, variations in detector deadtime, and rate-dependent detector efficiency. Contrary to manufacturers' specifications, which assume these parameters to be constant, we demonstrate that these parameters exhibit significant variations in extreme noise conditions. We show that changes in these parameters play a key role in determining system performance in noisy environments. To address these non-idealities, we develop a robust model that can address and adapt to various detector characteristics. In particular, our model is independent of source parameters and can be implemented using data from the detection unit. Our results show that our model is well suited for characterizing and optimizing the performance of the QKD system under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>The Modified Airy Function Approximation Applied to the Double-Well Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single harmonic oscillator and double-well potentials are important systems in quantum mechanics. The single harmonic oscillator is {\it the} paradigm in physics, and is taught in nearly all beginner undergraduate classes, while the double-well potential illustrates the two important principles of quantum tunnelling and linear superposition. While exact analytical solutions of the Schrodinger equation exist for both of these potentials, they are also employed to benchmark the use of approximate techniques which may be the only recourse for more complicated potentials. In this paper, we review the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for both these potentials. While this approximation is known for its accurate energies, we will instead emphasize how poor the WKB wave functions are. The inaccuracy of the WKB wave functions will then motivate us to adopt the lesser-known Modified Airy Function (MAF) approximation, which alleviates the deficiencies of the WKB wave functions. We will review the MAF solution to the simple harmonic oscillator potential, and then apply the MAF to the double-well potential. We find accurate eigenvalues and, more importantly, very accurate wave functions. We conclude with the suggestion that an introduction to the MAF should be included in undergraduate courses to complement the WKB.</description>

      <title>Digitized counterdiabatic quantum critical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that a digitized counterdiabatic quantum protocol reduces the number of topological defects created during a fast quench across a quantum phase transition. To show this, we perform quantum simulations of one- and two-dimensional transverse-field Ising models driven from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. We utilize superconducting cloud-based quantum processors with up to 156 qubits. Our data reveal that the digitized counterdiabatic protocol reduces defect formation by up to 48% in the fast-quench regime -- an improvement hard to achieve through digitized quantum annealing under current noise levels. The experimental results closely match theoretical and numerical predictions at short evolution times, before deviating at longer times due to hardware noise. In one dimension, we derive an analytic solution for the defect number distribution in the fast-quench limit. For two-dimensional geometries, where analytical solutions are unknown and numerical simulations are challenging, we use advanced matrix-product-state methods. Our findings indicate a practical way to control the topological defect formation during fast quenches and highlight the utility of counterdiabatic protocols for quantum optimization and quantum simulation in material design on current quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Optimization of path-integral tensor-multiplication schemes in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path-integral techniques are a powerful tool used in open quantum systems to provide an exact solution for the non-Markovian dynamics. However, the exponential tensor scaling with memory length of these techniques limits the applicability when applied to systems with long memory times. Here we provide an optimization scheme which effectively reduces the tensor sizes by using a matrix representation and singular value decomposition to neglect negligible contributions. This approach dramatically reduces both computational time and memory usage of the traditional tensor-multiplication schemes. Calculations that would require over 50 million GB of RAM in the original approach are now available on standard desktop computers, allowing access to new regimes and more complex systems. As a demonstration, we apply it to the Trotter decomposition with linked cluster expansion technique, and use it to investigate a quantum dot-microcavity system at larger coupling strengths than previously achieved. Secondly, we apply the optimization when the memory time is very long - specifically in a system containing two spatially separated quantum dots in a common phonon bath.</description>

      <title>Phase space geometry of collective spin systems: Scaling and Fractality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the scaling of the inverse participation ratio of spin coherent states in the energy basis of three collective spin systems: a bounded harmonic oscillator, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, and the Quantum Kicked Top. The finite-size quantum probing provides detailed insights into the structure of the phase space, particularly the relationship between critical points in classical dynamics and their quantum counterparts in collective spin systems. We introduce a finite-size scaling mass exponent that makes it possible to identify conditions under which a power-law behavior emerges, allowing to assign a fractal dimension to a coherent state. For the Quantum Kicked Top, the fractal dimension of coherent states -- when well-defined -- exhibits three general behaviors: one related to the presence of critical points and two associated with regular and chaotic dynamics. The finite-size scaling analysis paves the way toward exploring collective spin systems relevant to quantum technologies within the quantum-classical framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum autoencoders for image classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical machine learning often struggles with complex, high-dimensional data. Quantum machine learning offers a potential solution, promising more efficient processing. While the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is suitable for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum-era hardware, its learning process relies heavily on classical computation. Future large-scale, gate-based quantum computers could unlock the full potential of quantum effects in machine learning. In contrast to QCNNs, quantum autoencoders (QAEs) leverage classical optimization solely for parameter tuning. Data compression and reconstruction are handled entirely within quantum circuits, enabling purely quantum-based feature extraction. This study introduces a novel image-classification approach using QAEs, achieving classification without requiring additional qubits compared with conventional QAE implementations. The quantum circuit structure significantly impacts classification accuracy. Unlike hybrid methods such as QCNN, QAE-based classification emphasizes quantum computation. Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy in a four-class classification task, evaluating various quantum-gate configurations to understand the impact of different parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) structures on classification performance. Our results reveal that specific ansatz structures achieve superior accuracy, and we provide an analysis of their effectiveness. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of conventional machine-learning methods while significantly reducing the number of parameters requiring optimization. These findings indicate that QAEs can serve as efficient classification models with fewer parameters and highlight the potential of utilizing quantum circuits for complete end-to-end learning, a departure from hybrid approaches such as QCNN.</description>

      <title>A Permutation-equivariant Deep Learning Model for Quantum State Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of quantum states is a fundamental step of any application of quantum technologies. Nowadays there exist several approaches addressing this problem, also based on machine and deep learning techniques. However, all these approaches usually require a number of measurement that scales exponentially with the number of parties composing the system. Threshold quantum state tomography (tQST) addresses this problem and, in some cases of interest, can significantly reduce the number of measurements. In this paper, we study how to combine a permutation-equivariant deep learning model with the tQST protocol. We test the model on quantum state tomography and purity estimation. Finally, we validate the robustness of the model to noise. We show results up to 4 qubits.</description>

      <title>Robust and Indestructible Macroscopic Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we investigate the possibility of observing macroscopic entanglement, considering realistic factors such as decoherence, particle losses, and measurements of limited precision (coarse-grained collective measurements). This forms the foundation for an operational definition of robust macroscopic entanglement. We also propose an even more resilient concept of macroscopic entanglement, allowing the parties to randomly select their portion of the shared system. Through a straightforward example, we demonstrate that achieving this is feasible using a simple class of quantum states. Our result opens a path for generalizing notions of quantum entanglement, such as a genuine multipartite entanglement in the macroscopic domain.</description>

      <title>Constructing Fermionic Hamiltonians with Non-Gaussianic low-energy states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum PCP conjecture is one of the most influential open problems in quantum complexity theory, which states that approximating the ground state energy for a sparse local Hamiltonian upto a constant is QMA-complete. However, even though the problem remains unsolved, weaker versions of it-such as the NLTS [FH13, ABN22] and NLSS [GG22] conjectures-have surfaced in the hope of providing evidence for QPCP. While the NLTS hamiltonians were first constructed in[ABN22], NLSS conjecture still remains unsolved. Weaker versions of the NLSS conjecture were addressed in [CCNN23, CCNN24], demonstrating that Clifford and almost-Clifford states-a subclass of sampleable states-have a lower energy bound on Hamiltonians prepared by conjugating the NLTS Hamiltonians from [ABN22]. In similar spirit, we construct a class of fermionic Hamilltonians for which energy of Gaussian states, a subclass of sampleable fermionic states, is bounded below by a constant. We adapt the technique used in [CCNN23] to our context.</description>

      <title>Digitized Counter-Diabatic Quantum Optimization for Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bin packing problem, a classical NP-hard combinatorial optimization challenge, has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum computing applications. In this work, we address the one-dimensional bin packing problem (1dBPP) using a digitized counter-diabatic quantum algorithm (DC-QAOA), which incorporates counter-diabatic (CD) driving to reduce quantum resource requirements while maintaining high solution quality, outperforming traditional methods such as QAOA. We evaluate three ansatz schemes-DC-QAOA, a CD-inspired ansatz, and a CD-mixer ansatz-each integrating CD terms with distinct combinations of cost and mixer Hamiltonians, resulting in different DC-QAOA variants. Among these, the CD-mixer ansatz demonstrates superior performance, showing robustness across various iteration counts, layer depths, and Hamiltonian steps, while consistently producing the most accurate approximations to exact solutions. To validate our approach, we solve a 10-item 1dBPP instance on an IBM quantum computer, optimizing circuit structures through simulations. Despite constraints on circuit depth, the CD-mixer ansatz achieves high accuracy and a high likelihood of success. These findings establish DC-QAOA, particularly the CD-mixer variant, as a powerful framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Solving quadratic binary optimization problems using quantum SDP methods: Non-asymptotic running time analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers can solve semidefinite programs (SDPs) using resources that scale better than state-of-the-art classical methods as a function of the problem dimension. At the same time, the known quantum algorithms scale very unfavorably in the precision, which makes it non-trivial to find applications for which the quantum methods are well-suited. Arguably, precision is less crucial for SDP relaxations of combinatorial optimization problems (such as the Goemans-Williamson algorithm), because these include a final rounding step that maps SDP solutions to binary variables. With this in mind, Brand\~ao, Fran\c{c}a, and Kueng have proposed to use quantum SDP solvers in order to achieve an end-to-end speed-up for obtaining approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. They did indeed succeed in identifying an algorithm that realizes a polynomial quantum advantage in terms of its asymptotic running time. However, asymptotic results say little about the problem sizes for which advantages manifest. Here, we present an analysis of the non-asymptotic resource requirements of this algorithm. The work consists of two parts. First, we optimize the original algorithm with a particular emphasis on performance for realistic problem instances. In particular, we formulate a version with adaptive step-sizes, an improved detection criterion for infeasible instances, and a more efficient rounding procedure. In a second step, we benchmark both the classical and the quantum version of the algorithm. The benchmarks did not identify a regime where even the optimized quantum algorithm would beat standard classical approaches for input sizes that can be realistically solved at all. In the absence of further significant improvements, these algorithms therefore fall into a category sometimes called galactic: Unbeaten in their asymptotic scaling behavior, but not practical for realistic problems.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate noise-resilient superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting qubit based on engineering the first and second harmonics of the Josephson energy and phase relation $E_{J1}\cos \varphi$ and $E_{J2}\cos 2\varphi$. By constructing a circuit such that $E_{J2}$ is negative and $|E_{J1}| \ll |E_{J2}|$, we create a periodic potential with two non-degenerate minima. The qubit, which we dub "harmonium", is formed from the lowest-energy states of each minimum. Bit-flip protection of the qubit arises due to the localization of each qubit state to their respective minima, while phase-flip protection can be understood by considering the circuit within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We demonstrate with time-domain simulations that single- and two-qubit gates can be performed in approximately one hundred nanoseconds. Finally, we compute the qubit coherence times using numerical diagonalization of the complete circuit in conjunction with state-of-the-art noise models. We estimate out-of-manifold heating times on the order of milliseconds, which can be treated as erasure errors using conventional dispersive readout. We estimate pure-dephasing times on the order of many tens of milliseconds, and bit-flip times on the order of seconds.</description>

      <title>A toolbox of spin-adapted generalized Pauli constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a toolbox for studying and applying spin-adapted generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs) in few-electron quantum systems. By exploiting the spin symmetry of realistic $N$-electron wave functions, the underlying one-body pure $N$-representability problem simplifies, allowing us to calculate the GPCs for larger system sizes than previously accessible. We then uncover and rigorously prove a superselection rule that highlights the significance of GPCs: whenever a spin-adapted GPC is (approximately) saturated - referred to as (quasi)pinning - the corresponding $N$-electron wave function assumes a simplified structure. Specifically, in a configuration interaction expansion based on natural orbitals only very specific spin configuration state functions may contribute. To assess the nontriviality of (quasi)pinning, we introduce a geometric measure that contrasts it with the (quasi)pinning induced by simple (spin-adapted) Pauli constraints. Applications to few-electron systems suggest that previously observed quasipinning largely stems from spin symmetries.</description>

      <title>iPEPS failure to represent corner-dependent entanglement in conformal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks, particularly the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) ansatz, have been shown to represent a vast range of quantum states. While entanglement constraints limit the representation of critical states in one-dimensional iPEPS (commonly referred to as infinite matrix product states (iMPS)), it was previously unclear whether similar limitations exist for two-dimensional iPEPS-represented states. In this work, we investigate a subleading entanglement contribution stemming from a sharp corner in the bipartition and analyze its manifestation in iPEPS. For gapped systems, the corner-dependent term is predicted by the continuum theory to have a particular opening-angle dependence and not to scale with the system size. This is shown to emerge from the iPEPS structure upon averaging over the corner's orientation with respect to the iPEPS lattice orientation. However, for conformal (critical) systems, the predicted corner term scales logarithmically with the system size. This behavior is shown to be impossible in iPEPS, again by arguments relying on the iPEPS structure. We also verify numerically their validity for a particular critical system, the Rokhsar-Kivelson state. We discuss two possible interpretations: First, iPEPS may inherently fail to capture this subleading entanglement feature, potentially indicating additional limitations in their ability to represent other properties of critical systems. Alternatively, the corner-dependent term might vanish for lattice systems, arising only in continuous conformal systems. We discuss the possible implications of this result.</description>

      <title>Characterization of P-divisibility in two-level open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study different characterizations of P-divisibility in two-level open quantum systems whose dynamics are governed by a time-local master equation with time-dependent relaxation rates. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the P-divisibility of the dynamical map are given in terms of inequalities on such relaxation rates. The equivalence between several P-divisibility characterizations existing in the literature is explicitly proven. The connection to the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure of non-Markovianity is also established. As an application of such characterizations, we study the open dynamics of a qubit interacting with a bosonic mode. More precisely, we characterize the properties of the local map on the qubit generated by its interaction with the bosonic mode, playing the role of an extremely reduced bath. Interesting observations are made, opening perspectives for a deeper physical understanding of CP-divisibility, P-divisibility, and BLP measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg lattice gases are at the forefront of quantum simulation platforms due to their inherent strong dipole-dipole interactions, long life-times and high degree of control currently achievable in experiments. We propose a simple and experimentally realizable two-dimensional lattice model consisting of two offset square sublattices of Rydberg atoms for the simulation of a so-called two-dimensional SSH model. This model reveals a plethora of topological phases, all connected through the variation of the lattice geometry. We predict the appearance of edge and corner states characterizing topological insulators, as well as pairs of topologically charged Dirac points associated with tilted and anisotropic cones in gapless semimetallic phases. The position, tilt and degree of anisotropy of the cones, which may determine the transport porperties of the system, are tunable via the sublattice offset parameters.</description>

      <title>Tailoring transport via disorder and collisions interplay in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the interplay of disorder and space-time heterogeneous collisional noise in shaping the transport dynamics of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain. Using stochastic collision models to simulate interaction with the environment, we explore the localization-delocalization transitions across regimes with single and multiple excitations. We find that space homogeneous collisions occurring at low rates favor the shaping of regions where the localization degree sets in the form of subsequent plateaus at a rate and duration universally scaling with the collision rate. We also find that interactions among the excitations favor this process even for tiniest levels of disorder.
  Our findings can be applied to design stroboscopic protocols where sequences of transport and localization can be tailored. We establish relevant connections to noise-engineering of quantum devices in noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulators platforms, and to realistic biological systems where noise and disorder coexist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active silicon-vacancy (V$_{Si}$) centers in silicon carbide (SiC) serve as qubits, interfacing spins via photons. This capability allows the encoding of photonic information within the spin state and facilitates on-demand readout, promising applications such as quantum memories. However, electron irradiation, a common technique for creating defects in SiC, lacks spatial selectivity, limiting scalability. We employed femtosecond laser writing within photonic structures to generate single (V$_{Si}$) centers, registering them to photonic structures and enhancing optical collection efficiency by a factor of 4.5. Characterization of 28 laser-written defects centers in solid immersion lenses (SILs) showed distributions relative to the photonic structure's center of 260 nm in the x-direction and 60 nm in the y-direction, with standard deviations of $\pm 170$ nm and $\pm 90$ nm, respectively. This method is scalable for developing integrated quantum devices using spin-photon interfaces in SiC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous search problems (CSPs), which involve finding solutions within a continuous domain, frequently arise in fields such as optimization, physics, and engineering. Unlike discrete search problems, CSPs require navigating an uncountably infinite space, presenting unique computational challenges. In this work, we propose a fixed-point quantum search algorithm that leverages continuous variables to address these challenges, achieving a quadratic speedup. Inspired by the discrete search results, we manage to establish a lower bound on the query complexity of arbitrary quantum search for CSPs, demonstrating the optimality of our approach. In addition, we demonstrate how to design the internal structure of the quantum search oracle for specific problems. Furthermore, we develop a general framework to apply this algorithm to a range of problem types, including optimization and eigenvalue problems involving continuous variables.</description>

      <title>Simulating Noncausality with Quantum Control of Causal Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical consistency with free local operations is compatible with non-trivial classical communications, where all parties can be both in each other's past and future - a phenomenon known as noncausality. Noncausal processes, such as the ''Lugano (AF/BW) process'', violate causal inequalities, yet their physical realizability remains an open question. In contrast, the quantum switch - a physically realizable process with indefinite causal order - can only generate causal correlations. Building on a recently established equivalence [Kunjwal and Baumeler, PRL 131, 120201 (2023)] between the SHIFT measurement, which exhibits nonlocality without entanglement, and the Lugano process, we demonstrate that the SHIFT measurement can be implemented using the quantum switch in a scenario with quantum inputs. This shows that the structure of the Lugano process can be simulated by a quantum switch and that successful SHIFT discrimination witnesses causal nonseparability rather than noncausality, refuting prior claims. Finally, we identify a broad class of ''superposition of classical communications'' derived from classical processes without global past capable of realizing similar causally indefinite measurements. We examine these results in relation to the ongoing debate on implementations of indefinite causal orders.</description>

      <title>Ontological models cannot adequately represent state update for sequential measurement of incompatible observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontological models (as used in the generalized contextuality literature) play a central role in current research on quantum foundations, serving as a framework for defining classicality, constructing classical analogues of key quantum phenomena, and even examining the ontology of quantum states. In this work, we analyse the quantum state update rule in these models and argue that incompatibility -- or, equivalently, order-dependent theoretical predictions of sequential measurements -- is sufficient to stop them from being able to adequately represent a scenario. This is because, as we argue, the quantum state update rule requires ontological models to update their states according to conditional probability, which in turn renders predictions of sequential measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given the quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour. Building on this, we argue that classical wave theory is equally incompatible with ontological models, challenging the notion that generalized contextuality serves as a signature of classicality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum relative entropy is a fundamental quantity in quantum information science, characterizing the distinguishability between two quantum states. However, this quantity is not additive in general for correlated quantum states, necessitating regularization for precise characterization of the operational tasks of interest. Recently, we proposed the study of the regularized relative entropy between two sequences of sets of quantum states in [arXiv:2411.04035], which captures a general framework for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we show that given suitable structural assumptions and efficient descriptions of the sets, the regularized relative entropy can be efficiently approximated within an additive error by a quantum relative entropy program of polynomial size. This applies in particular to the regularized relative entropy in adversarial quantum channel discrimination. Moreover, we apply the idea of efficient approximation to quantum resource theories. In particular, when the set of interest does not directly satisfy the required structural assumptions, it can be relaxed to one that does. This provides improved and efficient bounds for the entanglement cost of quantum states and channels, entanglement distillation and magic state distillation. Numerical results demonstrate improvements even for the first level of approximation.</description>

Abstract: We study the frequency-resolved density response of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to a bath of dye molecules by time-periodic driving. By monitoring the photon number dynamics for different drive frequencies, we obtain the spectral response of the condensate in a phase-sensitive way. We find that as the photon number increases, the response of the coupled condensate-bath system transitions from overdamped to resonant behavior, indicating a transition from closed to open system dynamics. Our spectroscopy method paves the way for studies of collective excitations in complex driven-dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Data Complexity Measures for Quantum Circuits Architecture Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Quantum Parametric Circuits are constructed as an alternative to reduce the size of quantum circuits, meaning to decrease the number of quantum gates and, consequently, the depth of these circuits. However, determining the optimal circuit for a given problem remains an open question. Testing various combinations is challenging due to the infinite possibilities. In this work, a quantum circuit recommendation architecture for classification problems is proposed using database complexity measures. A quantum circuit is defined based on a circuit layer and the number of times this layer is iterated. Fourteen databases of varying dimensions and different numbers of classes were used to evaluate six quantum circuits, each with 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 16-layer repetitions. Using data complexity measures from the databases, it was possible to identify the optimal circuit capable of solving all problems with up to 100$\%$ accuracy. Furthermore, with a mean absolute error of 0.80 $\pm$ 2.17, one determined the appropriate number of layer repetitions, allowing for an error margin of up to three additional layers. Sixteen distinct machine learning models were employed for the selection of quantum circuits, alongside twelve classical regressor models to dynamically define the number of layers.</description>

Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Black Hole Mass Estimation in Type-2 AGNs: Classical vs. Quantum Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the case of Type-2 AGNs, estimating the mass of the black hole is challenging. Understanding how galaxies form and evolve requires considerable insight into the mass of black holes. This work compared different classical and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms for black hole mass estimation, wherein the classical algorithms are Linear Regression, XGBoost Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Bayesian Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Booster Regressor, Classical Neural Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), LSTM, Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) and Transformer-Based Regression. On the other hand, quantum algorithms including Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (Q-LSTM), Sampler-QNN, Estimator-QNN, Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR), Quantum Linear Regression(Q-LR), QML with JAX optimization were also tested. The results revealed that classical algorithms gave better R^2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE results than the quantum models. Among the classical models, LSTM has the best result with an accuracy of 99.77%. Estimator-QNN has the highest accuracy for quantum algorithms with an MSE of 0.0124 and an accuracy of 99.75%. This study ascertains both the strengths and weaknesses of the classical and the quantum approaches. As far as our knowledge goes, this work could pave the way for the future application of quantum algorithms in astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>EDA-Q: Electronic Design Automation for Superconducting Quantum Chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) plays a crucial role in classical chip design and significantly influences the development of quantum chip design. However, traditional EDA tools cannot be directly applied to quantum chip design due to vast differences compared to the classical realm. Several EDA products tailored for quantum chip design currently exist, yet they only cover partial stages of the quantum chip design process instead of offering a fully comprehensive solution. Additionally, they often encounter issues such as limited automation, steep learning curves, challenges in integrating with actual fabrication processes, and difficulties in expanding functionality. To address these issues, we developed a full-stack EDA tool specifically for quantum chip design, called EDA-Q. The design workflow incorporates functionalities present in existing quantum EDA tools while supplementing critical design stages such as device mapping and fabrication process mapping, which users expect. EDA-Q utilizes a unique architecture to achieve exceptional scalability and flexibility. The integrated design mode guarantees algorithm compatibility with different chip components, while employing a specialized interactive processing mode to offer users a straightforward and adaptable command interface. Application examples demonstrate that EDA-Q significantly reduces chip design cycles, enhances automation levels, and decreases the time required for manual intervention. Multiple rounds of testing on the designed chip have validated the effectiveness of EDA-Q in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Vibrationally highly excited trilobite molecules stabilized by non-adiabatic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the observation of highly excited ($\nu \sim 100)$ vibrational states of a trilobite ultralong-range Rydberg molecule in $^{87}$Rb. These states manifest spectroscopically in a regularly spaced series of peaks red-detuned from the $25f_{7/2}$ dissociation threshold. The existence and observed stability of these states requires the almost complete suppression of the adiabatic decay pathway induced by the $P$-wave shape resonance of Rb. This stabilization is predicted to occur only for certain Rydberg levels where the avoided crossing between trilobite and $P$-wave dominated butterfly potential energy curves nearly vanishes, allowing the vibrational states to diabatically traverse the crossing with almost unit probability. This is the first direct measurement of beyond-Born-Oppenheimer physics in long-range Rydberg molecules, and paves the way for future experiments to access and manipulate wavepackets formed from high-lying vibrational states.</description>

      <title>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</description>

Abstract: The fact that the probability density expression provided by the Klein-Gordon equation can take on negative values is usually seen as an obstacle to formulating a particle interpretation of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, reconciling this expression with a particle ontology is quite possible once a careful distinction is drawn between the outcomes of measurements and the positions of particles between measurements. Following this path, however, points to the involvement of retrocausality, as proposed by various authors in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Rounding near-optimal quantum strategies for nonlocal games to strategies using maximally entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish approximate rigidity results for several well-known families of nonlocal games. In particular, we show that near-perfect quantum strategies for boolean constraint system (BCS) games are approximate representations of the corresponding BCS algebra. Likewise, for the class of XOR nonlocal games, we show that near-optimal quantum strategies are approximate representations of the corresponding $*$-algebra associated with optimal quantum values for the game. In both cases, the approximate representations are with respect to the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt norm and independent of the Hilbert space or quantum state employed in the strategy. We also show that approximate representation of the BCS (resp.~XOR-algebra) yields measurement operators for near-perfect (resp.~near-optimal) quantum strategies where the players employ a maximally entangled state in the game. As a corollary, every near-perfect BCS (resp.~near-optimal XOR) quantum strategy is close to a near-perfect (resp.~near-optimal) quantum strategy using a maximally entangled state. Lastly, we establish that every synchronous algebra is $*$-isomorphic to a certain BCS algebra called the SynchBCS algebra. This allows us to apply our BCS rigidity results to the class of synchronous games as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging is a three-dimensional imaging technique, where a gradient of the magnetic field is used to interrogate spin resonances with spatial resolution. The application of this technique to probe the coherence of atoms with good three-dimensional resolution is a challenging application. We propose and demonstrate an optical method to probe spin resonances via a two-photon Raman transition, reconstructing the 3D-structure of an atomic ensemble's coherence, which is itself subject to external fields. Our method relies on a single time-and-space resolved heterodyne measurement, allowing the reconstruction of a complex 3D coherence profile. Owing to the optical interface, we reach a tomographic image resolution of $14\times14\times36$ $\mu\mathrm{m}^3$. The technique allows to probe any transparent medium with a resonance structure and provides a robust diagnostic tool for atom-based quantum information protocols. As such, it is a viable technique for application to magnetometry, electrometry, and imaging of electromagnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Consistent dynamics which couples classical and quantum degrees of freedom exists. This dynamics is linear in the hybrid state, completely positive and trace preserving. Starting from completely positive classical-quantum master equations, we derive a general path integral representation for such dynamics in terms of a classical-quantum action, which includes the necessary and sufficient conditions for complete positivity and trace preservation. The path integral we study is a generalization of the Feynman path integral for quantum systems, and the stochastic path integral used to study classical stochastic processes, allowing for interaction between the classical and quantum systems. When the classical-quantum Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the momenta we are able to derive a configuration space path integral, providing a map between master equations and covariant classical-quantum path integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00137v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes is a class of convolutional LDPC codes that has been well investigated in classical coding theory thanks to their high performance and compatibility with low-latency decoders. We describe toric codes as quantum counterparts of classical two-dimensional spatially-coupled (2D-SC) codes, and introduce spatially-coupled quantum LDPC (SC-QLDPC) codes as a generalization. We use the convolutional structure to represent the parity check matrix of a 2D-SC code as a polynomial in two indeterminates, and derive an algebraic condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a 2D-SC code to be a stabilizer code. This algebraic framework facilitates the construction of new code families. While not the focus of this paper, we note that small memory facilitates physical connectivity of qubits, and it enables local encoding and low-latency windowed decoding. In this paper, we use the algebraic framework to optimize short cycles in the Tanner graph of 2D-SC hypergraph product (HGP) codes that arise from short cycles in either component code. While prior work focuses on QLDPC codes with rate less than 1/10, we construct 2D-SC HGP codes with small memories, higher rates (about 1/3), and superior thresholds.</description>

      <title>Optimal Local Measurements in Single-Parameter Quantum Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurement plays a crucial role in quantum metrology. Due to the limitations of experimental capabilities, collectively measuring multiple copies of probing systems can present significant challenges. Therefore, the concept of locality in quantum measurements must be considered. In this work, we investigate the possibility of achieving the Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound (QCRB) through local measurements (LM). We first demonstrate that if there exists a LM to saturate the QCRB for qubit systems, then we can construct another rank-1 local projective measurement to saturate the QCRB. In this sense, rank-1 local projective measurements are sufficient to analyze the problem of saturating the QCRB. For pure qubits, we propose two necessary and sufficient methods to determine whether and how a given parameter estimation model can achieve QCRB through LM. The first method, dubbed iterative matrix partition method (IMP) and based on unitary transformations that render the diagonal entries of a tracless matrix vanish, elucidates the underlying mathematical structure of LM as well as the local measurements with classical communications (LMCC), generalizing the result by [Zhou et al Quantum Sci. Technol. 5, 025005 (2020)], which only holds for the later case. We clarify that the saturation of QCRB through LM for the GHZ-encoded states is actually due to the self-similar structure in this approach. The second method, dubbed hierarchy of orthogonality conditions (HOC) and based on the parametrization of rank-1 measurements for qubit systems, allows us to construct several examples of saturating QCRB, including the three-qubit W states and $N$-qubit W states ($N \geq 3$). Our findings offer insights into achieving optimal performance in quantum metrology when measurement resources are limited.</description>

      <title>Quantum Markov Decision Processes: Dynamic and Semi-Definite Programs for Optimal Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, building on the formulation of quantum Markov decision processes (q-MDPs) presented in our previous work [{\sc N.~Saldi, S.~Sanjari, and S.~Y\"{u}ksel}, {\em Quantum Markov Decision Processes: General Theory, Approximations, and Classes of Policies}, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 2024], our focus shifts to the development of semi-definite programming approaches for optimal policies and value functions of both open-loop and classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. First, by using the duality between the dynamic programming and the semi-definite programming formulations of any q-MDP with open-loop policies, we establish that the optimal value function is linear and there exists a stationary optimal policy among open-loop policies. Then, using these results, we establish a method for computing an approximately optimal value function and formulate computation of optimal stationary open-loop policy as a bi-linear program. Next, we turn our attention to classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. Dynamic programming and semi-definite programming formulations for classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies are established, where duality of these two formulations similarly enables us to prove that the optimal policy is linear and there exists an optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policy. Then, similar to the open-loop case, we establish a method for computing the optimal value function and pose computation of optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies as a bi-linear program.</description>

      <title>Clustering theorem in 1D long-range interacting systems at arbitrary temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into a fundamental aspect of quantum statistical mechanics -- the absence of thermal phase transitions in one-dimensional (1D) systems. Originating from Ising's analysis of the 1D spin chain, this concept has been pivotal in understanding 1D quantum phases, especially those with finite-range interactions as extended by Araki. In this work, we focus on quantum long-range interactions and successfully derive a clustering theorem applicable to a wide range of interaction decays at arbitrary temperatures. This theorem applies to any interaction forms that decay faster than $r^{-2}$ and does not rely on translation invariance or infinite system size assumptions. Also, we rigorously established that the temperature dependence of the correlation length is given by $e^{{\rm const.} \beta}$, which is the same as the classical cases. Our findings indicate the absence of phase transitions in 1D systems with super-polynomially decaying interactions, thereby expanding upon previous theoretical research. To overcome significant technical challenges originating from the divergence of the imaginary-time Lieb-Robinson bound, we utilize the quantum belief propagation to refine the cluster expansion method. This approach allowed us to address divergence issues effectively and contributed to a deeper understanding of low-temperature behaviors in 1D quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Maximally Entangled State Generation via Pontryagin's Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an optimal control strategy to generate maximally entangled states in bipartite quantum systems. Leveraging the Pontryagin Principle, we derive time-dependent control fields that maximize the entanglement measure, specifically concurrence, within minimal time while adhering to input constraints. Our formulation addresses the Liouville-von Neumann dynamics of the reduced density matrix under unitary evolution. The strategy is numerically validated through simulations, demonstrating its ability to drive the system from an initial perturbed separable state to a maximally entangled target state. The results showcase the effectiveness of switching control fields in optimizing entanglement, with potential applications in quantum technologies, including communication, computation, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian state teleportation with a nonlinear feedforward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-induced quantum computation with continuous-variable cluster states utilizes teleportation propagating the states through the cluster accompanied by non-Gaussian measurements and feedforward control. We analyze such propagation of a quantum non-Gaussian state with nonlinear squeezing through a small cluster state and show that when a nonlinear feedforward is involved in the teleportation protocol, higher nonlinear squeezing can be transferred. In a probabilistic regime, the improvement can be manifested even with current experimental resources. Better processing of non-Gaussian states can bring us closer to the necessary interplay between cluster states and non-Gaussianity required by quantum computing.</description>

      <title>State Transfer and Readout Times for Trees of Diameter 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the state transfer properties of continuous time quantum walks on trees of diameter 4. We characterize all pairs of strongly cospectral vertices in trees of diameter 4, finding that they fall into pairs of three different types. For each type, we construct an infinite family of diameter 4 trees for which there is pretty good state transfer between the pair of strongly cospectral vertices. Moreover, for two of those types, for each tree in the infinite family, we give an explicit sequence of readout times at which the fidelity of state transfer converges to $1$. For strongly cospectral vertices of the remaining type, we identify a sequence of trees and explicit readout times so that the fidelity of state transfer between the strongly cospectral vertices approaches $1.$
  We also prove a result of independent interest: for a graph with the property that the fidelity of state transfer between a pair of vertices at time $t_k$ converges to $1$ as $k \rightarrow \infty,$ then the derivative of the fidelity at $t_k$ converges to $0$ as $k \rightarrow \infty. $</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics is one of the most important applications of quantum computers. Traditional approaches for quantum simulation involve preparing the full evolved state of the system and then measuring some physical quantity. Here, we present a different and novel approach to quantum simulation that uses a compressed quantum state that we call the ``shadow state''. The amplitudes of this shadow state are proportional to the time-dependent expectations of a specific set of operators of interest, and it evolves according to its own Schr\"odinger equation. This evolution can be simulated on a quantum computer efficiently under broad conditions. Applications of this approach to quantum simulation problems include simulating the dynamics of exponentially large systems of free fermions or free bosons, the latter example recovering a recent algorithm for simulating exponentially many classical harmonic oscillators. These simulations are hard for classical methods and also for traditional quantum approaches, as preparing the full states would require exponential resources. Shadow Hamiltonian simulation can also be extended to simulate expectations of more complex operators such as two-time correlators or Green's functions, and to study the evolution of operators themselves in the Heisenberg picture.</description>

      <title>Perfect Wave Transfer in Continuous Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transfer of information from one part of a quantum system to another is fundamental to the understanding and design of quantum information processing devices. In the realm of discrete systems, such as spin chains, inhomogeneous networks have been engineered that allow for the perfect transfer of qubits from one end to the other. Here, by contrast, we investigate perfect transfer of information in continuous systems, phrased in terms of wave propagation. A remarkable difference is found between systems that possess conformal invariance and those that do not. Systems in the first class enjoy perfect wave transfer (PWT), explicitly shown for one-particle excitations and expected in general. In the second class, those that exhibit PWT are characterized as solutions to an inverse spectral problem. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how to formulate and solve this problem for a prototypical class of bosonic theories, showing the importance of conformal invariance for these theories to enjoy PWT. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend to theories with interactions, broadening the scope of perfect information transfer to more general quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Realizing a mechanical dynamical Casimir effect with a low-frequency oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to realize a mechanical dynamical Casimir effect (MDCE) in a hybrid optomechanical system consisting of a cavity mode, a low-frequency mechanical oscillator, and a two-level atomic system. Described by the effective Hamiltonian, the mechanical energy is directly converted to the photons through a three-wave-mixing mechanism. It is not a quantum simulation of a parametric DCE such as in superconducting circuits. Using a master-equation approach, we analyze the system dynamics in various regimes with respect to the ratio of the effective coupling strength and the loss rate of the system. The dynamics under the strong-coupling regime confirms various three-wave-mixing processes for creating photons by annihilation of mechanical and atomic excitations. Under the weak-coupling regime, a continuous production of photons can be demonstrated by driving both the mechanical oscillator and atom. By virtue of an atom of tunable frequency, our method avoids using the high-frequency mechanical oscillator, which is required for the conventional DCE in optomechanical systems under the double-photon resonance yet is out of reach of experiment. It is found that the mechanical frequency can be about two orders smaller than the cavity mode in yielding a remarkable flux of DCE photons.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) beyond the i.i.d. framework where the random samples are drawn from two sets of quantum states. In particular, under suitable assumptions on the sets, we prove that all operationally relevant divergences converge to the quantum relative entropy between the sets. More specifically, both the smoothed min- and max-relative entropy approach the regularized relative entropy between the sets. Notably, the asymptotic limit has explicit convergence guarantees and can be efficiently estimated through convex optimization programs, despite the regularization, provided that the sets have efficient descriptions.
  We give three applications of this result: (i) The generalized AEP directly implies a new generalized quantum Stein's lemma for conducting quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states. (ii) We introduce a quantum version of adversarial hypothesis testing where the tester plays against an adversary who possesses internal quantum memory and controls the quantum device and show that the optimal error exponent is precisely characterized by a new notion of quantum channel divergence, named the minimum output channel divergence. (iii) We derive a relative entropy accumulation theorem stating that the smoothed min-relative entropy between two sequential processes of quantum channels can be lower bounded by the sum of the regularized minimum output channel divergences.
  At a technical level, we establish new additivity and chain rule properties for the measured relative entropy which we expect will have more applications.</description>

      <title>Genuine Multipartite Entanglement in Quantum Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to generate bipartite entanglement in quantum computing technologies is widely regarded as pivotal. However, the role of genuinely multipartite entanglement is much less understood than bipartite entanglement, particularly in the context of solving complicated optimization problems using quantum devices. It is thus crucial from both the algorithmic and hardware standpoints to understand whether multipartite entanglement contributes to achieving a good solution. Here, we tackle this challenge by analyzing genuine multipartite entanglement -- quantified by the generalized geometric measure -- generated in Trotterized quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Using numerical benchmarks, we analyze its occurrence in the annealing schedule in detail. We observe a multipartite-entanglement barrier, and we explore how it correlates to the algorithm's success. We also prove how multipartite entanglement provides an upper bound to the overlap of the instantaneous state with an exact solution. Vice versa, the overlaps to the initial and final product states, which can be easily measured experimentally, offer upper bounds for the multipartite entanglement during the entire schedule. Our results help to shed light on how complex quantum correlations come to bear as a resource in quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We extend the standard semiclassical theory of Excited-State Quantum Phase Transitions (ESQPTs), based on a classification of stationary points in the classical Hamiltonian, to constrained systems. We adopt the method of Lagrange multipliers to find all stationary points and their properties directly from the Hamiltonian constrained by an arbitrary number of integrals of motion, and demonstrate the procedure on an algebraic u(3) boson model with two independent constraints. We also elaborate the Holstein-Primakoff (HP) mapping, used to eliminate one degree of freedom in bosonic systems constrained by a conserved number of excitations, and address the fact that this mapping leads, in the classical limit, to a compact phase space with singular behaviour that conceals some stationary points at the phase space boundary. It is shown that the HP method reveals all ESQPTs only after constructing a complete atlas of different HP mappings.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) have gained attention for their potential to enhance computational performance by incorporating quantum layers into classical neural network (NN) architectures. However, a key question remains: Do quantum layers offer computational advantages over purely classical models? This paper explores how classical and hybrid models adapt their architectural complexity to increasing problem complexity. Using a multiclass classification problem, we benchmark classical models to identify optimal configurations for accuracy and efficiency, establishing a baseline for comparison. HQNNs, simulated on classical hardware (as common in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era), are evaluated for their scaling of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameter growth. Our findings reveal that as problem complexity increases, HQNNs exhibit more efficient scaling of architectural complexity and computational resources. For example, from 10 to 110 features, HQNNs show an 53.1% increase in FLOPs compared to 88.1% for classical models, despite simulation overheads. Additionally, the parameter growth rate is slower in HQNNs (81.4%) than in classical models (88.5%). These results highlight HQNNs' scalability and resource efficiency, positioning them as a promising alternative for solving complex computational problems.</description>

      <title>Interplay between dressed and strong-axial-field states in Nitrogen-Vacancy centers for quantum sensing and computation</title>

Abstract: The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an intriguing electronic spin system with applications in quantum radiometry, sensing and computation. In those experiments, a bias magnetic field is commonly applied along the NV symmetry axis to eliminate the triplet ground state manifold's degeneracy (S=1). In this configuration, the eigenvectors of the NV spin's projection along its axis are called strong-axial field states. Conversely, in some experiments a weak magnetic field is applied orthogonal to the NV symmetry axis, leading to eigenstates that are balanced linear superpositions of strong-axial field states, referred to as dressed states. The latter are sensitive to environmental magnetic noise at the second order, allowing to perform magnetic field protected measurements while providing increased coherence times. However, if a small axial magnetic field is added in this regime, the linear superposition of strong-axial field states becomes unbalanced. This paper presents a comprehensive study of Free Induction Decay (FID) measurements performed on a NV center ensemble in the presence of strain and weak orthogonal magnetic field, as a function of a small magnetic field applied along the NV symmetry axis. The simultaneous detection of dressed states and unbalanced superpositions of strong-axial field states in a single FID measurement is shown, gaining insight about coherence time, nuclear spin and the interplay between temperature and magnetic field sensitivity. The discussion concludes by describing how the simultaneous presence of magnetically-sensitive and -insensitive states opens up appealing possibilities for both sensing and quantum computation applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the potential of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver in solving Dynamic Portfolio Optimization problems surpassing the 100 qubit utility frontier. We systematically analyze how to scale this strategy in complexity and size, from 6 to 112 qubits, by testing different combinations of ansatz and optimizer on a real Quantum Processing Unit. We achieve best results by using a combination of a Differential Evolution classical optimizer and an ansatz circuit tailored to both the problem and the properties of the Quantum Processing Unit.</description>

      <title>A graph-based approach to entanglement entropy of quantum error correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a graph-based method to study the entanglement entropy of Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum codes. This method offers a straightforward interpretation for the entanglement entropy of quantum error correcting codes through graph-theoretical concepts, shedding light on the origins of both the local and long-range entanglement. Furthermore, it inspires an efficient computational scheme for evaluating the entanglement entropy. We illustrate the method by calculating the von Neumann entropy of subsystems in toric codes and a special type of quantum low-density-parity check codes, known as bivariate bicycle codes, and by comparing the scaling behavior of entanglement entropy with respect to subsystem size. Our method provides a new perspective for understanding the entanglement structure in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Transition from non-ergodic to ergodic dynamics in an autonomous discrete time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an autonomous system of two coupled single-mode cavities, one of which interacts with a multimode resonator. We demonstrate that for small coupling strengths between single-mode cavities, the Loschmidt echo oscillates periodically in time and spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry takes place. The Loschmidt echo behavior is an indication of the non-ergodic nature of the system when its evolution is time-reversible and the system retains a memory of the initial state under the action of small perturbations. This behavior reveals the presence of a time crystalline order in the autonomous system. In this regime, the system is a new class of time crystals - autonomous discrete time crystals. An increase in the coupling strength leads to a transition from periodic oscillations to an exponential decay in time of the Loschmidt echo. This corresponds to the transition from non-ergodic behavior to ergodic one in the system, and is accompanied by the disappearance of time crystalline order. We demonstrate that at the transition point the time-averaged variance of the number of photons reaches a maximum, which serves as a signature of the transition. We show that such a transition can also be observed when changing the number of degrees of freedom in the resonator, which is achieved by changing its length.</description>

      <title>The Born rule -- 100 years ago and today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Details of the contents and the formulations of the Born rule changed considerably from its inception by Born in 1926 to the present day. This paper traces the early history of the Born rule 100 years ago, its generalization (essential for today's quantum optics and quantum information theory) to POVMs around 50 years ago, and a modern derivation from an intuitive definition of the notion of a quantum detector. It is based to a large extent on little known results from the recent books 'Coherent Quantum Physics' (2019) by A. Neumaier and 'Algebraic Quantum Physics, Vol. 1' (2024) by A. Neumaier and D. Westra,
  Also discussed is the extent to which the various forms of the Born rule have, like any other statement in physics, a restricted domain of validity, which leads to problems when applied outside this domain.</description>

      <title>High-Harmonic Generation in a Crystal Driven by Quantum Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study intraband high-harmonic generation (HHG) in a crystal driven by quantum light. Previous theoretical studies have developed a framework based on coherent state expansions in terms of P distributions to consider nonclassical driving fields for HHG in atoms. Here, we adapt this framework to the context of solids and consider an intraband model of ZnO. We investigate the effect of the quantum optical nature of the driving field on the harmonic spectra including the cutoff and the intensity scaling of the harmonics with driving field intensity. Based on analytical calculations in the Floquet limit, we explain why driving with thermal light or bright-squeezed vacuum (BSV) produces a much higher cutoff than when driving with fields described by coherent or Fock states. Further, we derive an expression for the generated time-dependent electric field and its fluctuations and find that it inherits characteristics of the driving field. Finally, we discuss the limitations of an approximative positive P representation, which is introduced to be able to reduce the numerical complexity for Fock and BSV driving fields.</description>

      <title>Revealing Symmetry-Broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A coherent theory for the superconductivity of both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) due to atomic perturbation of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). This perturbation creates straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) for charge density of electrons and/or holes as revealed by the calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The SODTs act as resistance-free superhighways and are correlated to the Cooper pairs in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The formation of SODTs implies that the electron-phonon interaction in the BCS theory can be represented by the difference in charge densities between SCC and NCC predicted by DFT. The present work highlights that in conventional superconductors, SODTs are embedded within the bulk materials and are easily destroyed by phonon vibrations, resulting in a low critical superconducting temperature (T_C). Conversely, in unconventional superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7), SODTs are protected by a layered pontoon structure with very weak bonding to the bulk materials, maintaining SODTs' stability at higher temperatures and leading to a much higher T_C. The present approach is validated for 13 conventional superconductors of 18 pure elements examined in this work, including the presently predicted superconductivity in Cu, Ag, Au, Sb, and Bi at 0 K and 0 GPa, and one unconventional superconductor of YBCO7. Our discovery indicates that DFT can be a practical tool for predicting superconductors, enabling a systematic search for new superconducting materials in the future.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Coupled Mode Setups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In optics and photonics, a small number of building blocks, like resonators, waveguides, arbitrary couplings, and parametric interactions, allow the design of a broad variety of devices and functionalities, distinguished by their scattering properties. These include transducers, amplifiers, and nonreciprocal devices, like isolators or circulators. Usually, the design of such a system is handcrafted by an experienced scientist in a time-consuming process where it remains uncertain whether the simplest possibility has indeed been found. In our work, we develop the discovery algorithm AutoScatter [https://github.com/jlandgr/autoscatter] that automates this challenge. By optimizing the continuous and discrete system properties our automated search identifies the minimal resources required to realize the requested scattering behavior. In the spirit of artificial scientific discovery, it produces a complete list of interpretable solutions and leads to generalizable insights, as we illustrate in several examples. This opens the door towards automated discovery of scattering setups for photonics, microwaves and optomechanics, with possible future extensions to periodic structures, sensing, and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Tensorization of neural networks for improved privacy and interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a tensorization algorithm for constructing tensor train representations of functions, drawing on sketching and cross interpolation ideas. The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the tensor train representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing tensor trains in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Exposing a Fatal Flaw in Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr\"odinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we show that QSCI methods face fundamental limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality CI expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a fatal flaw in QSCI methods as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Monitored interacting Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma&gt;\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma&lt;\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>The Observational Partial Order of Causal Structures with Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two causal structures with the same set of visible variables, one is said to observationally dominate the other if the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the first contains the set of distributions over the visible variables realizable by the second. Knowing such dominance relations is useful for adjudicating between these structures given observational data. We here consider the problem of determining the partial order of equivalence classes of causal structures with latent variables relative to observational dominance. We provide a complete characterization of the dominance order in the case of three visible variables, and a partial characterization in the case of four visible variables. Our techniques also help to identify which observational equivalence classes have a set of realizable distributions that is characterized by nontrivial inequality constraints, analogous to Bell inequalities and instrumental inequalities. We find evidence that as one increases the number of visible variables, the equivalence classes satisfying nontrivial inequality constraints become ubiquitous. (Because such classes are the ones for which there can be a difference in the distributions that are quantumly and classically realizable, this implies that the potential for quantum-classical gaps is also ubiquitous.) Furthermore, we find evidence that constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that rely solely on conditional independence constraints have a significantly weaker distinguishing power among observational equivalence classes than algorithms that go beyond these (i.e., algorithms that also leverage nested Markov constraints and inequality constraints).</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Gauge Potential as a Tool for Detecting Chaos in Classical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between chaos and thermalization in weakly non-integrable systems is a rich and complex subject. Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We conclude by commenting on the wide applicability of our method to a broader class of systems.</description>
