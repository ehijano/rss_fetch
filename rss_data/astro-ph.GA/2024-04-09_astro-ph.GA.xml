      <title>Confusion of extragalactic sources in the far infrared: a baseline assessment of the performance of PRIMAger in intensity and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of their limited angular resolution, far-infrared telescopes are usually affected by confusion phenomenon. Since several galaxies can be located in the same instrumental beam, only the brightest objects emerge from the fluctuations caused by fainter sources. The probe far-infrared mission for astrophysics imager (PRIMAger) will observe the mid- and far-infrared (25-235 $\mu$m) sky both in intensity and polarization. We aim to provide predictions of the confusion level and its consequences for future surveys. We produced simulated PRIMAger maps affected only by the confusion noise using the simulated infrared extragalactic sky (SIDES) semi-empirical simulation. We then estimated the confusion limit in these maps and extracted the sources using a basic blind extractor. By comparing the input galaxy catalog and the extracted source catalog, we derived various performance metrics as completeness, purity, and the accuracy of various measurements. In intensity, we predict that the confusion limit increases rapidly with increasing wavelength. The confusion limit in polarization is more than 100x lower. The measured flux density is dominated by the brightest galaxy in the beam, but other objects also contribute at longer wavelength (~30% at 235 $\mu$m). We also show that galaxy clustering has a mild impact on confusion in intensity (up to 25%), while it is negligible in polarization. In intensity, a basic blind extraction will be sufficient to detect galaxies at the knee of the luminosity function up to z~3 and 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ main-sequence galaxies up to z~5. In polarization for the baseline sensitivity, we expect ~8 000 detections up to z=2.5 opening a totally new window on the high-z dust polarization. Finally, we show that intensity surveys at short wavelength and polarization surveys at long wavelength tend to reach confusion at similar depth. There is thus a strong synergy.</description>

      <title>Searching for Emission Lines at $z&gt;11$: The Role of Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ and Hints About the Escape of Ionizing Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04325</link>

Abstract: We describe new ultra-deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec PRISM and grating spectra for the galaxies JADES-GS-z11-0 ($z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 11.122^{+0.005}_{-0.003}$) and JADES-GS-z13-0 ($z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 13.20^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), the most distant spectroscopically-confirmed galaxy discovered in the first year of JWST observations. The extraordinary depth of these observations (75 hours and 56 hours, respectively) provides a unique opportunity to explore the redshifts, stellar properties, UV magnitudes, and slopes for these two sources. For JADES-GS-z11-0, we find evidence for multiple emission lines, including [OII]3726,3729 and [NeIII]3869, resulting in a spectroscopic redshift we determine with 94% confidence. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman-$\alpha$ break in JADES-GS-z11-0 can be fit with a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber with $\log{(N_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2})} = 22.42^{+0.093}_{-0.120}$. We present stringent upper limits on the emission line fluxes and line equivalent widths for JADES-GS-z13-0. These results demonstrate how neutral hydrogen fraction and Lyman-damping wings may impact the recovery of spectroscopic redshifts for sources like these, providing insight into the overprediction of the photometric redshifts seen for distant galaxies observed with JWST. In addition, we analyze updated NIRCam photometry to calculate the morphological properties of these resolved sources, and find a secondary source $0.3^{\prime\prime}$ south of JADES-GS-z11-0 at a similar photometric redshift, hinting at how galaxies grow through interactions in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI observations of an expanding, jet-driven bubble of warm H$_2$ in the radio galaxy 3C 326 N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical link between AGN activity and the suppression of star formation in their host galaxies is one of the major open questions of AGN feedback. The Spitzer space mission revealed a subset of nearby radio galaxies with unusually bright line emission from warm ($T\ge 100$ K) H$_2$, while typical star-formation tracers were exceptionally faint or undetected. We present JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFU observations of 3C 326 N at z=0.09 and identify 19 ro-vibrational H$_2$ emission lines that probe hot ($T\sim 1000$ K) gas as well as the rotational lines of H$_2$ 0--0 S(3), S(5), and S(6) which probe most of the $2\times 10^9$ M$_\odot$ of warm H$_2$ in this galaxy. CO band heads show a stellar component consistent with a "slow-rotator", typical of a massive $3\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ galaxy, and provide us with a reliable redshift of $z=0.08979\pm 0.0003$. Extended line emission shows a bipolar bubble expanding through the molecular disk at velocities of up to 380 km s$^{-1}$, delineated by several bright clumps along the Northern outer rim, potentially from gas fragmentation. Throughout the disk, the H$_2$ is very broad, FWHM ~100-1300 km s$^{-1}$, and shows dual-component Gaussian line profiles. [FeII]$\lambda$1.644 and Pa$\alpha$ follow the same morphology, however [NeIII]$\lambda$15.56 is more symmetric about the nucleus. We show that the gas, with the exception of [NeIII]$\lambda$15.56, is predominantly heated by shocks driven by the radio jet and that the accompanying line broadening is sufficient to suppress star formation. We also compare the rotational and ro-vibrational lines, finding that the latter can be a good proxy to the global morphology and kinematic properties of the former in strongly turbulent environments. This enables studies of turbulence in galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts while most rotational lines are redshifted out of the MIRI bandpass for $z$&gt;1.5.</description>

      <title>Automated Detection of Galactic Rings from SDSS Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphological features in galaxies, like spiral arms, bars, rings, tidal tails etc. carry information about their structure, origin and evolution. It is therefore important to catalogue and study such features and to correlate them with other basic galaxy properties the environment in which the galaxies are located and their interactions with other galaxies. Surveys such as SDSS, Pan-STARRS, HSC-SSP have made available very large samples of galaxies for gainful morphological studies. The availability of galaxy images and catalogues will increase manifold with future surveys like LSST. The volume of present and future data is so large that traditional methods, which involve expert astronomers identifying morphological features through visual inspection, are no longer sufficient. It is therefore necessary to use AI based techniques like machine learning and deep learning for finding morphological structures quickly and efficiently. We report in this study the application of deep learning for finding ring like structures in galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release DR18. We use a catalogue by Buta (2017) of ringed galaxies from the SDSS to train the network reaching good accuracy and recall, and generate a catalogue of 29420 galaxies of which 9805 have ring like structures with prediction confidence exceeding 90 percent. Using a catalogue of barred galaxy images identified by Abraham et. al. (2018) using deep learning techniques, we identify a set of 2087 galaxies with bars as well as rings. The catalogues should be very useful in understanding the origin of these important morphological structures.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Scale Molecular Gas Properties of the Antennae Merger: A Comparative Study with PHANGS-ALMA Galaxies and NGC 3256</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the central 9 kpc of the Antennae merger (NGC 4038/9) at 55 pc resolution in the CO 2-1 line obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We use a pixel-based analysis to compare the gas properties in the Antennae to those in 70 nearby spiral galaxies from the PHANGS-ALMA survey, as well as the merger and nearest luminous infrared galaxy NGC 3256. Compared to PHANGS galaxies at matched spatial resolution, the molecular gas in the Antennae exhibits some of the highest surface densities, velocity dispersions, peak brightness temperatures, and turbulent pressures. However, the virial parameters in the Antennae are consistent with many of the PHANGS galaxies. NGC 3256 has similar gas surface densities but higher nuclear velocity dispersions than the Antennae, as well as higher system-wide peak brightness temperatures and virial parameters. NGC 3256 is at a later stage in the merging process than the Antennae, which may result in more intense merger-driven gas flows that could drive up the turbulence in the gas. The high virial parameters in NGC 3256 may indicate that this increased turbulence is suppressing future star formation as NGC 3256 moves out of the starburst phase. In comparison, the relatively normal virial parameters in the Antennae may imply that it is about to undergo a new burst of star formation.</description>

      <title>DUVET: Resolved direct metallicity measurements in the outflow of starburst galaxy NGC 1569</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of direct-method metallicity measurements in the disk and outflow of the low-metallicity starburst galaxy NGC 1569. We use Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations to map the galaxy across 54$\arcsec$ (800 pc) along the major axis and 48$\arcsec$ (700 pc) along the minor axis with a spatial resolution of 1$\arcsec$ ($\sim$15 pc). We detect common strong emission lines ([\ion{O}{III}] $\lambda$5007, H$\beta$, [\ion{O}{II}] $\lambda$3727) and the fainter [\ion{O}{III}] $\lambda$4363 auroral line, which allows us to measure electron temperature ($T_e$) and metallicity. Theory suggests that outflows drive metals out of the disk driving observed trends between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. Our main result is that the metallicity in the outflow is similar to that of the disk, $Z_{\rm out} / Z_{\rm ISM} \approx 1$. This is consistent with previous absorption line studies in higher mass galaxies. Assumption of a mass-loading factor of $\dot{M}_{\rm out}/{\rm SFR}\sim3$ makes the metal-loading of NGC 1569 consistent with expectations derived from the mass-metallicity relationship. Our high spatial resolution metallicity maps reveal a region around a supermassive star cluster (SSC-B) with distinctly higher metallicity and higher electron density, compared to the disk. Given the known properties of SSC-B the higher metallicity and density of this region are likely the result of star formation-driven feedback acting on the local scale. Overall, our results are consistent with the picture in which metal-enriched winds pollute the circumgalactic medium surrounding galaxies, and thus connect the small-scale feedback processes to large-scale properties of galaxy halos.</description>

      <title>WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel (WISP) Survey: Photometric and Emission Line Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present reduced images and catalogues of photometric and emission line data ($\sim$230,000 and $\sim$8,000 sources, respectively) for the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel (WISP) Survey. These data are made publicly available on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) and include reduced images from various facilities: ground-based $ugri$, HST WFC3, and Spitzer IRAC (Infrared Array Camera). Coverage in at least one additional filter beyond the WFC3/IR data are available for roughly half of the fields (227 out of 483), with $\sim$20% (86) having coverage in six or more filters from $u$-band to IRAC 3.6$\mu$m (0.35-3.6$\mu$m). For the lower spatial resolution (and shallower) ground-based and IRAC data, we perform PSF-matched, prior-based, deconfusion photometry (i.e., forced-photometry) using the TPHOT software to optimally extract measurements or upper limits. We present the methodology and software used for the WISP emission line detection and visual inspection. The former adopts a continuous wavelet transformation that significantly reduces the number of spurious sources as candidates before the visual inspection stage. We combine both WISP catalogues and perform SED fitting on galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and multi-band photometry to measure their stellar masses. We stack WISP spectra as functions of stellar mass and redshift and measure average emission line fluxes and ratios. We find that WISP emission line sources are typically `normal' star-forming galaxies based on the Mass-Excitation diagram ([OIII]/H$\beta$ vs. $M_\star$; $0.74&lt;z_\mathrm{grism}&lt;2.31$), the galaxy main sequence (SFR vs. $M_\star$; $0.30&lt;z_\mathrm{grism}&lt;1.45$), $S_{32}$ ratio vs. $M_\star$ ($0.30&lt;z_\mathrm{grism}&lt;0.73$), and $O_{32}$ and $R_{23}$ ratios vs. $M_\star$ ($1.27&lt;z_\mathrm{grism}&lt;1.45$).</description>

      <title>Radio AGN Activity in Low Redshift Galaxies is Not Directly Related to Star Formation Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the demographics of radio-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the local universe as a function of host galaxy properties, most notably both stellar mass and star formation rate. Radio AGN activity is theoretically implicated in helping reduce star formation rates of galaxies, and therefore it is natural to investigate the relationship between these two galaxy properties. We use a sample of around 10, 000 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), along with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) radio survey and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS). There are 1,126 galaxies in MaNGA with radio detections. Using star formation rate and stellar mass estimates based on Pipe3D, inferred from the high signal-to-noise ratio measurements from MaNGA, we show that star formation rates are strongly correlated with 20 cm radio emission, as expected. We identify as radio AGN those radio emitters that are much stronger than expected from the star formation rate. Using this sample of AGN, the well-measured stellar velocity dispersions from MaNGA, and the black hole M-sigma relationship, we examine the Eddington ratio distribution and its dependence on stellar mass and star formation rate. We find that the Eddington ratio distribution depends strongly on stellar mass, with more massive galaxies having larger Eddington ratios. As found in previous studies, the AGN fraction increases rapidly with stellar mass. We do not find any dependence on star formation rate, specific star formation rate, or velocity dispersion when controlling for stellar mass. We conclude that galaxy star formation rates appear to be unrelated to the presence or absence of a radio AGN, which may be useful in constraining theoretical models of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties of the Southwest Outflow Streamer in the Starburst Galaxy NGC 253 with ALCHEMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical properties of galactic molecular outflows are important as they could constrain outflow formation mechanisms. We study the properties of the southwest (SW) outflow streamer including gas kinematics, optical depth, dense gas fraction, and shock strength in the central molecular zone of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. We image the molecular emission at a spatial resolution of $\sim$27 pc based on data from the ALCHEMI program. We trace the kinematics of molecular gas with CO(1-0) line. We constrain the optical depth of CO emission with CO/$^{13}$CO(1-0) ratio, the dense gas fraction with HCN/CO(1-0) ratio, as well as the shock strength with SiO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(1-0) ratio. The CO/$^{13}$CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratio is $\sim$21 in the SW streamer region, which approximates the C/$^{13}$C isotopic abundance ratio. The higher integrated intensity ratio compared to the disk can be attributed to the optically thinner environment for CO(1-0) emission inside the SW streamer. The HCN/CO(1-0) and SiO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratios both approach $\sim$0.2 in three giant molecular clouds (GMCs) at the base of the outflow streamers, which implies the higher dense gas fraction and enhanced strength of fast shocks in those GMCs than in the disk. The contours of those two integrated intensity ratios are extended towards the directions of outflow streamers, which connects the enhanced dense gas fraction and shock strength with molecular outflow. Moreover, the molecular gas with enhanced dense gas fraction and shock strength located at the base of the SW streamer shares the same velocity with the outflow. These phenomena suggest that the star formation inside the GMCs can trigger the shocks and further drive the molecular outflow.</description>

      <title>Impact of AGN feedback on the dynamics of gas; A Review across Diverse Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review examines the relationship between black hole activity and kinematic gas-star misalignment in brightest group galaxies (BGGs) with different merger rates. The formation history of galaxy groups is assessed through "age-dating" as an indicator of distinct major mergers involving the BGG. BGGs within groups characterized by a higher frequency of major mergers are more likely to host active SMBHs. A consistent correlation is identified between the level of black hole activity, as indicated by the 1.4 GHz and 325 MHz radio emissions, and the degree of kinematic misalignment between the gas and stellar components in BGGs. In dynamically fossil groups, where black hole accretion rate is relatively ($\sim 1$ dex) lower due to the lack of recent ( $\leq 1$ Gyr) major mergers, there is reduced ($\sim$ 30\%) misalignment between the gas and stellar components of BGGs compared to non-fossil groups. Additionally, the study reveals that BGGs in non-fossil groups show higher levels of star formation rate and increased occurrence of mergers, contributing to observed color differences. Exploring the properties and dynamics of the gas disc influenced by mechanical AGN feedback through hydrodynamic simulations suggests that AGN wind-induced effects further lead to persistent gas misalignment of the disk around the supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Katachi: Decoding the Imprints of Past Star Formation on Present Day Morphology in Galaxies with Interpretable CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical processes responsible for shaping how galaxies form and quench over time leave imprints on both the spatial (galaxy morphology) and temporal (star formation history; SFH) tracers that we use to study galaxies. While the morphology-SFR connection is well studied, the correlation with past star formation activity is not as well understood. To quantify this we present Katachi, an interpretable convolutional neural network (CNN) framework that learns the connection between the factors regulating star formation in galaxies on different spatial and temporal scales. Katachi is trained on 9904 galaxies at 0.02$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.1 in the SDSS-IV MaNGA DR17 sample to predict stellar mass (M$_*$; RMSE 0.22 dex), current star formation rate (SFR; RMSE 0.31 dex) and half-mass time (t$_{50}$; RMSE 0.23 dex). This information allows us to reconstruct non-parametric SFHs for each galaxy from \textit{gri} imaging alone. To quantify the morphological features informing the SFH predictions we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). We recover the expected trends of M$_*$ governed by the growth of galaxy bulges, and SFR correlating with spiral arms and other star-forming regions. We also find the SHAP maps of D4000 are more complex than those of M$_*$ and SFR, and that morphology is correlated with t$_{50}$ even at fixed mass and SFR. Katachi serves as a scalable public framework to predict galaxy properties from large imaging surveys including Rubin, Roman, and Euclid, with large datasets of high SNR imaging across limited photometric bands.</description>

      <title>The spin, expansion and contraction of open star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical constraints on the internal dynamics of open clusters are important for understanding their evolution and evaporation. High precision astrometry from Gaia DR3 are thus useful to observe aspects of the cluster dynamics. This work aims to identify dynamically peculiar clusters such as spinning and expanding clusters. We also quantify the spin frequency and expansion rate and compare them with $N$-body models to identify the origins of the peculiarities. We used the latest Gaia DR3 and archival spectroscopic surveys to analyse the radial velocities and proper motions of the cluster members in 1379 open clusters. A systematic analysis of synthetic clusters is performed to demonstrate the observability of the cluster spin along with effects of observational uncertainties. $N$-body simulations were used to understand the evolution of cluster spin and expansion for initially non-rotating clusters. We identified spin signatures in 10 clusters (and 16 candidates). Additionally, we detected expansion in 18 clusters and contraction in 3 clusters. The expansion rate is compatible with previous theoretical estimates based on expulsion of residual gas. The orientation of the spin axis is independent of the orbital angular momentum. The spin frequencies are much larger than what is expected from simulated initially non-rotating clusters. This indicates that &gt;1% of the clusters are born rotating and/or they have undergone strong interactions. Higher precision observations are required to increase the sample of such dynamically peculiar clusters and to characterise them.</description>

      <title>[CII] luminosity models and large-scale image cubes based on COSMOS 2020 and ALPINE-ALMA [CII] data back to the epoch of reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a novel method to create simulated [CII] emission line intensity mapping (LIM) data cubes using COSMOS 2020 galaxy catalog data. This allows us to provide solid lower limits for previous simulation-based model predictions and the expected signal strength of upcoming surveys. We applied [CII]158$\mu$m luminosity models to COSMOS 2020 to create LIM cubes that cover 1.2$\times$1.2 deg$^2$ sky area. These models are derived using galaxy bulk property data from the ALPINE-ALMA survey over the redshift range 4.4&lt;$z$&lt;5.9, and other models are taken from the literature. The LIM cubes cover 3.42&lt;$z$&lt;3.87, 4.14&lt;$z$&lt;4.76, 5.34&lt;$z$&lt;6.31, and 6.75&lt;$z$&lt;8.27, matched to planned observations from the EoR-Spec module of the Prime-Cam instrument in the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST). We also created predictions including additional galaxies by "extrapolating" from the faint end of the COSMOS 2020 luminosity function, comparing these to predictions from the literature which included signal below current detection limits. In addition, we computed signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios for the power spectra, using parameters from the planned FYST survey with predicted instrumental noise levels. We find lower limits for the expected power spectrum using the likely incomplete empirical data: when normalised by 2{\pi}$^2$, the amplitudes at $k$ = 1 Mpc$^{-1}$ are 3.06$\times$10$^7$, 1.43$\times$10$^7$, 9.80$\times$10$^5$, 2.77$\times$10$^5$ (Jy sr$^{-1}$)$^2$ for the aforementioned redshift ranges. For the extrapolated sample, the power spectra are consistent with prior predictions, indicating that extrapolation is viable for creating mock catalogs. In this case we expect S/N&gt;1 when using FYST parameters. However, our high redshift results remain inconclusive because of the poor completeness of COSMOS 2020 at $z$&gt;6.3. These predictions will be improved based on future JWST data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to study both the Interstellar Medium (ISM) and the young stellar population in the three star-forming regions, namely IRAS 05137+3919, 05168+3634, and 19110+1045. The study of the ISM includes determination of the hydrogen column density (N(H_2)) and dust temperature (T_d) in the regions using Modified blackbody fitting. The main parameters of identified and classified young stellar objects (YSOs) belonging to the regions were determined comparing with the radiation transfer models. We also constructed a colour-magnitude diagram to compare the parameters of the YSOs with the results of the radiative transfer models. The three stellar populations appear to have formed under different scenarios. In the cases of IRAS 05137+3919 and IRAS 05168+3634, the age spread is considerably wider, suggesting that the stellar population likely emerged from independent condensations. In contrast, the third region comprises a pair of ultra-compact HII regions (UCHIIs), G45.12+0.13 and G45.07+0.13, with a notably smaller age spread. This hints at the possibility that these clusters originated from a single triggering event.</description>

      <title>The $\kappa$-model under test of the SPARC database</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main goal is here to make a comparative analysis between the well-known MOND theory and a more recent model called$\kappa$-model. An additional connection, between the $\kappa$-model and twoother novel MOND-type theories: Newtonian Fractional-DimensionGravity (NFDG) and Refracted Gravity (RG), is likewise presented.All these models are built to overtake the DM paradigm, or at leastto strongly reduce the dark matter content. Whereas they rely ondifferent formalisms, however, all four seem to suggest that the universal parameter, a0, appearing in MOND theory could intrinsicallybe correlated to either the sole baryonic mean mass density (RG and$\kappa$-model) and/or to the dimension of the object under consideration(NFDG and $\kappa$-model). We could then confer to the parameter a0 amore flexible status of multiscale parameter, as required to explainthe dynamics together in galaxies and in galaxy clusters. Eventually,the conformal gravity theory (CFT) also seems to have some remotelink with the $\kappa$-model, even though the first one is an extension ofgeneral relativity, and the second one is Newtonian in essence. The$\kappa$-model has been tested on a small sample of spiral galaxies and ingalaxy clusters. Now we test this model on a large sample of galaxiesissued from the SPARC database.</description>

      <title>Differential reddening in 48 globular clusters: An end to the quest for the intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, it has been theorized that a tenuous but detectable intracluster medium should be present in globular clusters, which is continuously replenished by the gas and dust ejected by bright giants and periodically cleared by interactions with the Galactic disk. However, dedicated searches, especially in infrared and radio wavelengths, have returned mostly upper limits, which are lower than theoretical expectations by several orders of magnitude. We profited from recent wide-field photometry for 48 Galactic globular clusters to compute high-resolution maps of differential reddening, which can be used to correct any photometric catalog in these areas for reddening variations. Using 3D reddening maps from the literature, we evaluated the amount of foreground extinction. This allowed us to estimate the masses of the intracluster medium in our sample clusters, with an accuracy of one order of magnitude. Our estimates agree with the few available literature detections and with theoretical expectations. Because the discrepancy between observations and expectations only concerns literature upper limits, we explored possible reasons why they could be underestimated and we show that two recent discoveries can explain the discrepancy. The first is the recent discovery that the intracluster medium in 47 Tuc is not centrally concentrated. This is also supported by our maps, which in the majority of cases do not show a central reddening concentration. The second is the discovery that the dust in metal-poor ([Fe/H] less than about -1 dex) globular clusters is dominated by iron grains rather than silicates, which undermines previous dust mass estimates from observed upper limits. We conclude that current evidence, including our maps, does not contradict theoretical expectations and the problem of the missing intracluster medium is no longer an issue.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of the Ground State Transitions of CO and [C I] as Molecular Gas Tracers at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CO(1--0) and [\ion{C}{1}](1--0) emission lines are well-established tracers of cold molecular gas mass in local galaxies. At high redshift, where the interstellar medium (ISM) is likely to be denser, there have been limited direct comparisons of both ground state transitions. Here we present a study of CO(1--0) and [\ion{C}{1}](1--0) emission in a sample of 20 unlensed dusty, star-forming galaxies at $z=2-5$. The CO(1--0)/[\ion{C}{1}](1--0) ratio is constant up to at least $z=5$, supporting the use of [CI](1-0) as a gas mass tracer. PDR modelling of the available data indicates a median H$_2$ density of log$(n~[$cm$^{-3}])=4.7\pm0.2$, and UV radiation field log$(G_{\mathrm{UV}} [G$_0$])=3.2\pm0.2$. We use the CO(1--0), [\ion{C}{1}](1--0) and 3mm dust continuum measurements to cross--calibrate the respective gas mass conversion factors, finding no dependence of these factors on either redshift or infrared luminosity. Assuming a variable CO conversion factor then implies [\ion{C}{1}] and dust conversion factors that differ from canonically assumed values but are consistent with the solar/super-solar metallicities expected for our sources. Radiative transfer modelling shows that the warmer CMB at high redshift can significantly affect the [\ion{C}{1}] as well as CO emission, which can change the derived molecular gas masses by up to 70\% for the coldest kinetic gas temperatures expected. Nevertheless, we show that the magnitude of the effect on the ratio of the tracers is within the known scatter of the $L'_\mathrm{CO}-L'_\mathrm{[CI]}$ relation. Further determining the absolute decrease of individual line intensities will require well-sampled spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) to model the gas excitation conditions in more detail.</description>

      <title>eDIG-CHANGES II: Project Design and Initial Results on NGC 3556</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) represents ionized gases traced by optical/UV lines beyond the stellar extent of galaxies. We herein introduce a novel multi-slit narrow-band spectroscopy method to conduct spatially resolved spectroscopy of the eDIG around a sample of nearby edge-on disk galaxies (eDIG-CHANGES). In this paper, we introduce the project design and major scientific goals, as well as a pilot study of NGC 3556 (M108). The eDIG is detected to a vertical extent of a few kpc above the disk, comparable to the X-ray and radio images. We do not see significant vertical variation of the [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio. A rough examination of the pressure balance between different circum-galactic medium (CGM) phases indicates the magnetic field is in a rough pressure balance with the X-ray emitting hot gas, and may play an important role in the global motion of both the eDIG and the hot gas in the lower halo. At the location of an HST/COS observed UV bright background AGN $\sim29\rm~kpc$ from the center of NGC 3556, the magnetic pressure is much lower than that of the hot gas and the ionized gas traced by UV absorption lines, although the extrapolation of the pressure profiles may cause some biases in this comparison. By comparing the position-velocity diagrams of the optical and CO lines, we also find the dynamics of the two gas phases are consistent with each other, with no evidence of a global inflow/outflow and a maximum rotation velocity of $\sim150\rm~km~s^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The persistence of high altitude non-equilibrium diffuse ionized gas in simulations of star forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widespread, high altitude, diffuse ionized gas with scale heights of around a kiloparsec is observed in the Milky Way and other star forming galaxies. Numerical radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium show that gas can be driven to high altitudes above the galactic midplane, but the degree of ionization is often less than inferred from observations. For computational expediency, ionizing radiation from massive stars is often included as a post-processing step assuming ionization equilibrium. We extend our simulations of a Milky Way-like interstellar medium to include the combined effect of supernovae and photoionization feedback from midplane OB stars and a population of hot evolved low mass stars. The diffuse ionized gas has densities below 0.1 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, so recombination timescales can exceed millions of years. Our simulations now follow the time-dependent ionization and recombination of low density gas. The long recombination timescales result in diffuse ionized gas that persists at large altitudes long after the deaths of massive stars that produce the vast majority of the ionized gas. The diffuse ionized gas does not exhibit the large variability inherent in simulations that adopt ionization equilibrium. The vertical distribution of neutral and ionized gas is close to what is observed in the Milky Way. The volume filling factor of ionised gas increases with altitude resulting in the scale height of free electrons being larger than that inferred from H$\alpha$ emission, thus reconciling the observations of ionized gas made in H$\alpha$ and from pulsar dispersion measurements.</description>

      <title>Dark matter free dwarf galaxy formation at the the tips of the tentacles of jellyfish galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When falling into a galaxy cluster, galaxies experience a loss of gas due to ram pressure stripping. In particular, disk galaxies lose gas from their disks and very large tentacles of gas can be formed. Because of the morphology of these stripped galaxies they have been referred to as Jellyfish galaxies. It has been found that star formation is triggered not only in the disk, but also in the tentacles of such Jellyfish galaxies. The observed star forming regions located in the tentacles of those galaxies have been found to be as massive as $3\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and with sizes $&gt; 100$ pc. Interestingly, these parameters in mass and size agree with those of dwarf galaxies. In this work we make use of the state of the art magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Illustris TNG-50, to study massive jellyfish galaxies with long tentacles. We find that, in the tentacles of TNG-50 Jellyfish galaxies, the star formation regions (gas+stars) formed could be as massive as $\sim2\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$. A particular star forming region was analyzed. This region has a star formation rate of $0.04$ M$_{\odot}$/yr, it is metal rich, has an average age of $0.46$ Gyr, and has a half mass radius of $\sim1$ kpc, typical of standard dwarf galaxies. Most importantly, this region is gravitationally self-bound. All and all, we identify a new type of dwarf galaxy being born from the gas tentacles of jellyfish galaxies, that by construction lacks a dark matter (hereafter DM) halo.</description>

      <title>Efficient formation of a massive quiescent galaxy at redshift 4.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, suggested by recent observations, appears to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift $z=4.896$, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the galaxy's stellar mass of $10^{10.9}\,M_\odot$, corroborated by the mass implied by its gas kinematics, formed in a short $340\,$Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than currently assumed.</description>

      <title>JADES: Primeval Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies reveal early sites of reionisation out to redshift $z \sim 9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Given the sensitivity of the resonant Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ (Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$) transition to absorption by neutral hydrogen, observations of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) have been widely used to probe the ionising capabilities of reionisation-era galaxies and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, prior to JWST our understanding of the contribution of fainter sources and of ionised `bubbles' at earlier stages of reionisation remained uncertain. Here, we present the characterisation of three exceptionally distant LAEs at $z&gt;8$, newly discovered by JWST/NIRSpec in the JADES survey. These three similarly bright ($M_\text{UV} \approx -20\,\mathrm{mag}$) LAEs exhibit small Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ velocity offsets from the systemic redshift, $\Delta v_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} \lesssim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, yet span a range of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ equivalent widths ($15\,\AA$, $31\,\AA$, and $132\,\AA$). The former two show moderate Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escape fractions ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 10\%$), whereas Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escapes remarkably efficiently from the third ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 71\%$), which moreover is very compact (half-light radius of $90\pm10\,\mathrm{pc}$). We find these LAEs are low-mass galaxies dominated by very recent, vigorous bursts of star formation accompanied by strong nebular emission from metal-poor gas. We infer the two LAEs with modest $f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha}$, one of which reveals evidence for ionisation by an active galactic nucleus, may have reasonably produced small ionised bubbles preventing complete IGM absorption of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$. The third, however, requires a $\sim 3\,\text{physical Mpc}$ bubble, indicating faint galaxies have contributed significantly. The most distant LAEs thus continue to be powerful observational probes into the earlier stages of reionisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the large spectroscopic data set of the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field survey to investigate the kinematics and energetics of ionised gas outflows. Using a sample of 598 star-forming galaxies at redshift 1.4 &lt; $z$ &lt; 3.8, we decompose $\rm{H}\alpha$ and [OIII] emission lines into narrow and broad components, finding significant detections of broad components in 10% of the sample. The ionised outflow velocity from individual galaxies appears independent of galaxy properties, such as stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and star-formation-rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). Adopting a simple outflow model, we estimate the mass-, energy- and momentum-loading factors of the ionised outflows, finding modest values with averages of 0.33, 0.04, and 0.22, respectively. The larger momentum- than energy-loading factors, for the adopted physical parameters, imply that these ionised outflows are primarily momentum-driven. We further find a marginal correlation (2.5$\sigma$) between the mass-loading factor and stellar mass in agreement with predictions by simulations, scaling as $\eta_{m}$ $\propto M_{\star}^{-0.45}$. This shallow scaling relation is consistent with these ionised outflows being driven by a combination of mechanical energy generated by supernovae explosions and radiation pressure acting on dusty material. In a majority of galaxies, the outflowing material does not appear to have sufficient velocity to escape the gravitational potential of their host, likely recycling back at later times. Together, these results suggest that the ionised outflows traced by nebular emission lines are negligible, with the bulk of mass and energy carried out in other gaseous phases.</description>

      <title>Kerr-scalaron metric and astronomical consequences near the Galactic Center black hole</title>

Abstract: Astronomical tests of spacetime metric and gravitation theory near the Galactic Center (GC) black hole, Sgr A* have gained momentum with the observations of compact stellar orbits near the black hole and measurement of the black hole shadow. Deviation from the Kerr metric is a potential signature of modified gravity theory. In this work, we use Newman-Janis algorithm to construct an axially symmetric and asymptotically flat metric in f(R) scalaron gravity theory. We call it as Kerr-scalaron metric. For studying astronomical consequences of the new metric we use the compact stellar orbits and the black hole shadow. We use the observed size of the emission ring of the GC black hole shadow for estimating deviation of the new metric from general relativity. It has been found that scalarons with mass within $10^{-17}$ eV - $10^{-16}$ eV are compatible with the observed emission ring size for black hole spin $\chi=0.9$. Schwarzschild limit of the pericenter shift is estimated for compact stellar orbits near the black hole. General relativistic pericenter shift in wider orbits including S-stars such as S4716 and S2 has been reproduced with these scalarons. The parameter $f_{SP}$ measuring deviation from Schwarzschild pericenter shift has been found as $f_{SP}=1.00-1.04$ within stellar orbits having semi-major axes $45$ au - $100$ au. Scalarons have the capability to dominate Schwarzschild precession for orbits much below $45$ au. Lense-Thirring (LT) precession with the new metric is estimated for the compact orbits. The massive scalarons produce LT precession with magnitude ($12.25-24.5$) $\mu$as/yr in the orbit of S2. The LT precession time scale is within $0.1$% of the age of the S-stars.</description>

      <title>Substructures within Substructures in the Complex Post-Merging System A514 Unveiled by High-Resolution Magellan/Megacam Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abell 514 (A514) at $z=0.071$ is an intriguing merging system exhibiting highly elongated (~1 Mpc) X-ray features and three large-scale (300~500 kpc) bent radio jets. To dissect this system with its multi-wavelength data, it is critical to robustly identify and quantify its dark matter (DM) substructures. We present a weak-lensing analysis of A514 using deep Magellan/Megacam observations. Combining two optical band filter imaging data obtained under optimal seeing (~0.''6) and leveraging the proximity of A514, we achieve a high source density of ~$46\mbox{arcmin}^{-2}$ or ~$\mathrm{6940Mpc^{-2}}$, which enables high-resolution mass reconstruction. We unveil the complex DM substructures of A514, which are characterized by the NW and SE subclusters separated by ~$0.7$Mpc, each exhibiting a bimodal mass distribution. The total mass of the NW subcluster is estimated to be $\mathrm{M^{NW}_{200c} = 1.08_{-0.22}^{+0.24} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}}$ and is further resolved into the eastern ($\mathrm{M^{NW_E}_{200c} = 2.6_{-1.1}^{+1.4} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}})$ and western ($\mathrm{M^{NW_W}_{200c} = 7.1_{-2.0}^{+2.3} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}}$) components. The mass of the SE subcluster is $\mathrm{M^{SE}_{200c} = 1.55_{-0.26}^{+0.28} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}}$, which is also further resolved into the northern ($\mathrm{M^{SE_N}_{200c} = 2.9_{-1.3}^{+1.8} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}}$) and southern ($\mathrm{M^{SE_S}_{200c} = 8.5_{-2.6}^{+3.0} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}}$) components. These four substructures coincide with the A514 brightest galaxies and are detected with significances ranging from 3.4$\sigma$ to 4.8$\sigma$. Comparison of the dark matter substructures with the X-ray distribution suggests that A514 might have experienced an off-axis collision, and the NW and SE subclusters are currently near their apocenters.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation from Ly$\alpha$ forest in Fourier space using Information Maximising Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to present a robust parameter estimation with simulated Lya forest spectra from Sherwood-Relics simulations suite using Information Maximizing Neural Network(IMNN) to extract maximal information from Lya 1D-transmitted flux in Fourier space. We perform 1D estimations using IMNN for IGM thermal parameters $T_0$ &amp; $\gamma$ at z=2-4 and cosmological parameters $\sigma_8$ &amp; $n_s$ at z=3-4. We compare our results with estimates from power spectrum using posterior distribution from Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC). We then check robustness of IMNN estimates against deviation in spectral noise levels,continuum uncertainties &amp; instrumental smoothing effects. Using mock Lya forest sightlines from publicly available CAMELS project we also check the robustness of the trained IMNN on a different simulation. We also perform a 2D-parameter estimation for $T_0$ &amp; HI photoionization rates $\Gamma_{HI}$. We obtain improved estimates of $T_0$ &amp; $\gamma$ using IMNN over standard MCMC approach. These estimates are also more robust against SNR deviations at z=2 &amp; 3. At z=4 the sensitivity to noise deviations is on par with MCMC estimates. The IMNN also provides $T_0$ and $\gamma$ estimates which are robust against continuum uncertainties by extracting continuum-independent small-scale information from Fourier domain. In case of $\sigma_8$ &amp; $n_s$ IMNN performs on par with MCMC but still offers a significant speed boost in estimating parameters from a new dataset. The improved estimates with IMNN are seen for high instrumental-resolution(FWHM=6km/s). At medium or low resolutions IMNN performs similar to MCMC suggesting an improved extraction of small-scale information with IMNN. We also find that IMNN estimates are robust against the choice of simulation. By performing a 2D-parameter estimation for $T_0$ &amp; $\Gamma_{HI}$ we also demonstrate how to take forward this approach observationally in the future.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Content of the Young Open Cluster Berkeley 50 (IC 1310)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observed the Galactic open cluster Berkeley 50 in order to determine its stellar content, distance, and age. We obtained UBV photometry of 1145 stars in a 12.3' $\times$ 12.3' field, and used Gaia proper motions and parallaxes to identify 64 members, of which we obtained spectra of the 17 brightest members. The majority of the observed population we classified as B dwarfs, with the exception of a newly identified red supergiant star, which our spectroscopy shows has a B-type companion. Our study establishes the distance as 3.8 kpc, with an average color-excess $E(B-V)=0.9$. Comparison of the physical properties of the cluster with the Geneva evolutionary tracks places the age of the cluster as 50-60 Myr, with its most massive members being $\sim7M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Constraining free-free emission and photoevaporative mass loss rates for known proplyds and new VLA-identified candidate proplyds in NGC 1977</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations covering the NGC 1977 region at 3.0, 6.4, and 15.0 GHz. We search for compact radio sources and detect continuum emission from 34 NGC 1977 cluster members and 37 background objects. Of the 34 radio-detected cluster members, 3 are associated with known proplyds in NGC 1977, 22 are associated with additional young stellar objects in NGC 1977, and 9 are newly-identified cluster members. We examine the radio spectral energy distributions, circular polarization, and variability of the detected NGC 1977 sources, and identify 10 new candidate proplyds whose radio fluxes are dominated by optically thin free-free emission. We use measurements of free-free emission to calculate the mass-loss rates of known proplyds and new candidate proplyds in NGC 1977, and find values $\sim10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which are lower than the mass-loss rates measured towards proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster, but consistent with the mass-loss rates predicted by external photoevaporation models for spatially-extended disks that are irradiated by the typical external UV fields encountered in NGC 1977. Finally, we show that photoevaporative disk winds in NGC 1977 may be illuminated by internal or external sources of ionization, depending on their positions within the cluster. This study provides new constraints on disk properties in a clustered star-forming region with a weaker UV environment than the Orion Nebula Cluster, but a stronger UV environment than low-mass star-forming regions like Taurus. Such intermediate UV environments represent the typical conditions of Galactic star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Galaxy 3D Shape Recovery using Mixture Density Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the turn of the century, astronomers have been exploiting the rich information afforded by combining stellar kinematic maps and imaging in an attempt to recover the intrinsic, three-dimensional (3D) shape of a galaxy. A common intrinsic shape recovery method relies on an expected monotonic relationship between the intrinsic misalignment of the kinematic and morphological axes and the triaxiality parameter. Recent studies have, however, cast doubt about underlying assumptions relating shape and intrinsic kinematic misalignment. In this work, we aim to recover the 3D shape of individual galaxies using their projected stellar kinematic and flux distributions using a supervised machine learning approach with mixture density network (MDN). Using a mock dataset of the EAGLE hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, we train the MDN model for a carefully selected set of common kinematic and photometric parameters. Compared to previous methods, we demonstrate potential improvements achieved with the MDN model to retrieve the 3D galaxy shape along with the uncertainties, especially for prolate and triaxial systems. We make specific recommendations for recovering galaxy intrinsic shapes relevant for current and future integral field spectroscopic galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>The particle acceleration study in blazar jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle acceleration of blazar jets is crucial to high-energy astrophysics, yet the acceleration mechanism division in blazar subclasses and the underlying nature of these mechanisms remain elusive. In this work, we utilized the synchrotron spectral information (synchrotron peak frequency, $\log \nu_{\rm sy}$, and corresponding curvature, $b_{\rm sy}$) of 2705 blazars from the literature and studied the subject of particle acceleration in blazar jets by analysing the correlation between $\log \nu_{\rm sy}$ and $1/b_{\rm sy}$. Our results suggested that the entire sample follows an energy-dependent probability acceleration (EDPA). Specifically, the low inverse Compton peak sources (LCPs) follow the mechanism that fluctuations of fractional gain acceleration (FFGA), while the high inverse Compton peak sources (HCPs) follow an acceleration mechanism of EDPA. Our results indicated that the separation between LCPs and HCPs results from the electron peak Lorentz factor ($\gamma_{\rm p}$), and the differentiation should originate from different acceleration mechanisms. Moreover, our study revealed a transition in the acceleration mechanism from FFGA to EDPA around $\log \nu_{\rm sy} \sim 15$ through a detailed analysis of binned-$\log \nu_{\rm sy}$. The mechanism of FFGA dominates the particle acceleration in LCP jets because of stronger jets and the EDPA dominates the particle energy gain in the HCPs due to a more efficient acceleration process.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Radio Emissions from Accretion Disk Winds in Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the origins of radio emissions from radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGNs) remains a pivotal challenge in astrophysics. One potential source of this radiation is the shock interaction between AGN disk winds and the interstellar medium (ISM). To understand this phenomenon, we construct a spherical, one-zone, and self-similar expansion model of shock structure between ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) and the ISM. We then calculate the energy density distribution of non-thermal electrons by solving the transport equation, considering diffusive shock acceleration as the acceleration mechanism and synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling as the cooling mechanisms. Based on the derived energy distribution of non-thermal electrons, we model the radio synchrotron spectrum of shocked ISM. For the 15 nearby RQ AGNs hosting UFOs, we investigate shocked ISM parameters required to model their observed radio spectra, based on X-ray observations and measured UFO velocities. Radio spectra of 11 out of 15 nearby RQ AGNs would be explained by the AGN disk wind model. This is a compelling indication that shock interactions between AGN disk winds and the ISM could indeed be the source of their radio emissions. The typical predicted source size and magnetic field strength are several $100$ pc and $0.1$ mG, respectively. We also discuss whether our prediction can be tested by future radio observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the MMRD Relation for Novae in M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The results of a two decade long $R$-band photometric survey of novae in M31 are presented. From these data, $R$-band light curves have been determined for 180 novae with data sufficient for estimating peak brightness and subsequent rate of decline. The data show a weak correlation of peak brightness with fade rate consistent with the well-known Maximum Magnitude versus Rate of Decline (MMRD) relation. As generally appreciated for Galactic novae, the large scatter in the MMRD relation precludes its use in determining distances to individual novae. The novae at maximum light are distributed with standard deviation $\sigma=0.89$ mag about a mean $R$-band absolute magnitude given by $\langle M_R \rangle=-7.57\pm0.07$. The overall M31 luminosity distribution is in excellent agreement with that found for Galactic novae suggesting that the nova populations in M31 and the Galaxy are quite similar. The notion that all novae can be characterized by a standard luminosity 15 d after maximum light ($M_{15}$) is also explored. Surprisingly, the distribution of $M_{15}$ values is characterized by a standard deviation only slightly smaller than that for novae at maximum light and thus offers little promise for precise extragalactic distance determinations. A dozen faint and fast novae that are likely to be previously unidentified recurrent novae have been identified from their position in the MMRD plot and in the $M_{15}$ distribution.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <title>Gaia21blx: Complete resolution of a binary microlensing event in the Galactic disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Gravitational microlensing is a method that is used to discover planet-hosting systems at distances of several kiloparsec in the Galactic disk and bulge. We present the analysis of a microlensing event reported by the Gaia photometric alert team that might have a bright lens. Aims. In order to infer the mass and distance to the lensing system, the parallax measurement at the position of Gaia21blx was used. In this particular case, the source and the lens have comparable magnitudes and we cannot attribute the parallax measured by Gaia to the lens or source alone. Methods. Since the blending flux is important, we assumed that the Gaia parallax is the flux-weighted average of the parallaxes of the lens and source. Combining this assumption with the information from the microlensing models and the finite source effects we were able to resolve all degeneracies and thus obtained the mass, distance, luminosities and projected kinematics of the binary lens and the source. Results. According to the best model, the lens is a binary system at $2.18 \pm 0.07$ kpc from Earth. It is composed of a G star with $0.95\pm 0.17\,M_{\odot}$ and a K star with $0.53 \pm 0.07 \, M_{\odot}$. The source is likely to be an F subgiant star at $2.38 \pm 1.71$ kpc with a mass of $1.10 \pm 0.18 \, M_{\odot}$. Both lenses and the source follow the kinematics of the thin-disk population. We also discuss alternative models, that are disfavored by the data or by prior expectations, however.</description>

      <title>Thermal Structure Determines Kinematics: Vertical Shear Instability in Stellar Irradiated Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is crucial for protoplanetary disk dynamics, and Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism in outer disk regions to generate turbulence. We use Athena++ radiation module to study VSI in full and transition disks, accounting for radiation transport and stellar irradiation. We find that the thermal structure and cooling timescale significantly influence VSI behavior. The inner rim location and radial optical depth affect disk kinematics. Compared with previous vertically-isothermal simulations, our full disk and transition disks with small cavities have a superheated atmosphere and cool midplane with long cooling timescales, which suppresses the corrugation mode and the associated meridional circulation. This temperature structure also produces a strong vertical shear at $\mathrm{\tau_*}$ = 1, producing an outgoing flow layer at $\tau_* &lt; 1$ on top of an ingoing flow layer at $\tau_* \sim 1$. The midplane becomes less turbulent, while the surface becomes more turbulent with effective $\alpha$ reaching $\sim10^{-2}$ at $\tau_* \lesssim$1. This large surface stress drives significant surface accretion, producing substructures. Using temperature and cooling time measured/estimated from radiation-hydro simulations, we demonstrate that less computationally-intensive simulations incorporating simple orbital cooling can almost reproduce radiation-hydro results. By generating synthetic images, we find that substructures are more pronounced in disks with larger cavities. The higher velocity dispersion at the gap edge could also slow particle settling. Both properties are consistent with recent Near-IR and ALMA observations. Our simulations predict that regions with significant temperature changes are accompanied by significant velocity changes, which can be tested by ALMA kinematics/chemistry observations.</description>

      <title>The neutrino background from non-jetted active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We calculate the contribution to the neutrino background from the non-jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) population following the recent IceCube association of TeV neutrinos with NGC 1068. Methods. We exploit our robust knowledge of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and evolution and convert it to the neutrino band by using NGC 1068 as a benchmark and a theoretically motivated neutrino spectrum. Results. The resulting neutrino background up to redshift 5 does not violate either the IceCube diffuse flux or the upper bounds for non-jetted AGN, although barely so. This is consistent with a scenario where the latter class makes a substantial contribution mostly below 1 PeV, while jetted AGN, i.e. blazars, dominate above this energy, in intriguing agreement with the dip in the neutrino data at ~ 300 TeV. More and better IceCube data on Seyfert galaxies will allow us to constrain the fraction of neutrino emitters among non-jetted AGN.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Bar Pattern Speed using Hercules and Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distribution of moving groups in the solar neighborhood has been used to constrain dynamical properties of the Milky Way for decades. The kinematic bimodality between the main mode (Hyades, Pleiades, Coma Berenices, and Sirius) and Hercules can be explained by two different bar models -- via the outer Lindblad resonance of a bar with a high pattern speed ($\sim$55 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$), or via the corotation resonance of a bar with a low pattern speed ($\sim$40 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$). Recent works directly studying the kinematics of bar stars and gas flows near the center of the Galaxy have converged on the low pattern speed model. In this paper, we independently confirm this result by using Gaia DR3 to directly study the variation of Hercules across Galactic azimuth. We find that Hercules increases in $V_\phi$ and becomes stronger as we move towards the minor axis of the bar, and decreases in $V_\phi$ and becomes weaker as we move towards the major axis of the bar. This is in direct agreement with theoretical predictions of a low pattern speed bar model in which Hercules is formed by the corotation resonance with stars orbiting the bar's L4/L5 Lagrange points.</description>

      <title>Spectral Libraries for Analyzing Spectra of Low-Metalicity Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a set of isochrone-tailored spectral libraries for analyzing composite spectra of low-metallicity massive star clusters or starburst galaxies. Specifically, we have computed non-LTE spectra for stars of all initial masses for isochrones at metallicities, Z=0.006, 0.002,and 0.0004, with and without considering rotation. These isochrones were constructed by the Geneva group (Ekstr\"{o}m et al., 2011; Georgy et al., 2013; Groh et al., 2019; Eggenberger et al. 2020). We also present a Python program for integrating individual spectra for an arbitrary initial mass function.</description>

      <title>The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public Near-Infrared Slitless Survey Epoch 1 (NGDEEP-NISS1): Extra-Galactic Star-formation and Active Galactic Nuclei at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) survey program was designed specifically to include Near Infrared Slitless Spectroscopic observations (NGDEEP-NISS) to detect multiple emission lines in as many galaxies as possible and across a wide redshift range using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). We present early results obtained from the the first set of observations (Epoch 1, 50$\%$ of the allocated orbits) of this program (NGDEEP-NISS1). Using a set of independently developed calibration files designed to deal with a complex combination of overlapping spectra, multiple position angles, and multiple cross filters and grisms, in conjunction with a robust and proven algorithm for quantifying contamination from overlapping dispersed spectra, NGDEEP-NISS1 has achieved a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity limit of 2 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. We demonstrate the power of deep wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) to characterize the star-formation rates, and metallicity ([OIII]/H$\beta$), and dust content, of galaxies at $1&lt;z&lt;3.5$. The latter showing intriguing initial results on the applicability and assumptions made regarding the use of Case B recombination.
  Further, we identify the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and infer the mass of their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using broadened restframe MgII and H$\beta$ emission lines. The spectroscopic results are then compared with the physical properties of galaxies extrapolated from fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to photometry alone. The results clearly demonstrate the unique power and efficiency of WFSS at near-infrared wavelengths over other methods to determine the properties of galaxies across a broad range of redshifts.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Structures in COSMOS2020: Evolution of Star Formation Activity in Different Environments at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study the role of environment in galaxy evolution, we reconstruct the underlying density field of galaxies based on COSMOS2020 (The Farmer catalog) and provide the density catalog for a magnitude limited ($K_{s}&lt;24.5$) sample of $\sim 210 \, k$ galaxies at $0.4&lt;z&lt;5$ within the COSMOS field. The environmental densities are calculated using weighted Kernel Density Estimation (wKDE) approach with the choice of von Mises-Fisher kernel, an analog of the Gaussian kernel for periodic data. Additionally, we make corrections for the edge effect and masked regions in the field. We utilize physical properties extracted by LePhare to investigate the connection between star formation activity and the environmental density of galaxies in six mass-complete sub-samples at different cosmic epochs within $0.4&lt;z&lt;4$. Our findings confirm a strong anti-correlation between star formation rate (SFR)/specific SFR (sSFR) and environmental density out to $z \sim 1.1$. At $1.1&lt;z&lt;2$, there is no significant correlation between SFR/sSFR and density. At $2&lt;z&lt;4$ we observe a reversal of the SFR/sSFR-density relation such that both SFR and sSFR increase by a factor of $\sim 10$ with increasing density contrast, $\delta$, from -0.4 to 5. This observed reversal at higher redshifts supports the scenario where an increased availability of gas supply, along with tidal interactions and a generally higher star formation efficiency in dense environments, could potentially enhance star formation activity in galaxies located in rich environments at $z&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Is GN-z11 powered by a super-Eddington massive black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of $z \sim 6$ quasars powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8-10}\, M_\odot$) challenge our current understanding of early black hole (BH) formation and evolution. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the study of massive BHs (MBHs; $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^{6-7} \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$) up to $z\sim 11$, thus bridging the properties of $z\sim 6$ quasars to their ancestors. The JWST spectroscopic observations of GN-z11, a well-known $z=10.6$ star-forming galaxy, have been interpreted with the presence of a super-Eddington (Eddington ratio $\equiv \,\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim 5.5$) accreting MBH. To test this hypothesis, we used a zoom-in cosmological simulation of galaxy formation and BH co-evolution. We first tested the simulation results against the observed probability distribution function (PDF) of $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ found in $z\sim 6$ quasars. Then, in the simulation we selected the BHs that satisfy the following criteria: (a) $10 &lt; z &lt; 11 $, (b) $M_{\rm BH} &gt; 10^6 \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Next, we apply the extreme value statistics to the PDF of $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ resulting from the simulation and we find that the probability of observing a $z\sim 10-11$ MBH accreting with $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 5.5$ in the volume surveyed by JWST is very low ($&lt;0.2\%$). We compared our predictions with those in the literature, and discuss the main limitations of our work. Our simulation cannot explain the JWST observations of GN-z11. This might be due to (i) poor resolution and statistics in simulations, (ii) simplistic sub-grid models (e.g. BH accretion and seeding), (iii) uncertainties in the data analysis and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the collision scenario of the dissociative galaxy cluster Abell 56 through hydrodynamic simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In galaxy cluster collisions, the gas can be separated from dark matter halos. Abell~56 displays signatures of a dissociative bullet-like merger with a possible high inclination angle between the plane of orbit and the sky. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive description of the features observed in the collision scenario of Abell~56. Additionally, we aim to apply a potential weak lensing mass bias correction attributed to the merger to evaluate its impact on our findings. To investigate this, we perform tailored hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations, varying the impact parameter. We initially identified an early scenario at $0.12$\,Gyr after the central passage that reproduces some observational features. However, the mean temperature of $9.7$\,keV exceeded the observed value. Our best model corresponds to the late scenario at $0.52$\,Gyr after the pericenter, reproducing observed features of Abell~56, with an inclination of $58^\circ$. These features include the offset of $103$\,kpc between the main gas density peak and the south dark matter density peak, gas morphology, a line of sight relative velocity of $184$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, and a mean temperature of $6.7$\,keV. This late model provides a plausible scenario to describe the dynamics of Abell~56. The weak lensing mass bias did not significantly impact the overall dynamics of this cluster merger.</description>

      <title>Cloud-by-cloud Multiphase Investigation of the Circumgalactic Medium of Low-redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pervasive presence of warm gas in galaxy halos suggests that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is multiphase in its ionization structure and complex in its kinematics. Some recent state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy simulations predict an azimuthal dependence of CGM metallicities. We investigate the presence of such a trend by analyzing the distribution of gas properties in the CGM around 47 $z &lt;$ 0.7 galaxies from the Multiphase Galaxy Halos Survey determined using a cloud-by-cloud, multiphase, ionization modelling approach. We identify three distinct populations of absorbers: cool clouds ($T \sim$ 10$^{4.1}$ K) in photoionization equilibrium, warm-hot collisionally ionized clouds ($T \sim$ 10$^{4.5-5}$ K) affected by time-dependent photoionization, and hotter clouds ($T \sim$ 10$^{5.4-6}$ K) with broad OVI and Lya absorption consistent with collisional ionization. We find that fragmentation can play a role in the origin of cool clouds, that warm-hot clouds are out of equilibrium due to rapid cooling, and that hotter clouds are representative of virialized halo gas in all but the lowest mass galaxies. The metallicities of clouds do not depend on the azimuthal angle or other galaxy properties for any of these populations. At face value, this disagrees with the simplistic model of the CGM with bipolar outflows and cold-mode planar accretion. However, the number of clouds per sightline is significantly larger close to the minor and major axes. This implies that the processes of outflows and accretion are contributing to these CGM cloud populations, and our sightlines are probing gas of mixed origins at all azimuthal angles in these low redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>On the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the Galactic bar as revealed by the LAMOST-APOGEE red clump stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12814v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Milky Way is widely considered to exhibit features of a rotational bar or quadrupole bar. In either case, the feature of the resonance of the Galactic bar should be present in the properties of the chemistry and kinematics, over a large area of the disk. With a sample of over 170,000 red clump (RC) stars from LAMOST-APOGEE data, we attempt to detect the chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonances of the Galactic bar, within 4.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The measurement of the $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ $-$ $R$ with subtracted the global profiles trends, shows that the thin and thick disks values are Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.010 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.598 $R$ + 2.551) and Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ = 0.006 $\mathrm{sin}$ (1.258 $R$ $-$ 0.019), respectively. The analysis of the tilt angle of the velocity ellipsoid indicates that the thin and thick disks are accurately described as $\alpha$ = $\alpha_{0}$ arctan (Z/R), with $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.198 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.853 $R$ + 1.982) + 0.630 and $\alpha_{0}$ = 0.220 $\mathrm{sin}$ (0.884 $R$ + 2.012) + 0.679 for thin and thick disks, respectively. These periodic oscillations in Cor_$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta|Z|$ and $\alpha_{0}$ with $R$ appear in both thin and thick disks, are the most likely chemical and kinematic signatures of the resonance of the Galactic bar. The difference in the phase of the functions of the fitted periodic oscillations for the thin and thick disks may be related to the presence of a second Galactic bar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to the precise astrometric measurements of proper motions by the Gaia mission, a new tidal stellar stream has been discovered in the northern hemisphere. The distribution of star count shows that the stream is approximately $80$ degrees long and $1.70$ degrees wide. Observations of $21$ member stars, including 14 RR Lyrae stars, indicate that the stream has an eccentric and retrograde orbit with $e=0.58$. The low metallicity, high total energy, and large angular momentum suggest that it is associated with the merging event Sequoia. This discovery suggests the possibility of finding more substructures with high eccentricity orbits, even in the inner halo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MACS J0600.1-2008 (MACS0600) is an X-ray luminous, massive galaxy cluster at $z_{\mathrm{d}}=0.43$, studied previously as part of the REionization LensIng Cluster Survey (RELICS) and ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS) projects which revealed a complex, bimodal mass distribution and an intriguing high-redshift object behind it. Here, we report on the results of an extended strong-lensing (SL) analysis of this system. Using new JWST and ground-based Gemini-N and Keck data, we obtain 13 new spectroscopic redshifts of multiply imaged galaxies and identify 12 new photometric multiple-image systems and candidates, including two multiply imaged $z\sim7$ objects. Taking advantage of the larger areal coverage, our analysis reveals a new bimodal, massive SL structure adjacent to the cluster which we measure spectroscopically to lie at the same redshift and whose existence was implied by previous SL-modeling analyses. While based in part on photometric systems identified in ground-based imaging requiring further verification, our extended SL model suggests that the cluster may have the second-largest critical area and effective Einstein radius observed to date, $A_{\mathrm{crit}}\simeq2.16\,\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{E}}=49.7''\pm5.0''$ for a source at $z_{\mathrm{s}}=2$, enclosing a total mass of $M(&lt;\theta_{\mathrm{E}})=(4.7\pm0.7)\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Yet another, probably related massive cluster structure, discovered in X-rays $5'$ (1.7 Mpc) further north, suggests that MACS0600 is in fact part of an even larger filamentary structure. This discovery adds to several recent detections of massive structures around SL galaxy clusters and establishes MACS0600 as a prime target for future high-redshift surveys with JWST.</description>

Abstract: More than a century ago, Albert Einstein presented his general theory of gravitation (GR) to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. One of the predictions of the theory is that not only particles and objects with mass, but also the quanta of light, photons, are tied to the curvature of space-time, and thus to gravity. There must be a critical compactness, above which photons cannot escape. These are black holes (henceforth BH). It took fifty years after the theory was announced before possible candidate objects were identified by observational astronomy. And another fifty years have passed, until we finally have in hand detailed and credible experimental evidence that BHs of 10 to 10^10 times the mass of the Sun exist in the Universe. Three very different experimental techniques, but all based on Michelson interferometry or Fourier-inversion spatial interferometry have enabled the critical experimental breakthroughs. It has now become possible to investigate the space-time structure in the vicinity of the event horizons of BHs. We briefly summarize these interferometric techniques, and discuss the spectacular recent improvements achieved with all three techniques. Finally, we sketch where the path of exploration and inquiry may go on in the next decades.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the X-ray emission of a sample of 17 optically selected, X-ray-detected tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered between 2014 and 2021. The X-ray light curves show a diverse range of temporal behaviors, with most sources not following the expected power-law decline. The X-ray spectra are mostly extremely soft and consistent with thermal emission from the innermost region of an accretion disk, which cools as the accretion rate decreases. Three sources show formation of a hard X-ray corona, at late-times. The spectral energy distribution shape, probed by the ratio ($L_{\rm\,BB}/L_{\rm\,X}$) between the UV/optical and X-ray, shows a wide range $L_{\rm BB}/L_{\rm X}\,\in\,(0.5,\,3000)$ at early-times, and converges to disk-like values $L_{\rm\,BB}/L_{\rm\,X}\,\in\,(0.5,\,10)$ at late-times. We estimate the fraction of optically discovered TDEs with $L_{\rm\,X}\,\geq 10^{42}~\rm{erg}~\rm{s}^{-1} $ to be at least $40\%$, and show that X-ray loudness is independent of black hole mass. We argue that distinct disk formation time scales are unlikely to fully explain the diverse range of X-ray evolutions. We combine our sample with X-ray discovered ones to construct an X-ray luminosity function, best fitted by a broken power-law, with a break at $L_{\rm\,X} \approx 10^{44}~\rm{erg}~\rm{s}^{-1} $. We show that there is no dichotomy between optically and X-ray selected TDEs, instead there is a continuum of early time $L_{\rm\,BB}/L_{\rm\,X}$, at least as wide as $L_{\rm\,BB}/L_{\rm\,X}\,\in\,(0.1,\,3000)$, with optical/X-ray surveys selecting preferentially, but not exclusively, from the higher/lower end of the distribution. Our findings are consistent with unification models for the overall TDE population.</description>

      <title>A full reconstruction of two galaxy clusters intra-cluster medium with strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whilst X-rays and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations allow to study the properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, their gravitational potential may be constrained using strong gravitational lensing. Although being physically related, these two components are often described with different physical models. Here, we present a unified technique to derive the ICM properties from strong lensing for clusters in hydrostatic equilibrium. In order to derive this model, we present a new universal and self-similar polytropic temperature profile, which we fit using the X-COP sample of clusters. We subsequently derive an analytical model for the electron density, which we apply to strong lensing clusters MACS J0242.5-2132 and MACS J0949.8+1708. We confront the inferred ICM reconstructions to XMM-Newton and ACT observations. We contrast our analytical electron density reconstructions with the best canonical $\beta$-model. The ICM reconstructions obtained prove to be compatible with observations. However they appear to be very sensitive to various dark matter halo parameters constrained through strong lensing (such as the core radius), and to the halo scale radius (fixed in the lensing optimisations). With respect to the important baryonic effects, we make the sensitivity on the scale radius of the reconstruction an asset, and use the inferred potential to constrain the dark matter density profile using ICM observations. The technique here developed should allow to take a new, and more holistic path to constrain the content of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Age Determination of LAMOST Red Giant Branch stars based on the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study we estimate the stellar ages of LAMOST DR8 Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars based on the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm (GBDT). We used 2,643 RGB stars extracted from the APOKASC-2 astero-seismological catalog as training data-set. After selecting the parameterses ([$\alpha$/Fe], [C/Fe], T$_{eff}$, [N/Fe], [C/H], log g) highly correlated with age using GBDT, we apply the same GBDT method to the new catalog of more than 590,000 stars classified as RGB stars. The test data-set shows that the median relative error is around 11.6$\%$ for the method. We also compare the predicted ages of RGB stars with other studies (e.g., based on APOGEE), and find systematic differences. The final uncertainty is about 15 to 30$\%$ compared to open clusters' ages. Then we present the spatial distribution of the RGB sample having an age determination, which could recreate the expected result, and discuss systematic biases. All these diagnostics show that one can apply the GBDT method to other stellar samples to estimate atmospheric parameters and age.</description>

      <title>Multiple timestep reversible $N$-body integrators for close encounters in planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new almost time-reversible integrators for solution of planetary systems consisting of "planets" and a dominant mass ("star"). The algorithms can be considered adaptive generalizations of the Wisdom--Holman method, in which all pairs of planets can be assigned timesteps. These timesteps, along with the global timestep, can be adapted time-reversibly, often at no appreciable additional compute cost, without sacrificing any of the long-term error benefits of the Wisdom--Holman method. The method can also be considered a simpler and more flexible version of the \texttt{SYMBA} symplectic code. We perform tests on several challenging problems with close encounters and find the reversible algorithms are up to $2.6$ times faster than a code based on \texttt{SYMBA}. The codes presented here are available on Github. We also find adapting a global timestep reversibly and discretely must be done in block-synchronized manner or similar.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitationally lensed interstellar transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider interstellar light transmission facilitated by gravitational lensing. We study axially-symmetric lensing configurations where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. With the transmitter positioned in the focal region of the lens, we investigate the caustic formed by a diffraction-limited beam of light emitted by the transmitter. We evaluated the impact of the lens's point spread function (PSF) on the received beam. We estimate the power delivered to a receiver at interstellar distances, evaluate the major noise sources, and determine the detection sensitivity in both the noise- and signal-dominated regimes. Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of the received beam, a result of the PSF from the transmitting lens. We find that detection of the lensed optical signals from nearby stars may be done relying on established optical engineering technologies. Furthermore, a network of astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple narrow spectral bands will benefit the search. Our results support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to the ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>
