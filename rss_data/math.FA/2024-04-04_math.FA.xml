      <title>Invariant kernels on the space of complex covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work sets forth the analytical tools which make it possible to construct and compute invariant kernels on the space of complex covariance matrices. The main result is the $\mathrm{L}^1$--\,Godement theorem, which is used to obtain a general analytical expression that yields any invariant kernel which is, in a certain natural sense, also integrable. Using this expression, one can design and explore new families of invariant kernels, all while incurring a rather moderate computational effort. The expression comes in the form of a determinant (it is a determinantal expression), and is derived from the notion of spherical transform, which arises when the space of complex covariance matrices is considered as a Riemannian symmetric space.</description>

      <title>Weaving Riesz Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores woven frames in separable Hilbert spaces with an initial focus on the finite-dimensional case. We begin by simplifying the problem to bases, for which we obtain a unique characterization. We establish a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for vector reconstruction, which applies to Fourier matrices. Furthermore, we show that these characterizations are still valid in the infinite-dimensional case, for Riesz bases. Finally, we obtain several results for weaving Riesz bases of translations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-selfadjoint extensions of dual pairs of linear relations in Hilbert spaces. Some properties of dual pairs of linear relations are given and an Hermitian linear relation associated with a dual pair of linear relations is introduced. Necessary and sufficient conditions for quasi-selfadjoint extensions of dual pairs of linear relations are obtained. These results extends the corresponding results for dual pairs of linear operators to dual pairs of linear relations.</description>

      <title>A representation theorem for order continuous Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $X$ is a topological space and $S(X)$ is the vector lattice of all continuous functions on open dense subsets of $X$. Although, $S(X)$ is not a normed lattice, we can have unbounded norm topology ($un$-topology) on it. On the other hand, the recent result, due to Wickstead, presents a representation approach for every Archimedean vector lattice $E$ in terms of $S(X)$-spaces. In this note, we show that this representation is order continuous and when $E$ is order complete, it coincides with the known Ogasawara-Maeda representation. Moreover, we obtain a similar representation for an order continuous Banach lattice in terms of $S(X)$-spaces that is a $un$-homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Symmetry for algebras associated to Fell bundles over groups and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10814v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To every Fell bundle $\mathscr C$ over a locally compact group ${\sf G}$ one associates a Banach $^*$-algebra $L^1({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$. We prove that it is symmetric whenever ${\sf G}$ with the discrete topology is rigidly symmetric. This generalizes the known case of a global action without a twist. There is also a weighted version as well as a treatment of some classes of associated integral kernels. We also deal with the case of Fell bundles over discrete groupoids. We formulate a generalization of rigid symmetry in this case and show its equivalence with an a priori stronger concept. We also study the symmetry of transformation groupoids and some permanence properties.</description>

      <title>Tight stability bounds for entropic Brenier maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropic Brenier maps are regularized analogues of Brenier maps (optimal transport maps) which converge to Brenier maps as the regularization parameter shrinks. In this work, we prove quantitative stability bounds between entropic Brenier maps under variations of the target measure. In particular, when all measures have bounded support, we establish the optimal Lipschitz constant for the mapping from probability measures to entropic Brenier maps. This provides an exponential improvement to a result of Carlier, Chizat, and Laborde (2024). As an application, we prove near-optimal bounds for the stability of semi-discrete \emph{unregularized} Brenier maps for a family of discrete target measures.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for a Schrodinger equation with sign-changing potential and nonlinear term</title>

      <description>arXiv:1903.03012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new variational approach to finding multiple critical points for strongly indefinite problems without assuming the weak upper semicontinuity on the variational functionals. By this approach, we obtain the existence of infinitely many geometrically distinct solutions for a stationary periodic Schr\"odinger equation, in which the linear part is strongly indefinite and the nonlinear term is allowed to change sign in general ways.</description>

      <title>Second order trace formulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.08864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Koplienko \cite{Ko} found a trace formula for perturbations of self-adjoint operators by operators of Hilbert-Schmidt class $\mathcal{B}_2(\mathcal{H})$. Later, Neidhardt introduced a similar formula in the case of pair of unitaries $(U,U_0)$ via multiplicative path in \cite{NH}. In 2012, Potapov and Sukochev \cite{PoSu} obtained a trace formula like the Koplienko trace formula for pairs of contractions by answering an open question posed by Gesztesy, Pushnitski, and Simon in \cite[Open Question 11.2]{GePu}. In this article, we supply a new proof of the Koplienko trace formula in the case of pair of contractions $(T,T_0)$, where the initial operator $T_0$ is normal, via linear path by reducing the problem to a finite-dimensional one as in the proof of Krein's trace formula by Voiculescu \cite{Voi}, Sinha and Mohapatra \cite{MoSi94,MoSi96}. Consequently, we obtain the Koplienko trace formula for a class of pairs of contractions using the Sch\"{a}ffer matrix unitary dilation. Moreover, we also obtain the Koplienko trace formula for a pair of self-adjoint operators and maximal dissipative operators using the Cayley transform. At the end, we extend the Koplienko-Neidhardt trace formula for a class of pair of contractions $(T,T_0)$ via multiplicative path.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures in the family of non-Lebesgue measurable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11810v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the additive topological group $(\mathbb{R},+)$ of real numbers, we construct families of sets for which elements are not measurable in the Lebesgue sense. The constructed families have algebraic structures of being semigroups (i.e., closed under finite unions of sets), and invariant under the action of the group $\Phi(\mathbb{R})$ of all translations of $\mathbb{R}$ onto itself. Those semigroups are constructed by using Vitali selectors and Bernstein subsets on $\mathbb{R}$. In particular, we prove that the family $(\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{B})\vee \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{V}))*\mathcal{N}_0:=\{((U_1\cup U_2)\setminus N)\cup M: U_1\in \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{B}), U_2\in \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{V}), N,M\in \mathcal{N}_0\} $ is a semigroup of sets, invariant under the action of $\Phi(\mathbb{R})$ and consists of sets which are not measurable in the Lebesgue sense. Here, $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{B})$ is the collection of all finite unions of some type of Bernstein subsets of $\mathbb{R}$; $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{V})$ is the collection of all finite unions of Vitali selectors of $\mathbb{R}$; and $\mathcal{N}_0$ is the $\sigma$-ideal of all subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ having the Lebesgue measure zero.</description>

      <title>New Multilinear Littlewood--Paley $g_{\lambda}^{*}$ Function and Commutator on weighted Lebesgue Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Via the new weight function $A_{\vec p}^{\theta }(\varphi )$, the authors introduce a new class of multilinear Littlewood--Paley $g_{\lambda}^{*}$ functions and establish the boundedness on weighted Lebesgue spaces. In addition, the authors obtain the boundedness of the multilinear commutator and multilinear iterated commutator generated by the multilinear Littlewood--Paley $g_{\lambda}^{*}$ function and the new $BMO$ function on weighted Lebesgue spaces. The results in this article include the known results in \cite{XY2015,SXY2014}. When $m=1$, that is, in the case of one-linear, our conclusions are also new, further extending the results in \cite{S1961}.</description>

      <title>$\ell_1$ spreading models and the FPP for Ces\`aro mean nonexpansive maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty set in a Banach space $X$. A mapping $T\colon K\to K$ is called {\it $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive} if for any sequence $(x_i)_{i=1}^n$ and $y$ in $K$, one has $\|(1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n Tx_i -Ty\|\leq \|(1/n)\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - y\|$. As a subsclass of nonexpansive maps, the FPP for such maps is well-established in a great variety of spaces. The main result of this paper is a fixed point result relating $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansiveness, $\ell_1$ spreading models and Schauder bases with not-so-large basis constants. As a result, we deduce that every Banach space with weak Banach-Saks property has the fixed point property for $\mathfrak{cm}$-nonexpansive maps.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problems and Hardy spaces for elliptic systems with block structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For elliptic systems with block structure in the upper half-space and t-independent coefficients, we settle the study of boundary value problems by proving compatible well-posedness of Dirichlet, regularity and Neumann problems in optimal ranges of exponents. Prior to this work, only the two-dimensional situation was fully understood. In higher dimensions, partial results for existence in smaller ranges of exponents and for a subclass of such systems had been established. The presented uniqueness results are completely new. We also elucidate optimal ranges for problems with fractional regularity data. Methods use and improve, with some new results, all the machinery developed over the last two decades to study such problems: the Kato square root estimates and Riesz transforms, Hardy spaces associated to operators, off-diagonal estimates, non-tangential estimates and square functions and abstract layer potentials to replace fundamental solutions in the absence of local regularity of solutions. This self-contained monograph provides a comprehensive overview on the field and unifies many earlier results that have been obtained by a variety of methods.</description>

      <title>Weyl asymptotics for functional difference operators with power to quadratic exponential potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the program first initiated in [Geom. Funct. Anal. 26, 288-305 (2016)] and develop a modification of the technique introduced in that paper to study the spectral asymptotics, namely the Riesz means and eigenvalue counting functions, of functional difference operators $\smash{H_0 = \mathcal F^{-1} M_{\cosh(\xi)} \mathcal F}$ with potentials of the form $\smash{W(x) = \lvert{x\rvert}^pe^{\lvert{x\rvert}^\beta}}$ for either $\beta = 0$ and $p &gt; 0$ or $\beta \in (0, 2]$ and $p \geq 0$. We provide a new method for studying general potentials which includes the potentials studied in [Geom. Funct. Anal. 26, 288-305 (2016)] and [J. Math. Phys. 60, 103505 (2019)]. The proof involves dilating the variance of the gaussian defining the coherent state transform in a controlled manner preserving the expected asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectral gap estimates for higher-order operators on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide sharp spectral gap estimates for problems involving higher-order operators (including both the clamped and buckling plate problems) on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. The proofs are symmetrization-free -- thus no sharp isoperimetric inequality is needed -- based on two general, yet elementary functional inequalities. The spectral gap estimate for clamped plates solves a sharp asymptotic problem from Cheng and Yang [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 2011] concerning the behavior of higher-order eigenvalues on hyperbolic spaces, and answers a question raised in Krist\'aly [Adv. Math., 2020] on the validity of such sharp estimates in high-dimensional Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. As a byproduct of the general functional inequalities, various Rellich inequalities are established in the same geometric setting.</description>

      <title>The analysis of vertex feedback stabilisability of a star-shaped network of fluid-conveying pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an outstanding problem whether a pipe-flow system on a star-shaped network is stabilisable by a feedback control on the common vertex. In the present paper we deal with this problem. In particular, we study the equation governing the small vibrations of a stretched elastic pipe conveying fluid in a star-shaped network and examine the question of vertex feedback stabilisability of such a system via control moments. Finding an answer to the question is not straightforward, for the system operator associated with the corresponding closed-loop system is unbounded and nonselfadjoint. An approach to the study of the stabilisation problem for the closed-loop system is presented based on the spectral approach previously introduced by the authors for star graphs of stretched elastic beams. When the tension in the pipes is greater than the square of the fluid-flow velocity, we establish a positive result that in fact gives the strong property of uniform exponential stability of the closed-loop system.</description>
