      <title>Comparative analysis of neural network architectures for short-term FOREX forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present document delineates the analysis, design, implementation, and benchmarking of various neural network architectures within a short-term frequency prediction system for the foreign exchange market (FOREX). Our aim is to simulate the judgment of the human expert (technical analyst) using a system that responds promptly to changes in market conditions, thus enabling the optimization of short-term trading strategies. We designed and implemented a series of LSTM neural network architectures which are taken as input the exchange rate values and generate the short-term market trend forecasting signal and an ANN custom architecture based on technical analysis indicator simulators We performed a comparative analysis of the results and came to useful conclusions regarding the suitability of each architecture and the cost in terms of time and computational power to implement them. The ANN custom architecture produces better prediction quality with higher sensitivity using fewer resources and spending less time than LSTM architectures. The ANN custom architecture appears to be ideal for use in low-power computing systems and for use cases that need fast decisions with the least possible computational cost.</description>

      <title>Extreme ATM skew in a local volatility model with discontinuity: joint density approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns a local volatility model in which volatility takes two possible values, and the specific value depends on whether the underlying price is above or below a given threshold value. The model is known, and a number of results have been obtained for it. In particular, a power law behaviour of the implied volatility skew has been established in the case when the threshold is taken at the money. This result as well as some others have been obtained by techniques based on the Laplace transform. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to obtain similar results by another method. The proposed alternative approach is based on the natural relationship of the model with Skew Brownian motion and consists of the systematic use of the joint distribution of this stochastic process and some of its functionals.</description>
