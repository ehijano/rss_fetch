      <title>Evaluating Soccer Player Movements Using the Attacker-Defender Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the attacker-defender (AD) model proposed by Brink et al. (2023), a motion model that describes the interactions between a ball carrier (attacker) and the nearest defender during ball possession. The model is based on the equations of motion for both players, incorporating resistance, goal-oriented force, and opponent-oriented force. It generates trajectories based on physically interpretable parameters. Although the AD model reproduces real dribbling trajectories well, previous studies have explored only a limited range of parameter values and relied on relatively small datasets.
  This study aims to (1) enhance parameter optimization by solving the AD model for one player with the opponent's actual trajectory fixed, (2) validate the model's applicability to a large dataset from 306 J1-League matches, and (3) demonstrate distinct playing styles of attackers and defenders based on the full range of optimized parameters.</description>

      <title>Reddit Deplatforming and Toxicity Dynamics on Generalist Voat Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deplatforming, the permanent banning of entire communities, is a primary tool for content moderation on mainstream platforms. While prior research examines effects on banned communities or source platform health, the impact on alternative platforms that absorb displaced users remains understudied. We analyze four major Reddit ban waves (2015--2020) and their effects on generalist communities on Voat, asking how post-ban arrivals reshape community structure and through what mechanisms transformation occurs. Combining network analysis, toxicity detection, and dynamic reputation modeling, we identify two distinct regimes of migration impact: (1) Hostile Takeover (2015--2018), where post-ban arrival cohorts formed parallel social structures that bypassed existing community cores through sheer volume, and (2) Toxic Equilibrium (2018--2020), where the flattening of existing user hierarchy enabled newcomers to integrate into the now-dominant toxic community. Crucially, community transformation occurred through peripheral dynamics rather than hub capture: fewer than 5% of newcomers achieved central positions in most months, yet toxicity doubled. Migration structure also shaped outcomes: loosely organized communities dispersed into generalist spaces, while ideologically cohesive groups concentrated in dedicated enclaves. These findings suggest that receiving platforms face a narrow intervention window during the hostile takeover phase, after which toxic norms become self-sustaining.</description>

      <title>Periodical embeddings uncover hidden interdisciplinary patterns in the subject classification scheme of science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subject classification schemes are foundational to the organization, evaluation, and navigation of scientific knowledge. While expert-curated systems like Scopus provide widely used taxonomies, they often suffer from coarse granularity, subjectivity, and limited adaptability to emerging interdisciplinary fields. Data-driven alternatives based on citation networks show promise but lack rigorous, external validation against the semantic content of scientific literature. Here, we propose a novel quantitative framework that leverages classification tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of journal classification schemes. Using over 23 million paper abstracts, we demonstrate that labels derived from k-means clustering on Periodical2Vec (P2V)--a periodical embedding learned from paper-level citations--yield significantly higher classification performance than both Scopus and other data-driven baselines (e.g., citation, co-citation, and Node2Vec variants). By comparing journal partitions across classification schemes, two structural patterns emerge on the map of science: (1) the reorganization of disciplinary boundaries--splitting overly broad categories (e.g., "Medicine" into "Oncology", "Cardiology", and other specialties) while merging artificially fragmented ones (e.g., "Chemistry" and "Chemical Engineering"); and (2) the identification of coherent interdisciplinary clusters--such as "Biomedical Engineering", "Medical Ethics", and "Information Management"--that are dispersed across multiple categories but unified in citation space. These findings underscore that citation-derived periodical embeddings not only outperform traditional taxonomies in predictive validity but also offer a dynamic, fine-grained map of science that better reflects both the specialization and interdisciplinarity inherent in contemporary research.</description>

      <title>Active-Absorbing Phase Transitions in the Parallel Minority Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parallel Minority Game (PMG) is a synchronous adaptive multi-agent model that exhibits active-absorbing transitions characteristic of non-equilibrium statistical systems. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $\beta\approx1.00$, $\delta\approx0.5$, and $\nu_{\parallel}\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $\beta\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of MF-DP dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to DP. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behaviour in socio-economic and active systems.</description>

      <title>Information is localized in growing network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic network models can capture salient characteristics of empirical networks using a small set of domain-specific, interpretable mechanisms. Yet inference remains challenging because the likelihood is often intractable. We show that, for a broad class of growing network models, information about model parameters is localized in the network, i.e., the likelihood can be expressed in terms of small subgraphs. We take a Bayesian perspective to inference and develop neural density estimators (NDEs) to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters using graph neural networks (GNNs) with limited receptive size, i.e., the GNN can only "see" small subgraphs. We characterize nine growing network models in terms of their localization and demonstrate that localization predictions agree with NDEs on simulated data. Even for non-localized models, NDEs can infer high-fidelity posteriors matching model-specific inference methods at a fraction of the cost. Our findings establish information localization as a fundamental property of network growth, theoretically justifying the analysis of local subgraphs embedded in larger, unobserved networks and the use of GNNs with limited receptive field for likelihood-free inference.</description>

      <title>Forsaking your own: unveiling the delayed recognition of Garfield's work on the "delayed recognition" phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delayed recognition (DR) implies that the full scholarly potential of certain scientific papers is recognized belatedly many years after their publication. Such papers are initially barely cited (sleep), and then suddenly, sometime in the future, their citation numbers burst (are awakened). After van Raan (2004a) called them "Sleeping Beauties" the DR phenomenon has drawn considerable attention. However, long before van Raan (2004a) Garfield studied the phenomenon in a series of articles from 1970 up to year 2004. In the present study we ask the pertinent question; Has the phenomenon of DR itself suffered the delayed recognition? In search of an answer we study the citation history of the Garfield (1980a) paper in which Garfield addressed DR directly for the first time. We find that the paper hardly received the attention befitting the Garfield's stature as an information scientist. Specifically, the paper received a meager of 10 citations up to the publication year of van Raan (2004a) and was then, in 2007, feebly awakened from its deep sleep of twenty-eight years receiving 20 citations in next four years; up to 2010. Being the undisputed giant of information science that even Garfield's paper on DR can suffer DR is hardly anticipated.</description>

      <title>Physicists Are Still Joking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This volume, \textbf{Physicists Are Still Joking}, serves as a definitive almanac of scientific humor spanning sixty years. It traces the evolution of professional folklore across geopolitical divides and technological eras. \textbf{Part I} restores the classic 1966 anthology \textbf{Physicists Joke}, which originally served as a window for Soviet scientists into the best traditions of Western scientific humor; it consists primarily of articles translated from English, here meticulously restored to their original wording. \textbf{Part II} presents the 1992 sequel, \textbf{Physicists Keep Joking}, which captures the shift toward an original, introspective Russian scientific folklore born during the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. \textbf{Part III: Still Joking} explores the modern digital age, compiling contemporary science humor from physics, astronomy, biology, computer science and AI research. While the tools of science have evolved from slide rules to neural networks, the tradition of skeptical, self-referential wit remains a constant. Spanning from the "Golden Age" of vacuum tubes to the era of AI and Large Language Models, this collection documents the enduring ability of scientists to laugh at the universe and themselves.</description>

      <title>How to optimise tournament draws: The case of the FIFA World Cup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The organisers of major sports competitions use different policies with respect to constraints in the group draw. Our paper aims to rationalise these choices by analysing the trade-off between attractiveness (the number of games played by teams from the same geographic zone) and fairness (the departure of the draw mechanism from a uniform distribution). A parametric optimisation model is formulated and applied to the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup draws. A flaw of the draw procedure is identified: the pre-assignment of the host to a group unnecessarily increases the distortions. All Pareto efficient sets of draw constraints are determined via simulations. The proposed framework can be used to find the optimal draw rules and justify the non-uniformity of the draw procedure for the stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Assessing the economic benefits of space weather mitigation investment decisions: Evidence from Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space weather events pose a growing threat to modern economies, yet their macroeconomic consequences still remain underexplored. This study presents the first dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand, quantifying potential gross domestic product (GDP) losses across seven conservative disruption and mitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary focus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) on the electrical power transmission network. We support space weather mitigation investments decisions by providing a first-order approximation of their potential economic benefits, using best-in-class scientific models. In the absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to NZ\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading supply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding NZ\$3 billion. Importantly, even with conservative impact estimates we find that research-led operational strategies, such as optimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\$370 million in losses for as little as NZ\$0.5 million in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of 740 to 1. Equally, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices achieve benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1, highlighting the strong case for investment in space weather mitigation. When also acknowledging additional unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital equipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive mitigation becomes even more pertinent. Future research needs to integrate the modelling of capital and revenue losses for strategically important industrial facilities.</description>
