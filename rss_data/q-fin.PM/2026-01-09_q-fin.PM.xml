      <title>Smart Predict--then--Optimize Paradigm for Portfolio Optimization in Real Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04062</link>

Abstract: Improvements in return forecast accuracy do not always lead to proportional improvements in portfolio decision quality, especially under realistic trading frictions and constraints. This paper adopts the Smart Predict--then--Optimize (SPO) paradigm for portfolio optimization in real markets, which explicitly aligns the learning objective with downstream portfolio decision quality rather than pointwise prediction accuracy. Within this paradigm, predictive models are trained using an SPO-based surrogate loss that directly reflects the performance of the resulting investment decisions. To preserve interpretability and robustness, we employ linear predictors built on return-based and technical-indicator features and integrate them with portfolio optimization models that incorporate transaction costs, turnover control, and regularization. We evaluate the proposed approach on U.S. ETF data (2015--2025) using a rolling-window backtest with monthly rebalancing. Empirical results show that decision-focused training consistently improves risk-adjusted performance over predict--then--optimize baselines and classical optimization benchmarks, and yields strong robustness during adverse market regimes (e.g., the 2020 COVID-19). These findings highlight the practical value of the Smart Predict--then--Optimize paradigm for portfolio optimization in realistic and non-stationary financial environments.</description>

      <title>Improving Bayesian Optimization for Portfolio Management with an Adaptive Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing black-box portfolio management systems are prevalent in the financial industry due to commercial and safety constraints, though their performance can fluctuate dramatically with changing market regimes. Evaluating these non-transparent systems is computationally expensive, as fixed budgets limit the number of possible observations. Therefore, achieving stable and sample-efficient optimization for these systems has become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization framework (TPE-AS) that improves search stability and efficiency for black-box portfolio models under these limited observation budgets. Standard Bayesian optimization, which solely maximizes expected return, can yield erratic search trajectories and misalign the surrogate model with the true objective, thereby wasting the limited evaluation budget. To mitigate these issues, we propose a weighted Lagrangian estimator that leverages an adaptive schedule and importance sampling. This estimator dynamically balances exploration and exploitation by incorporating both the maximization of model performance and the minimization of the variance of model observations. It guides the search from broad, performance-seeking exploration towards stable and desirable regions as the optimization progresses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies, which establish our proposed method as the primary approach and other configurations as baselines, demonstrate its effectiveness across four backtest settings with three distinct black-box portfolio management models.</description>
