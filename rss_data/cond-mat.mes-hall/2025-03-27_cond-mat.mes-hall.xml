      <title>Two-mode Floquet quantum master approach for quantum transport through mesoscopic systems: Engineering of the fractional quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous driving by two periodic oscillations yields a practical technique for further engineering quantum systems. For quantum transport through mesoscopic systems driven by two strong periodic terms, a non-perturbative Floquet-based quantum master equation (QME) approach is developed using a set of dissipative time-dependent terms and the reduced density matrix of the system. This work extends our previous Floquet approach for transport through quantum dots (at finite temperature and arbitrary bias) driven periodically by a single frequency. In a pedagogical way, we derive explicit time-dependent dissipative terms. Our theory begins with the derivation of the two-mode Floquet Liouville-von Neumann equation. We then explain the second-order Wangsness-Bloch-Redfield QME with a slightly modified definition of the interaction picture. Subsequently, the two-mode Shirley time evolution formula is applied, allowing for the integration of reservoir dynamics. Consequently, the established formalism has a wide range of applications in open quantum systems driven by two modes in the weak coupling regime. The formalism's potential applications are demonstrated through various examples.</description>

      <title>Underwater Willis lens for broadband low-frequency focusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband underwater sound focusing in the low-frequency range is essential for various applications such as battery-free environmental monitoring and sensing. However, achieving low-frequency underwater focusing typically necessitates bulky, heavy structures that hinder practical deployment. Here, we introduce a three-dimensional underwater lens comprising cavity-based locally resonant asymmetric structures, enabling the efficient manipulation of low-frequency waterborne sound through a densely packed lattice configuration. We experimentally validated its broadband focusing performance over a range of 20-35 kHz. In addition, we observed that our lens exhibits asymmetric backscattering-a distinctive effect arising from its bianisotropic nature-which we term the Willis lens. Unlike conventional underwater lenses that rely on fully filled structures, our design employs cavity-based scatterers, achieving a lighter yet robust focusing performance. With its lightweight, efficient, and reliable design, the Willis lens provides a promising platform for underwater sensor networks and future advancements in on-demand waterborne sound focusing.</description>

      <title>Theory of two-electrons optics experiments with smooth potentials: Flying electron molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental progress in development of on-demand sources of electrons propagating along depleted quantum Hall edge channels has enabled creation and characterization of sufficiently compact single- and two-electron distributions with picosecond scale control and the possibility of measuring details of these distributions. Here, we consider the effects of the long-range Coulomb interaction between two electrons on the real time evolution of such distributions in the experimentally relevant case of smooth guiding and quantum point contact (QPC) potentials. Both Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setups are investigated. The theoretical consideration takes advantage of the separation of degrees of freedom leading to the independent motion of the center of mass and the relative motion. The most prominent effect of this separation is the prediction of molecular bound states, into which two electrons can become trapped and propagate as a pair along the center of mass trajectory while simultaneously rotating around each other. The existence of a number of such molecular bound states should naturally strongly affect the outgoing electrons' distribution in the HBT experiment leading to bunching. But also in the HOM setup where colliding electrons are initially spatially separated, we predict new effects due to the quantum tunneling of two electrons colliding at the QPC into the joint molecular bound states. The lifetime of these quasi-bound states is shown to depend on the symmetry of the orbital wave function of the two-electron state giving rise to means to distinguish spin-triplets from spin-singlets (enabling the creation of electronic Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs). As a characteristic signature of the paired states we investigate the probability for both injected electrons to stay a long time at the QPC.</description>

      <title>Spatial Control of Charge Doping in n-Type Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially controlling the Fermi level of topological insulators and keeping its electronic states stable are indispensable processes to put this material into practical use for semiconductor spintronics devices. So far, however, such a method has not been established yet. Here we show a novel method for doping hole into n-type topological insulators Bi$_2$X$_3$ (X= Se, Te) that overcomes the shortcomings of the previous reported methods. The key of this doping is to adsorb H$_2$O on Bi$_2$X$_3$ decorated with a small amount of carbon, and its trigger is the irradiation of photon with sufficient energy to excite core-electrons of the outermost layer atoms. This method allows controlling the doping amount by the irradiation time, and acts as photolithography. Such a tunable doping makes it possible to design the electronic states at the nanometer scale, and thus paves a promising avenue toward the realization of novel spintronics devices based on topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum defects of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide: A semiclassical spherical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, i.e. the bound states of an electron and a positively charged hole are the solid state analogue of the hydrogen atom. As such they exhibit a Rydberg series, which in cuprous oxide has been observed up to high principal quantum numbers by T. Kazimierczuk et al. [Nature 514, 343 (2014)]. In this energy regime the quantum mechanical properties of the system can be understood in terms of classical orbits by the application of semiclassical techniques. In fact the first theoretical explanation of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom within Bohr's atomic model was a semiclassical one using classical orbits and a quantization condition for the angular momentum. Contrary to the hydrogen atom, the degeneracy of states with the same principal quantum number $n$ is lifted in exciton spectra. This is similar to the situation in alkali atoms, where these splittings are caused by the interaction of the excited electron with the ionic core. For excitons in cuprous oxide, these splittings occur due to the influence of the complex band structure of the crystal. Using an adiabatic approach and analytically derived energy surfaces, we develop a semiclassical spherical model and determine, via semiclassical torus quantization, the quantum defects of various angular momentum states.</description>

      <title>Broken symmetry states and Quantum Hall Ferromagnetism in decoupled twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) with large twist angle is a novel 2D bilayer system with strong interlayer Coulomb interactions, whilst suppressed interlayer carrier tunneling due to momentum mismatch between the Dirac cones of individual graphene layers. This interlayer decoherence disentangles the layer degree of freedom from spin-valley space. We demonstrate the role of charge screening effects in electronically decoupled TBLG that determines the Landau level (LL) crossings and multicomponent Quantum Hall (QH) effect resulting from combinations of broken symmetry states with spin and valley flavors of constituent layers.The N = 0 LL at zero filling factor is characterized by a field-induced Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to an ordered ground state, consistent with predictions of intervalley coherent state of Kekul\'e order. Pronounced hysteresis and electron-hole asymmetry observed in the QH regime suggests pinning of low-energy topological excitations, i.e., skyrmions with spin and valley textures, at charged defects in graphene channel.</description>

      <title>Enhanced plasmonic absorption in spontaneous nanocomplexes of metal nanoparticles with surface modified HPHT nanodiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of nanodiamonds with plasmonic metal particles is being explored for synergic effects that can enhance biosensing and antibacterial treatments, energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and quantum centres. Here we systematically investigate the formation and plasmonic properties of complexes assembled in colloidal mixtures of 20 nm gold or silver nanoparticles with 50 nm HPHT nanodiamonds, the surfaces of which are oxidized or hydrogenated. This approach provides nanocomplexes of well-defined particles with different surface chemistry and electrical conductivity. Nanoscale complexes are formed in each case, as shown by scanning electron microscopy and optical absorption spectra. The stable plasmonic frequency shows that the metal nanoparticles do not become aggregated and keep a few nm gap to nanodiamonds. The concentration dependence study reveals that the plasmonic effect can be significantly increased (up to 124 %) for lower concentrations of metal nanoparticles in the mixtures, whereas their higher concentrations reduce it, regardless of the type of nanodiamond or metal nanoparticle. Based on the experimental results and electromagnetic field-based simulations of the complexes, we discuss a model involving competing charge redistribution and plasmonic interference effects.</description>

      <title>Topological states in one-dimensional $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a closed form expression for the energy spectrum of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric superlattice systems with complex potentials of periodic sets of two $\delta$-potentials in the elementary cell. In the presence of periodic gain and loss we analyzed in detail a diatomic crystal model, varying either the scatterer distances or the potential heights. It is shown that at a certain critical value of the imaginary part of the complex amplitude, topological states depending on the lattice size and the configuration of the unit cell can disappear. This may happened at the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking (exceptional) points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural superlubricity in van der Waals layered systems holds immense promise for diverse nanoscale contacts devices and energy-efficient applications. While all-direction structural superlubricity has been widely investigated, the understanding towards the more fundamental directional structural superlubricity requires further attentions. In this study, we reveal the physical origins of directional structural superlubricity, which reduces to all-direction superlubricity under certain conditions. By investigating the evolution of incomplete moir\'e tiles at crystalline interfaces, our general scaling approaches establish the mapping from geometry to tunable directional superlubricity, agreeing with large scale molecular dynamics simulations at both homogeneous or heterogeneous interfaces. Furthermore, diverse programmable frictionless motions of nanoflakes traveling inside double-surface nanoconfinement systems can be achieved. Our work delivers new insights into the design of ultra-low frictional interfaces for future nanoscale tribology and nanoconfinement transport.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Enhanced Unconventional Spin Current Anisotropy in a Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) presents a promising avenue for energy-efficient spintronics devices, surpassing the limitations of spin transfer torque. While extensively studied in heavy metals, SOT in antiferromagnetic quantum materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SOT in epitaxial FeSn, a collinear antiferromagnet with a kagome lattice. FeSn exhibits intriguing topological quantum features, including two-dimensional flat bands and Dirac-like surface states, making it an ideal platform for investigating emergent SOT properties. Using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we uncover a six-fold symmetric damping-like SOT in epitaxial-FeSn/Py heterostructures, reflecting the six-fold symmetry of the epitaxial [0001]-oriented FeSn films. Additionally, we observe a substantial unconventional field-like torque, originating from spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization. This torque exhibits a unique angular dependence-a superposition of six-fold crystalline symmetry and uniaxial symmetry associated with the antiferromagnetic spin Hall effect. Notably, the unconventional field-like torque is enhanced when the RF current flows along the Neel vector in FeSn. Our findings reveal an unconventional spin current anisotropy tunable by crystalline and magnetic symmetry, offering a novel approach for controlling SOT in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>An electrically controlled single molecule spin switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of spin states and spin-spin interactions in atomic-scale magnetic structures is crucial for spin-based quantum technologies. A promising architecture is molecular spin systems, which offer chemical tunability and scalability for larger structures. An essential component, in addition to the qubits themselves, is switchable qubit-qubit interactions that can be individually addressed. In this study, we present an electrically controlled single-molecule spin switch based on a bistable complex adsorbed on an insulating magnesium oxide film. The complex, which consists of an Fe adatom coupled to an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule, can be reversibly switched between two stable states using voltage pulses locally via the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). Inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy (IETS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a distinct change between a paramagnetic and a non-magnetic spin configuration. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of this molecular spin switch by using it to modify the electron spin resonance (ESR) frequency of a nearby target FePc spin within a spin-spin coupled structure. Thus, we showcase how individual molecular machines can be utilized to create scalable and tunable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Edelstein Effect in Isotropic and Anisotropic Rashba Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-to-charge conversion via the Edelstein effect in a 2D Rashba electron gas using the semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We analyze the magnetization arising from the direct Edelstein effect, taking into account an anisotropic Rashba model. We study how this effect depends on the effective masses and Rashba spin--orbit coupling parameters, extracting analytical expressions for the high electronic density regime. {Indeed, it is possible to manipulate the anisotropy introduced into the system through these parameters to achieve a boost in the Edelstein response compared to the isotropic Rashba model.} We also discuss the theoretical framework to study the inverse Edelstein effect and calculate self-consistently the electric current induced by the proximity of the system to a ferromagnet. These results provide insights into the role of Rashba spin--orbit coupling and anisotropic effects in spin--charge conversion phenomena.</description>

      <title>Prospect for measuring work statistics in quantum coherent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic thermodynamcis a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities, but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems. Here we discuss the prospect for measuring work statistics in electronic devices, via a study of a transmon-microcavity system. The microwave cavity acts as a work agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics. Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference. Our work opens a way for measuring work statistics in nontrivial quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-XY quantum criticality in moir\'e Dirac materials</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional van-der-Waals materials offer a highly tunable platform for engineering electronic band structures and interactions. By employing techniques such as twisting, gating, or applying pressure, these systems enable precise control over the electronic excitation spectrum. In moir\'e bilayer graphene, the tunability facilitates the transition from a symmetric Dirac semimetal phase through a quantum critical point into an interaction-induced long-range ordered phase with a finite band gap. At charge neutrality, the ordered state proposed to emerge from twist-angle tuning is the Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator. In this case, the transition falls into the quantum universality class of the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY model in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we refine estimates for the critical exponents characterizing this universality class using an expansion around the lower critical space-time dimension of two. We compute the order-parameter anomalous dimension $\eta_\varphi$ and the correlation-length exponent $\nu$ at one-loop order, and the fermion anomalous dimension $\eta_\psi$ at two-loop order. Combining these results with previous findings from the expansion around the upper critical dimension, we obtain improved estimates for the universal exponents in $2+1$ dimensions via Pad\'e interpolation. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ four-component Dirac fermions, relevant to moir\'e bilayer graphene, we estimate $1/\nu=0.916(5)$, $\eta_\varphi=0.926(13)$, and $\eta_\psi=0.0404(13)$. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 2$, potentially relevant to recent tetralayer WSe$_2$ experiments, the Gross-Neveu-XY fixed point may be unstable due to a fixed-point collision at $N_\mathrm{f,c}$, with $N_\mathrm{f,c} = 1 + \sqrt{2} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ in the expansion around the lower critical dimension.</description>

      <title>The importance of Berry phase in solar acoustic modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytic expression for the frequencies of standing waves in stars, applicable to any radial order n, is derived from ray-tracing equations by the mean of Wigner-Weyl calculus. A correction to previous formulas currently employed in asteroseismology is identified as the Berry phase, which accounts for the vectorial nature of wave propagation in stars. Accounting for this quantity significantly improves upon previous laws for low n modes of the Sun, and we show that the Berry phase is indeed present in the available observational data of solar modes. This phase is due to inhomogeneities of the medium.</description>

      <title>The BPHZL renormalization of a planar quantum electrodynamics up to 2-loops and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.</description>

      <title>The Many-Body Ground State Manifold of Flat Band Interacting Hamiltonian for Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At a magic relative twist angle, magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has an octet of flat bands that can host strong correlation physics when partially filled. A key theoretical discovery in MATBG is the existence of ferromagnetic Slater determinants as exact ground states of the corresponding flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. The FBI Hamiltonian describes the behavior of electrons that interact with each other in a high-dimensional space, and is constructed from the band structure of the non-interacting Bistritzer--MacDonald model at the chiral limit. A key property of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG is that it is frustration free and can be written as a sum of non-commuting terms. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the ground state manifold of the FBI Hamiltonian, proving that it is precisely the linear span of such ferromagnetic Slater determinants.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal spin-charge interconversion in topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of spin-charge interconversion is critical in modern spintronics. Nonetheless, experiments conducted on a wide variety of magnetic heterostructures consistently report that charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies can be vastly different, especially in the case of topological insulators (TI). This discrepancy between the two "reciprocal" effects remains unexplained, hampering the development of spin devices based on spin-charge conversion. In this study, we investigate both spin-charge and charge-spin interconversion processes in TI Bi2Te3/Py and Pt/Py bilayers experimentally using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and spin pumping techniques. We find that the measured charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (C-S) in TI/Py is ~26 times larger than the measured spin-to-charge conversion efficiency (S-C), whereas C-S and S-C are comparable in the case of Pt/Py. Using a theoretical model enforcing Onsager reciprocity, we show that spin-to-charge and charge-to-spin conversions in bilayers are genuinely inequivalent, and explain our results as arising from the distinct spin current leakage that takes place during the interconversion. This work clarifies previous conflicting reports on spin-charge interconversion processes and highlights the potential of interface engineering to achieve efficient spin transport in TI-based ferromagnetic heterostructures, paving the way for highly efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of subsystem particle number fluctuations in a long-range system with power-law decaying hopping strength characterized by exponent $\mu$ and subjected to a local dephasing at every site. We introduce an efficient {\it bond length} representation for the four-point correlator, enabling the large-scale simulation of the dynamics of particle number fluctuations from translationally invariant initial states. Our results show that the particle number fluctuation dynamics exhibit one-parameter Family-Vicsek scaling, with superdiffusive scaling exponents for $\mu &lt; 1.5$ and diffusive scaling exponents for $\mu \geq 1.5$. Finally, exploiting the bond-length representation, we provide an exact analytical expression for the particle number fluctuations and their scaling exponents in the short-range limit ($\mu \to \infty)$.</description>

      <title>2D semiconductors as on-chip light sources for integrated nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating on-chip light sources directly into nanophotonic waveguides generally requires introducing a different material to the chip than that used for guiding the light, a crucial step that requires dealing with several technical challenges, e.g., atomic lattice mismatch in epitaxial growth between substrate and luminescent materials resulting in strain defects that lower performance. Here we demonstrate that van der Waals materials, such as the 2D semiconductor MoSe2, can easily be transferred onto gold plasmonic nanowaveguides using standard dry visco-elastic polymer transfer techniques. We further show that the photoluminescence from MoSe2 can be injected directly into these on-chip waveguides. Our fabrication methods are compatible with large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques, highlighting a potential cost-effective and scalable hybrid plasmonic and 2D semiconductor platform for integrated nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performances of many-body quantum batteries strongly depend on the Hamiltonian of the battery, the initial state, and the charging protocol. In this article we derive an analytical expression for the energy stored via a double sudden quantum quench in a large class of quantum systems whose Hamiltonians can be reduced to 2x2 free fermion problems, whose initial state is thermal. Our results apply to conventional two-band electronic systems across all dimensions and quantum spin chains that can be solved through the Jordan-Wigner transformation. In particular, we apply our analytical relation to the quantum Ising chain, to the quantum XY chain, to the cluster Ising and to the long range SSH models. We obtain several results: (i) The strong dependence of the stored energy on the quantum phase diagram of the charging Hamiltonian persists even when the charging starts from a thermal state. Interestingly, in the thermodynamic limit, such a strong dependence manifests itself as non-analyticities of the stored energy corresponding to the quantum phase transition points of the charging Hamiltonian. (ii) The dependence of the stored energy on the parameters of the Hamiltonian can, in the Ising chain case, be drastically reduced by increasing temperature; (iii) Charging the Ising or the XY chain prepared in the ground state of their classical points leads to an amount of stored energy that, within a large parameter range, does not depend on the charging parameters; (iv) The cluster Ising model and the long range SSH model, despite showing quantum phase transitions (QPTs) between states with orders dominated by different interaction ranges, do not exhibit super-extensive, i.e. more than linear in the number of sites, scaling of the charging power.</description>

      <title>Are there type-III multiferroics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroics are known to be classified into two types. However, type-I lacks sufficient magnetoelectric coupling and type-II lacks sufficient electric polarization, making both practically difficult. In this work, we explore the possibility of type-III multiferroics, where the origins of ferroelectricity and magnetism are highly intertwined but not causally related, with a combination of strong magnetoelectric coupling and large polarization. Our first-principles calculations predict that monolayer TiCdO$_{4}$ is such a type-III ferroelectric-ferromagnetic multiferroics with both electronic and magnetic orders originating from competing electron populations on oxygen atoms. It shows an electric polarization of 50 $\mu$C/m$^{2}$ while the maximum linear and quadratic magnetoelectric response are as high as 35000 ps/m and 1.59 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ s/A, respectively. Our study opens up new perspectives for the discovery and design of much-anticipated multiferroics that can be used for cross-modulation.</description>

      <title>Length-flexible strategies for efficient SERS performance in gold-nanorod-gapped nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas has shown great potential in various applications. This reflects in their large values of the customary figure of merit of SERS: the enhancement factor (EF), which is essentially the fourth power of the electric field integrated at the gap, the location at which target molecules are to be sensed. However, fabrication errors in the nanorod lengths can lead to significant variations in the enhancement factor, resulting in performance limitations whenever low values of EF are encountered. Here, we report both design and procedural strategies to address this issue. First, we show that by reducing the nanorod diameter from 360 nm to 260 nm, the EF minima can be avoided for any nanorod length, mitigating the impact of fabrication errors. In addition, we explore the influence of incident wave polarization and orientation on the EF. Our simulations reveal that by tilting the excitation away from normal incidence, it is possible to substantially enhance EF under conditions that would otherwise exhibit low enhancement. In particular, this includes the case of 360 nm diameter. These findings expand the fabrication tolerance and broaden the range of usability of gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas, enabling more robust and reliable SERS performance. Importantly, we also show that these strategies also apply to nanoantennas with covered nanorod ends, which are of particular interest for realizing hybrid devices that combine SERS with electrical transport measurements.</description>

      <title>The Fermi surface of RuO2 measured by quantum oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ had emerged as a promising altermagnet candidate, owing to reports of this material hosting antiferromagnetic ordering accompanied by a spin-split electronic band structure characteristic of time-reversal symmetry-breaking. However, recent studies have robustly questioned this orthodoxy. In particular, surface-sensitive probes have detected unusual surface states that may exhibit several characteristics expected for an altermagnet, challenging the determination of the intrinsic magnetic and electronic properties of the bulk. Here we map the Fermi surface of pristine single-crystalline RuO$_2$. By measuring magnetic quantum oscillations of a bulk thermodynamic property, our study resolves the electronic structure present in the bulk of RuO$_2$. Several Fermi sheets are discerned, with heavy effective quasiparticle masses up to five times that of the bare electron mass, indicative of strong electronic correlations. We compare our measurements with the predictions for altermagnetic and nonmagnetic Fermi surfaces deduced from density functional theory calculations. The quantum oscillatory frequency spectra correspond very poorly to the profile expected for the case of altermagnetism; by contrast, they correspond well to the nonmagnetic scenario. Our findings place strong constraints on the bulk magnetic properties of RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Controlling magnetic damping with spintronic thermal effects in Py/Fe3O4-PANI bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experiments that control magnetic damping in Py/Fe3O4-PANI via two spintronic thermal effects: spin Seebeck and anomalous Nernst. Magnetic damping is measured using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) techniques, where the sample is excited by microwave radiation and the resulting DC voltage is detected in the Fe3O4-PANI film. When a temperature gradient is applied in the longitudinal configuration, the DC voltage linewidth increases or decreases depending on the direction of the thermal gradient. This finding demonstrates that magnetic damping in Py/Fe3O4-PANI can be controlled by currents induced by thermal effects. Remarkably, the absolute linewidth changes observed in Py/Fe3O4-PANI exceed those seen in bilayers of ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet and heavy metal by more than an order of magnitude. We interpret the significant change in magnetic damping as a result of intrinsic phenomena occurring in bilayers.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of quantum many-body systems, consisting of numerous itinerant electrons that interact with localized spins or electrons, is a long-standing issue. The Kondo cloud, a quantum many-body object of conduction electrons that screens a single localized spin, is the building block of such strongly correlated electronic systems. While quantitative analysis of the Kondo cloud associated with a single magnetic impurity is well established for uniform conduction electrons, the fundamental properties of a deformed Kondo cloud influenced by conduction electrons with a modulated density of states remain unsolved. Here we report engineering of the Kondo cloud deformation by confining a part of the cloud into a quantum box called the Kondo box that mimics realistic material systems. We demonstrate quantitative control of the Kondo cloud by developing a way of tuning quantum interference in the box and monitoring the Kondo entanglement. The temperature dependence of the entanglement reveals counterintuitively that the cloud shape is altered mainly outside the box although the quantum interference in the box is tuned. Our work provides a way to simulate various strongly correlated systems by integrating the Kondo cloud, which is not possible in the current theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Exact results, transient generalized Gibbs ensembles, and analytic approximations for spacetime propagators of massive, real scalar fields in one spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The massive, real scalar field described by the Klein-Gordon equation in one spatial dimension is the most elementary example of a bosonic quantum field theory. It has been investigated for many decades either as a simple academic theory or as a realistic emergent many-body theory in low-dimensional systems. Despite this, the space and time behavior of its propagators have rarely been in the foreground, and although exact results are known, there remain gaps in the description and a lack of an in-depth physical analysis. The aim of this paper is to address the deficits by providing a comprehensive discussion of the results, and to show that this old theory still allows for several new results and insights. To start, we review the known results by providing a rederivation in full detail, to which we add a discussion on how exactly space and time variables need to be extended to complex values to ensure analyticity throughout spacetime. This procedure shows also how singularities on the lightcone need to be regularized to remain compatible with the analyticity and the physical limit of a vanishing mass. An extension to nonzero temperatures is provided by considering the contact of the field to a nonrelativistic thermal reservoir, such as is necessary for emerging field theories in condensed matter systems. Subsequently, it is shown that the transient, short spacetime propagation can be understood in the context of the modern development of a generalized Gibbs ensemble, which describes a massless theory with an effective temperature that is set by the Klein-Gordon mass and the physical temperature. Finally, an approximation scheme is presented that captures the non-trivial mass dependence of the propagators throughout all spacetime but involves only elementary functions.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum transport in double quantum dots (DQD) sandwiched between surfaces of topological insulator (TI) Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, which possess strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and $^{d}$C$_{3v}$ double group symmetry. Different from the spin-conserved case with two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) electrodes, the conductance displays a universal scaling relation for different Fermi energy associated with the topological nature/linear dispersion of topological surface states. The interplay between direct inter-dot tunneling and surface state mediated interaction leads to tunable Dicke and Fano effects with changing the inter-dot distance. We propose nano-rulers with different measurement range and resolution based on the Fano $q$-factor. Furthermore, when applying an in-plane Zeeman field, a crossover from a double-peak shape to a quad-peak shape in conductance curve appears. Moreover, the rotational symmetry of the system could also be revealed from the conductance pattern. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the quantum transport in the presence of electrode's SOC topological states.</description>

      <title>Single vanadium ion magnetic dopant in an individual CdTe/ZnTe quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the basic properties of a new physical system: an individual V2+ ion embedded into an individual quantum dot. The system is realized utilizing molecular beam epitaxy and it is observed using a low-temperature polarization-resolved magneto-photoluminescence. The nature of the system is confirmed by observation of the excitonic lines split due to the interactions of a vanadium ion with carriers confined in a CdTe/ZnTe quantum dot. Observed data are explained by the numerical modeling which includes s,p-d exchange interaction, Zeeman splitting of the exciton and the ion, diamagnetic shift, and the presence of shear strain within the quantum dot. The fundamental state of vanadium exhibits a spin +/- 1/2 making this system a textbook localized qubit.</description>

      <title>Isotopic separation in mixed clusters of molecular hydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate mixed (50/50) clusters of parahydrogen and orthodeuterium at low temperature, by means of Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results provide evidence of liquid-like behavior and partial isotopic separation in a cluster of 640 molecules, at temperature T=10 K. As the temperature is lowered below ~ 6 K, crystallization occurs, with no indication that the liquid phase is more resilient at low temperature in a mixed cluster. Isotopic separation is therefore predicted to take place at low temperature only through the slow process of molecular self-diffusion in a crystalline matrix.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and lifetime of geometric excitations in moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spin-2 geometric excitations, known as graviton modes, generally exhibit vanishing lifetimes in lattice Chern bands, including in moir\'e systems. In contrast to the Landau levels, we first numerically demonstrate that the prominent graviton peaks in spectral functions diminish rapidly with increasing system sizes. We explore how the choice of interaction affects the strength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton mode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly scattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically investigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems, continuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped excitations that mix different angular momentum or ``spins''. This is despite the surprising emergence of a ``guiding center" continuous rotational symmetry in the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the graviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic gapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that gravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning strategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum. We argue this is a necessary condition enabling the observation of graviton modes and geometric excitations in realistic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field</title>

Abstract: Quenched disorder in a solid state system can result in Anderson localization where electrons are exponentially localized and the system behaves like an insulator. In this study, we investigate the effect of a DC electric field on Anderson localization. The study highlights the case of a one-dimensional insulator chain with on-site disorder when a DC electric field is applied throughout the chain. We study spectral properties of an Anderson localized system in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium using a full lattice nonequilibrium Green's function method in the steady-state limit. Tuning the disorder and the electric field strength results in the creation of exponential Lifshitz tails near the band edge by strongly localized levels. These Lifshtiz tails create effects like insulator-to-metal transitions and contribute to non-local hopping. The electric field causes gradual delocalization of the system and Anderson localization crossing over to Wannier Stark ladders at very strong fields. Our study makes a comparison with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) highlighting some major differences and similarities in the physics of disorder.</description>

      <title>Electron transport in disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field</title>

Abstract: Transport in disordered systems often occurs via the variable range hopping (VRH) in the dilute carrier density limit, where electrons hop between randomly distributed localized levels. We study the nonequilibrium transport by a uniform DC electric field on a one-dimensional insulating tight-binding chain with the on-site disorder, using a finite-lattice calculation and the coherent potential approximation. We develop a theory of electric-field-assisted variable range hopping as a mechanism for nonlinear transport in a disordered chain. Our finite-lattice calculations of the electron propagation distance and the electron mobility determine the range of the variable range hopping as $\Delta &lt; W \lesssim 2\Delta$ in the gap $\Delta$. We further propose a nonlinear scaling of the conductivity by an electric field that is similar to Mott's variable range hopping in equilibrium. The nonlinear conductivity of an electronic lattice model follows the scaling law $\sigma(E) \propto \exp[-(E_0/E)^{\nu}]$ with the exponent $\nu = 1/3$ in one dimension for the VRH. We also discuss the experimental relevance of temperature-dependent nonlinear current-voltage relation.</description>
