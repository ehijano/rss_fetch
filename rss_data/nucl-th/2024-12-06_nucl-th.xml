      <title>Robustness of the proxy-SU(3) symmetry in atomic nuclei and the role of the next highest weight irreducible representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proxy-SU(3) symmetry predicts, in a parameter-free way, the collective deformation variables beta and gamma in even-even atomic nuclei away from closed shells based on the highest weight irreducible representations (irreps) of SU(3) in the relevant proton and neutron shells, which are the most symmetric irreps allowed by the Pauli principle and the short-range nature of the nucleon-nucleon interactions. The special cases in which the use of the next highest weight irrep of SU(3) becomes necessary are pointed out and numerical results are given for several regions of the nuclear chart, which can be used as input for irrep-mixing calculations.</description>

      <title>A simple model to investigate jet quenching and correlated errors for centrality-dependent nuclear-modification factors in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Bayesian techniques to compare a simple, empirical model for jet-quenching in heavy-ion collisions to centrality-dependent jet-$R_{AA}$ measured by ATLAS for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$~TeV. We find that the $R_{AA}$ values for central collisions are adequately described with a model for the mean $p_T$-dependent jet energy-loss using only 2-parameters. This model is extended by incorporating 2D initial geometry information from TRENTO and compared to centrality-dependent $R_{AA}$ values. We find that the results are sensitive to value of the jet-quenching formation time, $\tau_f$, and that the optimal value of $\tau_f$ varies with the assumed path-length dependence of the energy-loss. We construct a covariance error matrix for the data from the $p_T$ dependent contributions to the ATLAS systematic errors and perform Bayesian calibrations for several different assumptions for the systematic error correlations. We show that most-probable functions and $\chi^2$ values are sensitive to assumptions made when fitting to correlated errors.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations in Hybrid Stars with Slow Quark Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the radial oscillations of hybrid neutron stars, characterized by a composition of hadronic external layers and a quark matter core. Utilizing a density-dependent relativistic mean-field model that incorporates hyperons and baryons for describing hadronic matter, and a density-dependent quark model for quark matter, we analyze the ten lowest eigenfrequencies and their corresponding oscillation functions. Our focus lies on neutron stars with equations-of-state involving N, N + $\Delta$, N + H, and N + H + $\Delta$, featuring a phase transition to quark matter. Emphasizing the effects of a slow phase transition at the hadron-quark interface, we observe that the maximum mass is attained before the fundamental mode's frequency decreases for slow phase transitions. This observation implies the stability of stellar configurations with higher central densities than the maximum mass, called Slow Stable Hybrid Stars (SSHSs), even under small radial perturbations. The length of these SSHS branch depends upon the energy density jump between two phases and the stiffness of the quark EoS.</description>

      <title>Spin distribution of fission fragments involving bending and wriggling modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical description of the spin distributions of fragments from low-energy induced and spontaneous nuclear fission, expressed in an analytical form. The mechanism of pumping high spin values for deformed fission fragments is explained. The idea is that the source of the generation of high relative orbital moments and spins of the fragments are the transverse wriggling and bending vibrations of the pre-fragments, while the nucleus remains "cold" until the moment of fission. To verify this hypothesis, experimental distributions for the induced fission of $\rm ^{232}Th$ and $\rm ^{238}U$ nuclei, as well as the spontaneous fission of $\rm ^{252}Cf$, were compared. The results show reasonable agreement both in the magnitude of the mean spin values and in the sawtooth shape of the sip distribution with respect to the fragment mass number. The results are also compared with other approaches to the description of these quantities, and possible reasons for their discrepancies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Estimation of correlation coefficients and spin angular distributions of fission fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a theoretical model for studying the spin characteristics and angular correlations of fission fragments of heavy nuclei. The mechanisms of spin formation, including the influence of transverse vibrations, are considered and the relationship between the anisotropy of the angular distribution and the correlation coefficient is revealed. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data and various models developed by other research groups.</description>

      <title>Jet EEC aWAKEning: hydrodynamic response on the celestial sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of the medium response generated by the propagation of high energy partons in the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions would provide a clear and unmistakable evidence for the hydrodynamic behavior of the bulk. Recently, it has been argued that the features of the medium's back-reaction to the jet could be cleanly imprinted in the correlations of asymptotic energy flows, in principle allowing to isolate this signal from other uncorrelated physical processes. Nonetheless, the current limited theoretical understanding of these jet observables in heavy-ion collisions constrains their applicability as probes of the medium (hydro)dynamics. In this work, we provide an analytic picture for the medium back-reaction's effect on the energy flux and two point energy correlator. We show that the medium response leads to the emergence of an universal classical scaling law, competing with the perturbative QCD contribution at large angles. Comparing the associated correlator to recent experimental measurements, we find that the observed large angle features can be qualitatively described by a purely hydrodynamically driven response and its interplay with the hard jet component.</description>

      <title>Beta delayed neutron emission of $N=84$ $^{132}$Cd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the time-of-flight technique, we measured the beta-delayed neutron emission of $^{132}$Cd. From our large-scale shell model (LSSM) calculation using the N$^3$LO interaction [Z.Y. Xu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 022501 (2023)], we suggest the decay is dominated by the transformation of a neutron in the $g_{7/2}$ orbital, deep below the Fermi surface, into a proton in the $g_{9/2}$ orbital. We compare the beta-decay half-lives and neutron branching ratios of nuclei with $Z&lt;50$ and $N\geq82$ obtained with our LSSM with those of leading "global" models. Our calculations match known half-lives and neutron branching ratios well and suggest that current leading models overestimate the yet-to-be-measured half-lives. Our model, backed by the $^{132}$Cd decay data presented here, offers robust predictive power for nuclei of astrophysical interest such as $r$-process waiting points.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the influence of excitation energy and compound nucleus angular momentum on fission fragment angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the large angular momenta observed for fission fragments is still a question under discussion. To address this, we study isomeric yield ratios (IYR), \textit{i.e.} the relative population of two or more long-lived metastable states with different spins, of fission products.
  We report on IYR of 17 isotopes produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-induced fission of $^{232}$Th at the IGISOL facility of the University of Jyv{\"a}skyl{\"a}. The fissioning nuclei in this reaction are $^{233,234,235}$U*. We compare our data to IYR from thermal neutron-induced fission of $^{233}$U and $^{235}$U, and we observe statistically significant larger IYR in the $^{232}$Th($\alpha$,f) reaction, where the average compound nucleus (CN) spin is 7.5 $\hbar$, than in $^{233,235}$U(n$_{th}$,f), with average spins 2.5 and 3.5 $\hbar$, respectively.
  To assess the influence of the excitation energy, we study literature data of IYR from photon-induced fission reactions, and find that the IYR are independent of the CN excitation energy. We conclude that the different IYR must be explained by the different CN spin alone. This implies that the FF angular momentum only partly comes from the fission process itself, and is in addition influenced by the angular momentum present in the CN.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters in Neutron Star oscillations: a model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model found certain nuclear empirical parameters, in particular the nucleon effective mass, to be strongly correlated with observable properties of Neutron Stars (NSs), such as the frequencies of $f-$mode oscillations. This shows the potential to constrain the values of effective mass from future observations of $f-$modes. One of our primary goals of this work is to investigate whether such correlations are physical or an artifact of the underlying nuclear model. To test this, we perform a comparative study of the correlations between NS astrophysical observables and nuclear physics parameters using two different equation of state models based on RMF theory and non-relativistic Meta-Modelling (MM) scheme. The nuclear meta-model does not assume any underlying nuclear model and therefore allows us to test the model dependence of the results. The calculations of the $f-$mode characteristics are performed within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We use state-of-the-art nuclear microscopic calculations at low density and multi-messenger astrophysical data at high-density within a Bayesian-inspired scheme to constrain the parameter space of the nuclear models. From the posterior distribution, we probe the underlying correlations among nuclear parameters and with NS observables. We find that the correlation between the symmetry energy and its slope is physical, while that of the nucleon effective mass with NS observables is model-dependent. The study shows that the effective mass governs the high density behaviour in RMF models, while in the MM it is controlled by the higher order saturation parameters, and hence the effective mass in the MM is not correlated with NS observables. The findings of this investigation are interesting both for astrophysics as well as nuclear physics communities.</description>

      <title>Block Lanczos for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>New Skyrme parametrizations to describe finite nuclei and neutron star matter with realistic effective masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenological Skyrme energy density functional theory is one of the most popular theories for dealing with finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter, including neutron star matter. However, the density dependence of the effective masses of common Skyrme parametrizations is completely different from the one found in microscopic calculations. This can have drastic consequences. For instance, in a recent study we reported that in many Skyrme functionals, the neutron Fermi velocity exceeds the speed of light at densities that exist in neutron-star cores. To solve this problem, we try to construct new Skyrme parametrizations by including constraints from microscopic calculations of the effective mass in addition to binding energies and charge radii of finite nuclei and different microscopic equations of state of pure neutron matter. We give the parameters of the new Skyrme forces and show that our new effective interactions can successfully describe properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter (including pure neutron matter, symmetric nuclear matter, and neutron star matter).</description>

Abstract: Nuclei will play a prominent role in searches for physics beyond the Standard Model as the active material in experiments. In order to reliably interpret new physics signals, one needs an accurate model of the underlying nuclear dynamics. In this review, we discuss recent progress made with quantum Monte Carlo approaches for calculating the electroweak structure of light nuclei. We place particular emphasis on recent $\beta$-decay, muon capture, $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay, and electron scattering results.</description>

      <title>Shape transition and coexistence in Te isotopes studied with the quadrupole collective Hamiltonian based on a relativistic energy density functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolution and coexistence of shape and the related spectroscopic properties of even-even Te isotopes are investigated within the quadrupole collective model that is based on the nuclear density functional theory. By means of the constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations performed within the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov method with a choice of the energy density functional and pairing interaction, the deformation-dependent mass parameters and moments of inertia as well as collective potential of the triaxial quadrupole collective Hamiltonian are completely determined. The collective model produces for the near mid-shell nuclei, e.g., $^{116}$Te and $^{118}$Te, the low-energy $0^+_2$ state, which can be interpreted as the intruder state originating from the strongly deformed prolate minimum in the potential energy surface, along with the $0^+_1$ ground state that is attributed to the normal state based on a weakly oblate deformed global minimum. The collective model calculation suggests a parabolic behavior of the $0^+_2$ energy level near the neutron mid-shell $N=66$, as observed experimentally. Sensitivities of the calculated low-energy spectra to the pairing strength and collective mass parameters are analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress in developing high-precision relativistic chiral nucleon-nucleon interactions, we study the antinucleon-nucleon interaction in a hybrid approach where the real part of the potential is constructed in the leading-order covariant chiral effective field theory, and the imaginary part is described following the procedure adopted in the heavy baryon chiral effective field theory. The phase shifts and inelasticities with $J\leq 1$ are obtained and compared to those calculated in the next-to-leading order heavy baryon chiral effective field theory. For most partial waves, the descriptions of phase shifts and inelasticities in the hybrid approach are comparable to those in the next-to-leading order heavy baryon chiral effective field theory, confirming the relatively faster convergence of the relativistic approach observed in the nucleon-nucleon sector. In addition, we search for bound states/resonances near the $\bar{N}N$ threshold and find several structures that can be associated with those states recently observed by the BESIII Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of magnetic form factors in light nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of magnetic form factors in $A=6-10$ nuclei, based on Norfolk two- and three-nucleon interactions, and associated one- and two-body electromagnetic currents. Agreement with the available experimental data for $^6$Li, $^7$Li, $^9$Be and $^{10}$B up to values of momentum transfer $q\sim 3$ fm$^{-1}$ is achieved when two-nucleon currents are accounted for. We present a set of predictions for the magnetic form factors of $^7$Be, $^8$Li, $^9$Li, and $^9$C. In these systems, two-body currents account for $\sim40-60\%$ of the total magnetic strength. Measurements in any of these radioactive systems would provide valuable insights on the nuclear magnetic structure emerging from the underlying many-nucleon dynamics. A particularly interesting case is that of $^7$Be, as it would enable investigations of the magnetic structure of mirror nuclei.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure of $A \le 10$ nuclei using the Norfolk nuclear models with quantum Monte Carlo methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of magnetic moments, form factors, and densities of $A\le 10$ nuclei within a chiral effective field theory approach. We use the Norfolk two- and three-body chiral potentials and their consistent electromagnetic one- and two-nucleon current operators. We find that two-body contributions to the magnetic moment can be large (up to $\sim33\%$ in $A=9$ systems). We study the model dependence of these observables and place particular emphasis on investigating their sensitivity to using different cutoffs to regulate the many-nucleon operators. Calculations of elastic magnetic form factors for $A\leq 10$ nuclei show excellent agreement with the data out to momentum transfers $q\approx 3$ fm$^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $^{9}_{\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\phi\phi}$He $\phi$ mesic nuclei within the framework of the three-body cluster model as the $\phi$+$\alpha$+$\alpha$ and $\phi$+$\phi$+$\alpha$ systems, using the Faddeev formalism in configuration space. The $\phi$-$\alpha$ potential is determined through a folding procedure of the HAL QCD $\phi$-$N$ interaction in the $^4S_{3/2}$ channel with the matter distribution of $^4$He. The phenomenological $\alpha$-$\alpha$ and $\phi$-$\phi$ potentials are taken from the literature. Additionally, we construct a Wood-Saxon (WS) type interaction to simulate the $\phi$-$\alpha$ potential, also taken from the literature, based on an effective Lagrangian approach that includes $K\bar{K}$ meson loops in the $\phi$-meson self-energy. A comparison of binding energies obtained for both types of the $\phi$-$\alpha$ interactions reveals qualitative agreement. %between the obtained approaches. We predict the binding energy for the $^{9}_{\phi}$Be and $^{6}_{\phi\phi}$He $\phi$ mesic nuclei as the mirror $\phi$+$\alpha$+$\alpha$ and $\phi$+$\phi$+$\alpha$ systems in the range of 1-11 MeV and 3-10 MeV, respectively. The range of values of the binding energies relies on the choice of the WS $\phi$-$\alpha$ interaction parameters.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal form factors of $A\,\leq\,10$ nuclei in a chiral effective field theory approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the elastic electron scattering longitudinal form factors of $A\le 10$ nuclei computed in a variational Monte Carlo approach. We employ the Norfolk family of local chiral interactions and a consistent electromagnetic charge operator. Our calculations are compared both to data and past theoretical evaluations. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first exact many-body calculation of longitudinal form factors in the $7\,\leq\,A\,\leq\,10$ mass range. Finally, we identify $^9$Be and $^{10}$B as candidate targets for renewed experimental interest, as they exhibit the potential to provide more stringent constraints on the theoretical models.</description>

      <title>In-medium mass shift of two-flavored heavy mesons, $B_c$, $B^*_c$, $B_s$, $B^*_s$, $D_s$ and $D^*_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we estimate the in-medium mass shift of the two-flavored heavy mesons $B_c, B_c^*, B_s, B_s^*, D_s$ and $D_s^*$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light mesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift. This negative mass shift may be regarded as a signature of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in an empirical sense because the origin of the negative mass shift in the study is not directly related to the chiral symmetry mechanism. Our results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson ($\bar{b} c$ or $b \bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\eta_c (\bar{c} c)$ and $\eta_b (\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be in between them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in between of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in each meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding meson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.</description>

      <title>Heavy $K^*$ mesons with open charm from $KD^{(*)}D^*$ interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view of the recent discovery of $T_{cc}$, which can be described as a $DD^*$ molecular state, we perform a study of the $KDD^*$ system, and its extension to studying $KD^*D^*$, where $D^*D^*$ is bound as a spin 1 $T_{cc}$-like state, to search for the possible existence of exotic mesons with the open flavors $ccs$ being part of their quark configuration. Considering the additional attractive interactions present in the $KD$ and $KD^*$ subsystems, where the states $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ are generated, we solve the Faddeev equations considering the fixed-center approximation for the mentioned three-body systems and find the existence of two doubly charmed $K^*$-like mesons, $K_{cc}^*(4309)$ and $K_{cc}^*(4449)$, with quantum numbers $I(J^P)=1/2\,(1^-)$. Considering the respective three-body thresholds of the two systems, both $K_{cc}$-states are bound by around $60$ MeV. An experimental confirmation will bring evidence for the existence of a degree of exoticity beyond charm +2.</description>

      <title>Pi in the Sky: Neutron Stars with Exceptionally Light QCD Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion condensed neutron stars that arise in models of an exceptionally light axion that couples to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These axions solve the strong-charge-parity (CP) problem, but have a mass-squared lighter than that due to QCD by a factor of $\varepsilon&lt;1$. Inside dense matter, the axion potential is altered, and much of the matter in neutron stars resides in the axion condensed phase where the strong-CP parameter $\theta =\pi$ and CP remains a good symmetry. In these regions, masses and interactions of nuclei are modified, in turn changing the equation of state (EOS), structure and phenomenology of the neutron stars. We take first steps toward the study of the EOS of neutron star matter at $\theta =\pi$ within chiral effective field theory and use relativistic mean field theory to deduce the resulting changes to nuclear matter and the neutron star low-density EOS. We derive constraints on the exceptionally light axion parameter space based on observations of the thermal relaxation of accreting neutron stars, isolated neutron star cooling, and pulsar glitches, excluding the region up to $5 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for $ m_a \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm eV} $. We comment on potential changes to the neutron star mass-radius relationship, and discuss the possibility of novel, nuclear-density compact objects with $\theta =\pi$ that are stabilized not by gravity but by the axion potential.</description>

      <title>Regulating chiral gauge theory at $\theta=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that a proposal to nonperturbatively regulate chiral gauge theories on the boundary of a five-dimensional lattice will fail due to the existence of exact $U(1)$ symmetries not present in the target theories. A related observation is that in the presence of gauge fields with nontrivial topology, fermion zeromodes will appear embedded in the extra dimension which do not decouple from the four-dimensional world. Here we show that these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivial topological sector of the boundary gauge fields. A regulated version of the Standard Model using this approach in the continuum and large volume limits is expected to appear as if it possessed a Peccei-Quinn mechanism for relaxing $\theta_\text{QCD}$ to zero, without there being an axion in the spectrum.</description>
