      <title>Minimal projective resolution and magnitude homology of geodetic metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asao-Ivanov showed that magnitude homology is a Tor functor, hence we can compute it by giving a projective resolution of a certain module. In this article, we compute magnitude homology by constructing a minimal projective resolution. As a consequence, we determine magnitude homology of geodetic metric spaces. We show that it is a free $\mathbb Z$-module, and give a recursive algorithm for constructing all cycles. As a corollary, we show that a finite geodetic metric space is diagonal if and only if it contains no 4-cuts. Moreover, we give explicit computations for cycle graphs, Petersen graph, Hoffman-Singleton graph, and a missing Moore graph. It includes another approach to the computation for cycle graphs, which has been studied by Hepworth--Willerton and Gu.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Small Covers and Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain orientation-preserving involutions on three-dimensional small covers. We prove that the quotient space of an orientable three-dimensional small cover by such an involution belonging to the 2-torus is homeomorphic to a connected sum of copies of $S^2 \times S^1$. If this quotient space is a 3-sphere, then the corresponding small cover is a two-fold branched covering of the 3-sphere along a link. We provide a description of this link in terms of the polytope and the characteristic function.</description>

      <title>Abelian Anyons on Flux-Quantized M5-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While fractional quantum Hall systems provide the best experimental evidence yet of (abelian) anyons plausibly necessary for future fault-tolerant quantum computation, like all strongly-coupled quantum systems their physics is not deeply understood. However, generally a promising approach is to (holographically) realize such systems on branes in string/M-theory; and specifically an old argument by Hellerman &amp; Susskind gives a sketch of fractional quantum Hall states arising via discrete light cone quantization of M5/M9-brane intersections.
  Here we present a rigorous derivation of abelian anyon quantum states on M5$\perp$MO9-branes ("open M5-branes") on the discrete light cone, after globally completing the traditional local field content on the M5-worldvolume via a flux-quantization law compatible with the ambient 11d supergravity, specifically taken to be in the unstable co-Homotopy cohomology ("Hypothesis H").
  The main step in the proof uses a theorem of Okuyama to identify co-Homotopy moduli spaces with configuration spaces of strings with charged endpoints, and identifies their loop spaces with cobordism of framed links that, under topological light cone quantization, turn out to be identified with the regularized Wilson loops of abelian Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Homotopy transfer for L-infinity structures and the BV-formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit constructions for the minimal models of general and unimodular L-infinity algebra structures are given using the BV-formalism of mathematical physics and the perturbative expansions of integrals. In particular, the general formulas for the minimal model of an L-infinity algebra structure are an instance of the Homotopy Transfer Theorem and we recover the known formulas of the structure in terms of sums over rooted trees discussing their relation to Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Cornering Relative Symmetry Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry data of a $d$-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) can often be captured in terms of a higher-dimensional symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). In top down (i.e., stringy) realizations of this structure, the QFT in question is localized in a higher-dimensional bulk. In many cases of interest, however, the associated $(d+1)$-dimensional bulk is not fully gapped and one must instead consider a filtration of theories to reach a gapped bulk in $D = d+m$ dimensions. Overall, this leads us to a nested structure of relative symmetry theories which descend to coupled edge modes, with the original QFT degrees of freedom localized at a corner of this $D$-dimensional bulk system. We present a bottom up characterization of this structure and also show how it naturally arises in a number of string-based constructions of QFTs with both finite and continuous symmetries.</description>

      <title>Signed Barcodes for Multi-Parameter Persistence via Rank Decompositions and Rank-Exact Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the signed barcode, a new visual representation of the global structure of the rank invariant of a multi-parameter persistence module or, more generally, of a poset representation. Like its unsigned counterpart in one-parameter persistence, the signed barcode decomposes the rank invariant as a $\Z$-linear combination of rank invariants of indicator modules supported on segments in the poset. We develop the theory behind these decompositions, both for the usual rank invariant and for its generalizations, showing under what conditions they exist and are unique. We also show that, like its unsigned counterpart, the signed barcode reflects in part the algebraic structure of the module: specifically, it derives from the terms in the minimal rank-exact resolution of the module, i.e., its minimal projective resolution relative to the class of short exact sequences on which the rank invariant is additive. To complete the picture, we show some experimental results that illustrate the contribution of the signed barcode in the exploration of multi-parameter persistence modules.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Wasserstein distances and stable homological invariants of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distances have a ubiquitous role in persistent homology, from the direct comparison of homological representations of data to the definition and optimization of invariants. In this article we introduce a family of parametrized pseudometrics between persistence modules based on the algebraic Wasserstein distance defined by Skraba and Turner, and phrase them in the formalism of noise systems. This is achieved by comparing $p$-norms of cokernels (resp. kernels) of monomorphisms (resp. epimorphisms) between persistence modules and corresponding bar-to-bar morphisms, a novel notion that allows us to bridge between algebraic and combinatorial aspects of persistence modules. We use algebraic Wasserstein distances to define invariants, called Wasserstein stable ranks, which are 1-Lipschitz stable with respect to such pseudometrics. We prove a low-rank approximation result for persistence modules which allows us to efficiently compute Wasserstein stable ranks, and we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the interleaving distance between them. Importantly, Wasserstein stable ranks depend on interpretable parameters which can be learnt in a machine learning context. Experimental results illustrate the use of Wasserstein stable ranks on real and artificial data and highlight how such pseudometrics could be useful in data analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>On the support of Betti tables of multiparameter persistent homology modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology encodes the evolution of homological features of a multifiltered cell complex in the form of a multigraded module over a polynomial ring, called a multiparameter persistence module, and quantifies it through invariants suitable for topological data analysis.
  In this paper, we establish relations between the Betti tables, a standard invariant for multigraded modules commonly used in multiparameter persistence, and the multifiltered cell complex. In particular, we show that the grades at which cells of specific dimensions first appear in the filtration reveal all positions in which the Betti tables are possibly nonzero. This result can be used in combination with discrete Morse theory on the multifiltered cell complex originating the module to obtain a better approximation of the support of the Betti tables. In the case of bifiltrations, we refine our results by considering homological critical grades of a filtered chain complex instead of entrance grades of cells.</description>

      <title>Pointed Quandle Coloring Quivers of Linkoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enhance the pointed quandle counting invariant of linkoids through the use of quivers analogously to quandle coloring quivers. This allows us to generalize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids. Additionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree quiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers of linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.</description>

      <title>On the mod-2 cohomology of the product of the infinite lens space and the space of invariants in a generic degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb S^{\infty}/\mathbb Z_2$ be the infinite lens space and $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the binary field $\mathbb F_2.$ The cohomology $H^{*}((\mathbb S^{\infty}/\mathbb Z_2)^{\oplus s}; \mathbb F_2)$ is known to be isomorphic to the graded polynomial ring $\mathcal {P}_s:= \mathbb F_2[x_1, \ldots, x_s]$ on $s$ generators of degree 1, viewed as an unstable $\mathscr A$-module. The Kameko squaring operation $(\widetilde {Sq^0_*})_{(s; N)}: (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s)_{2N+s} \longrightarrow (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s)_{N}$ is rather useful in studying an open problem of determining the dimension of the indecomposables $(\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s)_N.$ As a continuation of our recent works, this paper deals with the kernel of the Kameko $(\widetilde {Sq^0_*})_{(s; N_d)}$ for the case where $s = 5$ and the "generic" degree $N_d$ is of the form $N_d = 5(2^{d} - 1) + 11.2^{d+1}$ for arbitrary $d &gt; 0.$ We then rectify almost all of the main results that were inaccurate in an earlier publication [Rev. Real Acad. Cienc. Exactas Fis. Nat. Ser. A-Mat. \textbf{116}:81 (2022)] by Nguyen Khac Tin. We have also constructed several advanced algorithms in \texttt{SageMath} to validate our results. These new algorithms make an important contribution to tackling the intricate task of explicitly determining both the dimension and the basis for the indecomposables $\mathbb F_2 \otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s$ at positive degrees, a problem concerning algorithmic approaches that had not previously been addressed by any author. Also, the present study encompasses an investigation of the behavior of the cohomological transfer in bidegrees $(5, 5+N_d)$, with the internal degree $N_d$ mentioned above. The interplay between the papers by Nguyen Sum \cite{SM, N.S3} and our preceding studies \cite{D.P3, D.P7-1} is also discussed.</description>
