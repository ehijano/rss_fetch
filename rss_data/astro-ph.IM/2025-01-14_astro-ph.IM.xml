      <title>LensNet: Enhancing Real-time Microlensing Event Discovery with Recurrent Neural Networks in the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional microlensing event vetting methods require highly trained human experts, and the process is both complex and time-consuming. This reliance on manual inspection often leads to inefficiencies and constrains the ability to scale for widespread exoplanet detection, ultimately hindering discovery rates. To address the limits of traditional microlensing event vetting, we have developed LensNet, a machine learning pipeline specifically designed to distinguish legitimate microlensing events from false positives caused by instrumental artifacts, such as pixel bleed trails and diffraction spikes. Our system operates in conjunction with a preliminary algorithm that detects increasing trends in flux. These flagged instances are then passed to LensNet for further classification, allowing for timely alerts and follow-up observations. Tailored for the multi-observatory setup of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and trained on a rich dataset of manually classified events, LensNet is optimized for early detection and warning of microlensing occurrences, enabling astronomers to organize follow-up observations promptly. The internal model of the pipeline employs a multi-branch Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that evaluates time-series flux data with contextual information, including sky background, the full width at half maximum of the target star, flux errors, PSF quality flags, and air mass for each observation. We demonstrate a classification accuracy above 87.5%, and anticipate further improvements as we expand our training set and continue to refine the algorithm.</description>

      <title>VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Option Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is intended to be the premier centimeter-wavelength facility for astronomy and astrophysics, building on the substantial scientific legacies of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The ngVLA would open a new window on the Universe through ultra-sensitive imaging of thermal line and continuum emission to milliarcsecond resolution, while delivering unprecedented broad-band continuum imaging and polarimetry of non-thermal emission. The ngVLA would provide a critical electromagnetic complement to a suite of particle detectors and gravitational-wave observatories, as well as space- and ground-based telescopes operating from infrared to gamma-ray wavelengths, hence enabling multi-messenger and multi-band astronomy and astrophysics. Current construction plans call for the ngVLA to leverage some of the physical infrastructure of both the VLA and the VLBA, potentially drawing on overlapping personnel and information infrastructure. Multiple options can be envisioned for a VLA+VLBA to ngVLA transition. In order to assess risks and benefits of possible transition plans, the ngVLA project established the VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Advisory Group (TAG). The primary deliverable from the TAG is a ``VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Option Concepts'' report (this report) that includes a prioritized list of transition options.</description>

      <title>Optimization of x-ray event screening using ground and in-orbit data for the Resolve instrument onboard the XRISM satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) satellite was successfully launched and put into a low-Earth orbit on September 6, 2023 (UT). The Resolve instrument onboard XRISM hosts an x-ray microcalorimeter detector, which was designed to achieve a high-resolution ($\leq$7 eV FWHM at 6 keV), high-throughput, and non-dispersive spectroscopy over a wide energy range. It also excels in a low background with a requirement of $&lt; 2 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$ (0.3--12.0 keV), which is equivalent to only one background event per spectral bin per 100 ks exposure. Event screening to discriminate x-ray events from background is a key to meeting the requirement. We present the result of the Resolve event screening using data sets recorded on the ground and in orbit based on the heritage of the preceding x-ray microcalorimeter missions, in particular, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) onboard ASTRO-H. We optimize and evaluate 19 screening items of three types based on (1) the event pulse shape, (2) relative arrival times among multiple events, and (3) good time intervals. We show that the initial screening, which is applied for science data products in the performance verification phase, reduces the background rate to $1.8 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$ meeting the requirement. We further evaluate the additional screening utilizing the correlation among some pulse shape properties of x-ray events and show that it further reduces the background rate particularly in the $&lt;$2 keV band. Over 0.3--12 keV, the background rate becomes $1.0 \times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ keV$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Determination of galaxy photometric redshifts using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable photometric redshifts determination is one of the key aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are determined. On this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). Proposed CGAN implementation, approaches photometric redshift determination as a probabilistic regression, where instead of determining a single value for the estimated redshift of the galaxy, a full probability density is computed. The methodology proposed, is tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data and compared with other existing algorithm such as a Random Forest regressor.</description>

      <title>BATSRUS GPU: Faster-than-Real-Time Magnetospheric Simulations with a Block-Adaptive Grid Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BATSRUS, our state-of-the-art extended magnetohydrodynamic code, is the most used and one of the most resource-consuming models in the Space Weather Modeling Framework. It has always been our objective to improve its efficiency and speed with emerging techniques, such as GPU acceleration. To utilize the GPU nodes on modern supercomputers, we port BATSRUS to GPUs with the OpenACC API. Porting the code to a single GPU requires rewriting and optimizing the most used functionalities of the original code into a new solver, which accounts for around 1% of the entire program in length. To port it to multiple GPUs, we implement a new message passing algorithm to support its unique block-adaptive grid feature. We conduct weak scaling tests on as many as 256 GPUs and find good performance. The program has 50-60% parallel efficiency on up to 256 GPUs, and up to 95% efficiency within a single node (4 GPUs). Running large problems on more than one node has reduced efficiency due to hardware bottlenecks. We also demonstrate our ability to run representative magnetospheric simulations on GPUs. The performance for a single A100 GPU is about the same as 270 AMD "Rome" CPU cores, and it runs 3.6 times faster than real time. The simulation can run 6.9 times faster than real time on four A100 GPUs.</description>

      <title>AAS2RTO: Automated Alert Streams to Real-Time Observations: Preparing for rapid follow-up of transient objects in the era of LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover tens of thousands of astrophysical transients per night, far outpacing available spectroscopic follow-up capabilities. Carefully prioritising candidates for follow-up observations will maximise the scientific return from small telescopes with a single-object spectrograph. We introduce AAS2RTO, an astrophysical transient candidate prioritisation tool written in Python. AAS2RTO is flexible in that any number of criteria that consider observed properties of transients can be implemented. The visibility of candidates from a given observing site is also considered. The prioritised list of candidates provided by AAS2RTO is continually updated when new transient data are made available. Therefore, it can be applied to observing campaigns with a wide variety of scientific motivations. AAS2RTO uses a greedy algorithm to prioritise candidates. Candidates are represented by a single numerical value, or `score'. Scores are computed by constructing simple numerical factors which individually consider the competing facets of a candidate which make it suitable for follow-up observation. AAS2RTO is currently configured to work primarily with photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), distributed by certified LSST community brokers. We provide an example of how AAS2RTO can be used by defining a set of criteria to prioritise observations of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) close to peak brightness, in preparation for observations with the spectrograph at the Danish-1.54m telescope. Using a sample of archival alerts from ZTF, we evaluate the criteria we have designed to estimate the number of SNe Ia that we will be able to observe with a 1.5m telescope. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our criteria when applied to mock LSST observations of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>State-space algorithm for detecting the nanohertz gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can be observed in the nanohertz band using a pulsar timing array (PTA). Here a computationally efficient state-space framework is developed for analysing SGWB data, in which the stochastic gravitational wave strain at Earth is tracked with a non-linear Kalman filter and separated simultaneously from intrinsic, achromatic pulsar spin wandering. The filter is combined with a nested sampler to estimate the parameters of the model, and to calculate a Bayes factor for selecting between models with and without a SGWB. The procedure extends previous state-space formulations of PTA data analysis applied to individually resolvable binary black hole sources. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on synthetic data from the first International PTA Mock Data Challenge. It is shown that the algorithm distinguishes a SGWB from pure noise for $A_{\rm gw} \geq 3 \times 10^{-14}$, where $A_{\rm gw}$ denotes the standard normalization factor for a power spectral density with power-law exponent $-13/3$. Additional, systematic validation tests are also performed with synthetic data generated independently by adjusting the injected parameters to cover astrophysically plausible ranges. Full posterior distributions are recovered and tested for accuracy. The state-space procedure is memory-light and evaluates the likelihood for a standard-sized PTA dataset in $\lesssim 10^{-1}$ s without optimization on a standard central processing unit.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models: New Opportunities for Access to Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptation of Large Language Models like ChatGPT for information retrieval from scientific data, software and publications is offering new opportunities to simplify access to and understanding of science for persons from all levels of expertise. They can become tools to both enhance the usability of the open science environment we are building as well as help to provide systematic insight to a long-built corpus of scientific publications. The uptake of Retrieval Augmented Generation-enhanced chat applications in the construction of the open science environment of the KM3NeT neutrino detectors serves as a focus point to explore and exemplify prospects for the wider application of Large Language Models for our science.</description>

      <title>A differentiable binary microlensing model using adaptive contour integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present microlux, which is a Jax-based code that can compute the binary microlensing light curve and its derivatives both efficiently and accurately. The key feature of microlux is the implementation of a modified version of the adaptive sampling algorithm that was originally proposed by V. Bozza to account for the finite-source effect most efficiently. The efficiency and accuracy of microlux have been verified across the relevant parameter space for binary microlensing. As a differentiable code, microlux makes it possible to apply gradient-based algorithms to the search and posterior estimation of the microlensing modeling. As an example, we use microlux to model a real microlensing event and infer the model posterior via both Fisher information matrix and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, neither of which would have been possible without the access to accurate model gradients.</description>

      <title>Unlocking ultra-deep wide-field imaging with sidereal visibility averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Producing ultra-deep high-angular-resolution images with current and next-generation radio interferometers introduces significant computational challenges. In particular, the imaging is so demanding that processing large datasets, accumulated over hundreds of hours on the same pointing, is likely infeasible in the current data reduction schemes. In this paper, we revisit a solution to this problem that was considered in the past but is not being used in modern software: sidereal visibility averaging (SVA). This technique combines individual observations taken at different sidereal days into one much smaller dataset by averaging visibilities at similar baseline coordinates. We present our method and validated it using four separate 8-hour observations of the ELAIS-N1 deep field, taken with the International LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) at 140~MHz. Additionally, we assessed the accuracy constraints imposed by Earth's orbital motion relative to the observed pointing when combining multiple datasets. We find, with four observations, data volume reductions of a factor of 1.8 and computational time improvements of a factor of 1.6 compared to standard imaging. These factors will increase when more observations are combined with SVA. For instance, with 3000~hours of LOFAR data aimed at achieving sensitivities of the order of {\mu}Jy/beam at sub-arcsecond resolutions, we estimate data volume reductions of up to a factor of 169 and a 14-fold decrease in computing time using our current algorithm. This advancement for imaging large deep interferometric datasets will benefit current generation instruments, such as LOFAR, and upcoming instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), provided the calibrated visibility data of the individual observations are retained.</description>

      <title>Scalable Cosmic AI Inference using Cloud Serverless Computing with FMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale astronomical image data processing and prediction is essential for astronomers, providing crucial insights into celestial objects, the universe's history, and its evolution. While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) Message Interface (FMI). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. CAI's significant scalability improvement on large data sizes provides an accessible and effective tool for the astronomy community. The code is accessible at https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/AI-for-Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Soft Error Rate in Space: A Unified Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new physics-based model for analytical calculation of Soft Error Rate (SER) in digital memory circuits under the influence of heavy ions in space orbits is proposed. This method is based on parameters that are uniquely determined from the results of ground tests under nor-mal ion incidence. It is shown that preliminary averaging over the total solid angle within the standard inverse cosine model allows one to take into account the effect of isotropic flow, which increases the effective SER. The model includes the ability to estimate the contribution to SER of the low LET spectrum region, which is very important for modern ICs with low Single Event Upset tolerance.</description>

      <title>Goku: A 10-Parameter Simulation Suite for Cosmological Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Goku, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations, and the corresponding 10-dimensional emulator, GokuEmu, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. The simulations span the base parameters of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and its extensions, including dynamical dark energy ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_\text{s}$). Designed within the MF-Box framework, which integrates multi-scale and multi-fidelity simulations, the suite includes high-fidelity simulations evolving $3000^3$ particles in $1\,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$ volumes and low-fidelity simulations with $750^3$ particles across varying box sizes. This approach achieves percent-level accuracy in high-likelihood regions and 5% accuracy across broader parameter ranges, while reducing computational costs by over 90% compared to single-fidelity methods.
  The simulations adopt an accurate treatment of massive neutrinos, enhancing predictions of the matter power spectrum on nonlinear scales. Key innovations include an adaptive sampling strategy and the use of beam search to optimize generalization accuracy. The emulator is valid for redshifts $z \leq 3$ and scales $0.01 \lesssim k / (h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}) \lesssim 10$. Beyond the matter power spectrum, the simulations also support analyses of other statistical measures, such as the halo mass function. The emulator and its training data are publicly available at https://github.com/astro-YYH/GokuEmu, providing a valuable resource for cosmological parameter inference and model testing.</description>

      <title>Deep radio interferometric search for decametre radio emission from the exoplanet Tau Bo\"otis b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission from exoplanets in the 10-40 MHz radio band is likely the only way to measure an exoplanet's magnetic field directly. However, no definitive detection of exoplanetary ECM emission has been made to date. A detection of the hot Jupiter Tau Bo\"otis b was reported but with an observing mode that is not immune to confusion from off-axis interference, making the detection tentative. We searched for radio emissions from Tau Bo\"otis b using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in interferometric mode, which employs direction-of-arrival information to discriminate genuine signals from interference. Our aim was to confirm the previous tentative detection or establish an upper limit in the case of a non-detection. We conducted observations using LOFAR's Low Band Antenna in interferometric mode, which totalled 64, hours spread over 8, nights. We created a custom data-processing pipeline to mitigate common challenges in decametric radio astronomy, including radio frequency interference, ionospheric distortions, and sidelobe noise from nearby bright radio sources. We used this pipeline to image the field around Tau Bo\"otis b, searching for both quiescent and bursting emission from the direction of Tau Bo\"otis b. Despite the high sensitivity of the interferometric observations and extensive data processing, no significant emission was detected from Tau Bo\"otis b in Stokes V. We establish an upper limit of 2 sigma at 24 mJy for any continuous emission from the exoplanet. The previous tentative detection of 400 mJy is thus not confirmed by the interferometric observations. The previous tentative detection is unlikely to be a bona fide astrophysical signal. Our upper limit is lower than the flux density predicted by scaling laws, meaning either the scaling laws need to be revised or the emission from this particular system is beamed away from Earth.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Detection of Instrumental Glitches in LISA TDI Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbiting LISA instrument is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz band, produced by sources including galactic binaries and extreme mass ratio inspirals, among others. The detector consists of three spacecraft, each carrying a pair of free-falling test masses. A technology-demonstration mission, LISA Pathfinder, was launched in 2015, and observed several sudden changes in test mass acceleration, referred to as "glitches." Similar glitches in the full LISA mission have the potential to contaminate the Time-Delay Interferometry outputs that are the detector's primary data product. In this paper, we describe an optimization technique using maximum likelihood estimation for detecting and removing glitches with a known waveform.</description>

      <title>Astronomy and Society: The Road Ahead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomy, of all the sciences, is possibly the one with the most public appeal across all age groups. This is also evidenced by the existence of a large number of planetaria and amateur astronomy societies, which is unique to the field. Astronomy is known as a `gateway science', with an ability to attract students who then proceed to explore their interest in other STEM fields too. Astronomy's link to society is therefore substantive and diverse. In this white paper, six key areas are analysed, namely outreach and communication, astronomy education, history and heritage, astronomy for development, diversity, and hiring practices for outreach personnel.
  The current status of each of these areas is described, followed by an analysis of what is needed for the future. A set of recommendations for institutions, funding agencies, and individuals are evolved for each specific area. This work charts out the vision for how the astronomy-society connection should take shape in the future, and attempts to provide a road-map for the various stakeholders involved.</description>

      <title>Mission Analysis for the First-Ever Saturn Trojan 2019 UO$_{14}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mid-2024, asteroid 2019 UO$_{14}$ was identified as the first-ever Saturn Trojan through ground-based archival observations and numerical simulations. Trojans, including those associated with Jupiter and other planets, raise important questions about the formation processes of our solar system. Exploring this Trojan object with spacecraft may provide direct answers and definitive evidence regarding these questions. This paper thoroughly investigates potential mission scenarios to the first Saturn Trojan, 2019 UO$_{14}$, to determine the necessary launch window and spacecraft specifications. First, by assuming a ballistic flight using chemical engines, optimal sequences of events, including (powered) gravity-assist maneuvers and deep-space maneuvers, are identified through a meta-heuristic global trajectory optimization algorithm. The analysis indicates that flyby exploration is feasible with a launch window around 2034 and a $\Delta V$ ranging from 92 m/s to 1041 m/s within an 11-year mission duration, while a rendezvous can be achieved with a departure around 2035 and a $\Delta V$ of 2-3 km/s. Specifically, the itinerary via Saturn requires a $\Delta V$ of 2 km/s and a flight time of 24.6 years, while the route via Jupiter results in a $\Delta V$ of 3 km/s and a flight time of 13.4 years. Given that the orbital motion of outer solar system objects is relatively slow, low-thrust propulsion, which gradually accelerates the spacecraft, proves to be effective. Consequently, low-thrust trajectories to 2019 UO$_{14}$ were examined. The results demonstrate that a rendezvous can be accomplished with nearly the same departure epoch, time of flight, and $\Delta V$ as in the ballistic flight, suggesting that low-thrust propulsion is highly compatible with the rendezvous scenario, as it significantly reduces the propellant mass fraction.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Australian MWA EoR pipeline II: fundamental limits of the AusEoRPipe and the impact of instrumental effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of the weak cosmological signal from high-redshift hydrogen demands careful data analysis and an understanding of the full instrument signal chain. Here we use the WODEN simulation pipeline to produce realistic data from the Murchison Widefield Array Epoch of Reionisation experiment, and test the effects of different instrumental systematics through the AusEoRPipe analysis pipeline. The simulations include a realistic full sky model, direction-independent calibration, and both random and systematic instrumental effects. Results are compared to matched real observations. We find that, (i) with a sky-based calibration and power spectrum approach we have need to subtract more than 90% of all unresolved point source flux (10mJy apparent) to recover 21-cm signal in the absence of instrumental effects; (ii) when including diffuse emission in simulations, some k-modes cannot be accessed, leading to a need for some diffuse emission removal; (iii) the single greatest cause of leakage is an incomplete sky model; (iv) other sources of errors, such as cable reflections, flagged channels and gain errors, impart comparable systematic power to one another, and less power than the incomplete skymodel.</description>

      <title>Rotation periods of asteroids from light curves of TESS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical evolution of asteroids through the secular Yarkovsky effect requires the determination of many physical properties, including the rotation period. We propose a method aimed at obtaining a robust determination of the rotation period of asteroids, while avoiding the pitfalls of aliases. We applied this approach to thousands of asteroid light curves measured by the NASA TESS mission. We developed a robust period-analysis algorithm based on a Fourier series. Our approach includes a comparison of the results from multiple orders and tests on the number of extremes to identify and reject potential aliases. We also provide the uncertainty interval for the result as well as additional periods that may be plausible. We report the rotation period for 4521 asteroids within a precision of 10%. A comparison with the literature (whenever available) reveals a very good agreement and validates the approach presented here. Our approach also highlights cases for which the determination of the period should be considered invalid. The dataset presented here confirms the apparent small number of asteroids with a rotation between 50 and 100 h and correlated with diameter. The amplitude of the light curves is found to increase toward smaller diameters, as asteroids become less and less spherical. Finally, there is a systematic difference between the broad C and S complex in the amplitude-period, revealing the statistically lower density of C-types compared to S-type asteroids. Conclusions. Our approach to the determination of asteroid rotation period is based on simple concepts, yet it is nonetheless robust. It can be applied to large corpora of time series photometry, such as those extracted from exoplanet transit surveys.</description>

Abstract: We report a spectroscopic observation of comet C/2023 A3 using an 80 mm apochromatic (apo) refractor equipped with a custom-built spectrometer with a resolution of R~2,500 on the night of 4 October 2024. Sodium D lines were detected prominently, while no other emission lines, particularly carbon-bearing species, were observed, which suggests that comet C/2023 A3 may be carbon-depleted. The mobility and flexibility of our observational setup highlight the value of amateur telescopes in observing low-altitude targets like C/2023 A3 as a complement to professional facilities.</description>

Abstract: The next generation of experiments for rare-event searches based on skipper Charge Coupled Devices (skipper-CCDs) presents new challenges for the sensor packaging and readout. Scaling the active mass and simultaneously reducing the experimental backgrounds in orders of magnitude requires a novel high-density silicon-based package that must be massively produced and tested. In this work, we present the design, fabrication, testing, and empirical signal model of a multi-channel silicon package. In addition, we outline the chosen specifications for the ongoing production of 1500 wafers that will add up to a 10 kg skipper-CCD array with 24000 readout channels.</description>

      <title>Minimum Entropy Indicator for Evaluating Dispersion Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced radio telescopes such as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) can provide high-sensitivity and high-time-resolution data of a large number of radio sources, offering an excellent opportunity for studying radio pulse profiles. However, studying pulse profiles requires the analysis of dispersion measurement (DM). The fitting method tends to make the profile conform to the model, so the fitting method is not suitable for pulse profile research. Indicators are needed to determine the profile closest to the real one, which is the profile discrimination method. This work is based on the definition of Shannon's information entropy, and believes that the pulse profile when the entropy is minimized is the closest to the true profile. This indicator is simple to calculate and can provide help for pulse profile research. This work uses real data from 48 pulsars. By calculating the information entropy of the pulsar profiles under different DMs, the DM corresponding to the minimum entropy is found, thus verifying the validity of the minimum entropy indicator. In terms of the analysis results for the 48 pulsars, the differences with the references are less than 0.5\% for all except 3 stars, and the results for these 3 stars are consistent with older references. The minimum entropy indicator can effectively obtain the DMs of radio pulse signals with low computational complexity, but it cannot be proven to be the optimal criterion. It is suggested to use multiple indicators separately when studying pulse profiles. It can be expected that the optimal indicator can provide information on the radiation mechanism of radio sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection and analysis rely heavily on efficient Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) computation, a critical parameter for identifying and characterizing astrophysical signals from detectors like LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. The gwsnr Python package addresses the computational challenges in GW research by providing a flexible, user-friendly framework for SNR calculations. It supports diverse detector noise models, waveform approximants, detector configurations, and signal parameters, making it highly adaptable to various research needs. The package introduces innovative methods, including a partial-scaling interpolation technique for spin-less binary systems, a noise-weighted inner product approach with multiprocessing capabilities, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for rapid detection probability estimation of precessing binary black hole systems. Performance is further optimized using numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, enabling significant reductions in execution time. Seamlessly integrating with other tools, such as the ler package, gwsnr is instrumental in simulating detectable compact binary mergers, estimating GW event rates, and analyzing selection effects in hierarchical Bayesian frameworks. This comprehensive toolkit empowers researchers to conduct efficient, precise, and scalable analyses of GW signals.</description>

      <title>TransientVerse: A Comprehensive Real-Time Alert and Multi-Wavelength Analysis System for Transient Astronomical Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient astrophysical events are characterized by short timescales, high energy, and multi-wavelength radiation, often accompanied by violent energy releases. These phenomena are a major focus of modern astronomical research. To reveal their underlying physical mechanisms, near-real-time, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger follow-up observations are essential. However, current transient alert systems face multiple challenges, including fragmented messages, inconsistent formats, and difficulties in retrospective analysis, all of which hinder the efficiency of triggering observations. This paper presents \textbf{TransientVerse}, an innovative real-time database platform to integrate and disseminate transient alerts. The platform uses an automated pipeline to integrate real-time alerts from multiple sources (e.g., ATel, VOEvent, and GCN). It structures unstructured text data into a dual-format database for transient alerts by using open-source large language models. TransientVerse offers retrospective searches, data visualization, literature reviews, and customized subscriptions for efficient event tracking and analysis. Additionally, for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), the platform provides real-time statistics on repeat burst rates across different time intervals and alerts astronomers about high-frequency burst sources, enabling rapid follow-up observations and optimizing the use of limited observation windows. TransientVerse improves the efficiency of acquiring transient events in real time, lowers the technical barriers for simultaneous observations, and provides robust technical support for multi-wavelength, multi-messenger time-domain astronomy and astrophysics studies.</description>

Abstract: The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory is intended to observe the atmospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets with a resolution greater than that of any previous instrument. While these observations present a substantial opportunity for astrobiology, they also incur the risk of false positives and false negatives. Here, we explore the use of systems science (in the form of network theory and thermochemical kinetics) to mitigate these risks, and briefly describe the technical specifications HWO would require in order to use these methodologies.</description>

Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Considering radio-interferometric observations, we present a fast and efficient estimator to compute the binned angular bispectrum (ABS) from gridded visibility data. The estimator makes use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques to compute the bispectrum covering all possible triangle shapes and sizes. Here, we present the formalism of the estimator and validate it using simulated visibility data for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $\nu=154.25$ MHz. We find that our estimator is able to faithfully recover the ABS of the simulated sky signal with $\approx 10\%-15 \%$ accuracy for a wide variety of triangle shapes and sizes across the range of angular multipoles $46 \le \ell \le 1320$. In future work, we plan to apply this to actual data and also generalize it to estimate the three-dimensional redshifted 21-cm bispectrum.</description>
