      <title>Dark Soliton Formation as a Dark-State Phase Transition in a Dissipative Superfluid Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify and characterize a first-order dark-state phase transition between a discrete dark soliton and a uniform superfluid in a Bose-Hubbard chain with a single lossy site. Using classical-field (truncated-Wigner) simulations together with a Bogoliubov stability analysis, we show that the dark-state nature of the soliton suppresses fluctuations and shifts the critical point relative to the comparable phenomenon of optical bistability in driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. We then demonstrate that this mechanism quantitatively captures the bistability phase boundary observed in the experiment of R. Labouvie et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 235302 (2016)], resolving substantial discrepancies in prior modeling efforts. Our results reveal how driving, dissipation and quantum coherence can interact to induce nonequilibrium phase transitions in ultra-cold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian topology in cold Rydberg quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems has unveiled new physics beyond the conventional Hermitian paradigm, yet their realization in interacting many-body platforms remains a critical challenge. Exploring this interplay is essential to understand how strong interactions and dissipation collectively shape topological phases in open quantum systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate non-Hermitian spectra topology in a dissipative Rydberg atomic gas and characterize parameters-dependent winding numbers. By increasing the interaction strength, the system evolves from Hermitian to non-Hermitian regime, accompanying emergence of trajectory loop in the complex energy plane. As the scanning time is varied, the spectra topology becomes twisted in the complex energy plane manifesting as a topology phase transition with the sign winding number changed. When preparing the system in different initial states, we can access a nontrivial fractional phase within a parameter space that globally possesses an integer winding. Furthermore, by changing the scanning direction, we observe the differentiated loops, revealing the breaking of chirality symmetry. This work establishes cold Rydberg gases as a versatile platform for exploring the rich interplay between non-Hermitian topology, strong interactions, and dissipative quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian comb effect in coupled clean and quasiperiodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study localization properties in a system of non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chain coupled to a uniform chain or clean chain by inter-chain hopping. We find that in the limit of weak inter-chain coupling, such a coupled system exhibits transitions from delocalized to intermediate phase with increase in the non-Hermiticity parameter. However, for stronger inter-chain coupling strengths, the delocalized phase undergoes a transition to localized phase and then to an intermediate phase. Interestingly, the intermediate phase in this case exhibits the non-Hermitian comb effect (NHCE), i.e., the coexistence of localized and extended states rather than being well separated from each other by any mobility edge which is conventional in any intermediate phase. We further show that such a NHCE originates from the isolated site limit of the quasiperiodic chain and provide an analytical explanation supporting the numerical signatures.</description>

      <title>Crow instability of vortex lines in dipolar superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical inviscid fluids, antiparallel vortices perturbed by Kelvin waves exhibit the Crow instability, where the mutual interaction of the Kelvin modes renders them dynamically unstable. This results in the approach and reconnection of the vortices, leading to a cascaded decay into ever-smaller vortex loops. Through mean-field simulations we study the Crow instability of quantum vortex lines in a superfluid whose atoms are subject to the anisotropic, long-ranged dipole-dipole interaction. We observe that the direction of dipole polarization plays a crucial role in determining the dynamically favored Kelvin modes. The subsequent rate of the instability is linked to the mediation of the vortex curvature by the effective dipole-dipole interaction between the vortices themselves. The vortex curvature is strongly suppressed and modes of lower wavenumber are preferred when the dipole polarization is parallel to the vortices, whereas the curvature is maximized for polarizations along the vortices' separation axis. For polarizations along the binormal axis, modes of higher wavenumber are favorable but the instability rate is considerably inhibited. This paves the way to a deeper understanding of vortex reconnections, vortex loop cascades and turbulence in dipolar superfluids.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points and beyond of far-from-equilibrium dilute system: ultra-cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics driven by the scattering from next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections in the quantum field theory has stationary solutions for the particle distribution characterized as the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points. The dynamics of the spatially homogeneous, isotropic dilute ultra-cold Fermi gas is investigated, and its kinetic equation confirms the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points in the perturbation theory by the quasi-particle assumption, in contrast to the wave turbulence of the weakly coupled ultra-cold Bose gas. In addition, other stationary states are found without the quasi-particle assumption and in a strongly coupled system. These analytical solutions provide chances for future experiments and numerical simulations in search of far-from-equilibrium stationary states of the dilute system.</description>

      <title>Beyond Entanglement: Diagnosing quantum mediator dynamics in gravitationally mediated experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</description>

      <title>Agentic Exploration of Physics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description>
