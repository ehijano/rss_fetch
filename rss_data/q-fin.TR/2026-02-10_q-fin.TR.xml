      <title>Behavioral Consistency Validation for LLM Agents: An Analysis of Trading-Style Switching through Stock-Market Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have increasingly applied Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents in financial stock market simulations to test if micro-level behaviors aggregate into macro-level phenomena. However, a crucial question arises: Do LLM agents' behaviors align with real market participants? This alignment is key to the validity of simulation results. To explore this, we select a financial stock market scenario to test behavioral consistency. Investors are typically classified as fundamental or technical traders, but most simulations fix strategies at initialization, failing to reflect real-world trading dynamics. In this work, we assess whether agents' strategy switching aligns with financial theory, providing a framework for this evaluation. We operationalize four behavioral-finance drivers-loss aversion, herding, wealth differentiation, and price misalignment-as personality traits set via prompting and stored long-term. In year-long simulations, agents process daily price-volume data, trade under a designated style, and reassess their strategy every 10 trading days. We introduce four alignment metrics and use Mann-Whitney U tests to compare agents' style-switching behavior with financial theory. Our results show that recent LLMs' switching behavior is only partially consistent with behavioral-finance theories, highlighting the need for further refinement in aligning agent behavior with financial theory.</description>

      <title>Solving Optimal Execution Problems via In-Context Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel transformer-based neural network architecture (ICON-OCnet) for solving optimal order execution problems in the presence of unknown price impact. Our architecture facilitates data-driven in-context operator learning for the incurred price impact by merging offline pre-training with online few-shot prompting inference. First, the operator learning component (ICON) learns the prevailing price impact environment from only a few executed trade and price impact trajectories (time series data) provided as context. Second, we employ ICON as a surrogate operator to train a neural network policy (OCnet) for the optimal order execution strategy for the price impact regime inferred from the in-context examples. We study the efficiency of our approach for linear propagator models with path-dependent transient price impact and explicitly known optimal execution strategies. In this model class, price impact persists and decays over time according to some propagator kernel. We illustrate that ICON is capable of accurately inferring the underlying price impact model from the data prompts, even for propagator kernels not seen in the training data. Moreover, we demonstrate that ICON-OCnet correctly retrieves the exact optimal order execution strategy for the model generating the in-context examples. Our introduced methodology is very general, offering a new approach to solving path-dependent optimal stochastic control problems sample-based with unknown state dynamics.</description>
