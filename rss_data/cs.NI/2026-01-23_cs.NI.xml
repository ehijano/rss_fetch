      <title>Resource Allocation and Sharing for UAV-Assisted Integrated TN-NTN with Multi-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with multi- connectivity (MC) capabilities efficiently and reliably transfer data between terrestrial networks (TNs) and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). However, optimally sharing and allocating spectrum and power resources to maintain MC while ensuring reliable connectivity and optimal performance remains challeng- ing in such networks. Channel variations induced by mobility in UAV networks, coupled with the varying quality of service (QoS) demands of heterogeneous devices, resource sharing, and fairness requirements in capacity distribution pose challenges to optimal resource allocation. Thus, this paper investigates resource allocation for QoS-constrained, MC-enabled, dynamic UAVs in an integrated TN-NTN environment with spectrum sharing and fairness considerations. To this end, we consider three types of links: UAV-to-radio base station (RBS), UAV-to-UAV, and UAV-to-HAP. We also assume two types of UAVs with diverse QoS requirements to reflect a practical scenario. Consequently, we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm maximizes the capacity of UAVs-RBS and UAVs-HAP links while ensuring the reliability of the UAV-UAV link. To achieve this, the algorithm maximizes the collective throughput of the UAVs by optimizing the sum capacity of all the UAV-RBS and UAV-HAP links. Next, to provide constant capacity to all links and ensure fairness, we propose another algorithm that maximizes the minimum capacity across all links. We validate the performance of both algorithms through simulation</description>

      <title>MapViT: A Two-Stage ViT-Based Framework for Real-Time Radio Quality Map Prediction in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in mobile and wireless networks are unlocking the full potential of robotic autonomy, enabling robots to take advantage of ultra-low latency, high data throughput, and ubiquitous connectivity. However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems.</description>

      <title>RF Intelligence for Health: Classification of SmartBAN Signals in overcrowded ISM band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of Radio-Frequency (RF) signals is essential for reliable wearable health-monitoring systems, providing awareness of the interference conditions in which medical protocols operate. In the overcrowded 2.4 GHz ISM band, however, identifying low-power transmissions from medical sensors is challenging due to strong co-channel interference and substantial power asymmetry with coexisting technologies. This work introduces the first open source framework for automatic recognition of SmartBAN signals in Body Area Networks (BANs). The framework combines a synthetic dataset of simulated signals with real RF acquisitions obtained through Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), enabling both controlled and realistic evaluation. Deep convolutional neural networks based on ResNet encoders and U-Net decoders with attention mechanisms are trained and assessed across diverse propagation conditions. The proposed approach achieves over 90% accuracy on synthetic datasets and demonstrates consistent performance on real over-the-air spectrograms. By enabling reliable SmartBAN signal recognition in dense spectral environments, this framework supports interferenceaware coexistence strategies and improves the dependability of wearable healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Server Allocation Under Stochastic Switchover on Time-Varying Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation to parallel queues is a cornerstone of network scheduling, yet classical solutions often fail when accounting for the overhead of switching delays to queues with superior link conditions. In particular, system performance is further degraded when switching delays are stochastic and inhomogeneous. In this domain, the myopic, Max-Weight policy struggles, as it is agnostic to switching delays. This paper introduces ACI, a non-myopic, frame-based scheduling framework that directly amortizes these switching delays. We first use a Lyapunov drift analysis to prove that backlog-driven ACI is throughput-optimal with respect to a scaled capacity region; then validate ACI's effectiveness on multi-UAV networks with an FSO backhaul. Finally, we demonstrate how adapting its core urgency metric provides the flexibility to navigate the throughput-latency trade-off.</description>

      <title>Low-altitude Multi-UAV-assisted Data Collection and Semantic Forwarding for Post-Disaster Relief</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging economic paradigm which fosters integrated development across multiple fields. As a pivotal component of the LAE, low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can restore communication by serving as aerial relays between the post-disaster areas and remote base stations (BSs). However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that LLM-AOA outperforms AOA by approximately 26.8\% and 22.9\% in transmission rate and semantic rate, respectively.</description>

      <title>Semantics-Aware Unified Terrestrial Non-Terrestrial 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks (TN-NTNs), introduced in 5G, is advancing toward a unified and seamless network of networks in Sixth-Generation (6G). This evolution markedly increases the volume of generated and exchanged data, imposing stringent technical and operational requirements along with higher cost and energy consumption. Consequently, efficient management of data generation and transmission within this unified architecture has become essential. In this article, we investigate semantics-aware information handling in unified TN-NTNs, where data communication between distant TN nodes is enabled via an NTN. We consider an Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system in which status updates from a remote Energy Harvesting (EH) device are delivered to a destination monitor through a network of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. We leverage semantic metrics, such as Query Version Age of Information, which collectively capture the timeliness, relevance, and utility of information. This approach minimizes the transmission of stale, uninformative, or unusable information, thereby reducing the volume of data that must be transmitted and processed. The result is a substantial reduction in energy consumption and data exchange within the network-achieving up to 73% lower energy-charging requirements and fewer transmission demands than the state of the art-without compromising the conveyed information.</description>

      <title>UCCL-EP: Portable Expert-Parallel Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) workloads rely on expert parallelism (EP) to achieve high GPU efficiency. State-of-the-art EP communication systems such as DeepEP demonstrate strong performance but exhibit poor portability across heterogeneous GPU and NIC platforms. The poor portability is rooted in architecture: GPU-initiated token-level RDMA communication requires tight vertical integration between GPUs and NICs, e.g., GPU writes to NIC driver/MMIO interfaces.
  We present UCCL-EP, a portable EP communication system that delivers DeepEP-level performance across heterogeneous GPU and NIC hardware. UCCL-EP replaces GPU-initiated RDMA with a high-throughput GPU-CPU control channel: compact token-routing commands are transferred to multithreaded CPU proxies, which then issue GPUDirect RDMA operations on behalf of GPUs. UCCL-EP further emulates various ordering semantics required by specialized EP communication modes using RDMA immediate data, enabling correctness on NICs that lack such ordering, e.g., AWS EFA. We implement UCCL-EP on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with EFA and Broadcom NICs. On EFA, it outperforms the best existing EP solution by up to $2.1\times$ for dispatch and combine throughput. On NVIDIA-only platform, UCCL-EP achieves comparable performance to the original DeepEP. UCCL-EP also improves token throughput on SGLang by up to 40% on the NVIDIA+EFA platform, and improves DeepSeek-V3 training throughput over the AMD Primus/Megatron-LM framework by up to 45% on a 16-node AMD+Broadcom platform.</description>
