      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning in Applied Control: Challenges, Analysis, and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in adopting deep neural networks to enhance the performance of conventional reinforcement learning. A notable milestone was the development of Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which achieved human-level performance across a range of Atari games, demonstrating the potential of deep learning to stabilise and scale reinforcement learning. Subsequently, extensions to continuous control algorithms paved the way for a new paradigm in control, one that has attracted broader attention than any classical control approach in recent literature. These developments also demonstrated strong potential for advancing data-driven, model-free algorithms for control and for achieving higher levels of autonomy. However, the application of these methods has remained largely confined to simulated and gaming environments, with ongoing efforts to extend them to real-world applications. Before such deployment can be realised, a solid and quantitative understanding of their performance on applied control problems is necessary. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of these approaches on four diverse benchmark problems with implementation results. This analysis offers a scrutinising and systematic evaluation to shed light on the real-world capabilities and limitations of deep reinforcement learning methods in applied control settings.</description>

      <title>Maneuver Detection via a Confidence Dominance Maneuver Indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient maneuver detection is critical for ensuring the safety and predictability of spacecraft trajectories. This paper presents a novel maneuver detection approach based on comparing the confidence levels associated with the orbital state estimation and the observation likelihood. First, a confidence-dominance maneuver indicator (CDMI) is proposed by setting a confidence level for the state estimation and computing the maximum likelihood of the observation and its confidence level. The CDMI then flag a maneuver when the observation's confidence level exceeds that of the state estimation, indicating that the observation is unlikely under the no-maneuver hypothesis while maintaining consistency with the prior state estimation confidence. To efficiently compute the maximum likelihood of the observation and obtain the CDMI, a recursive polynomial optimization method is developed, taking advantage of convex optimization and polynomial approximation. In addition, an integrated CDMI approach is developed to eliminate the need to manually select the state confidence level. The integrated CDMI approach maintains high detection accuracy while simultaneously providing an indication of maneuver likelihood, thereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability. The performance of the proposed CDMI-based maneuver detection approaches is evaluated against an optimal control distance metric and two mixture-based approaches. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed integrated CDMI approach can achieve up to 99.33\% detection accuracy, at least 10% higher than the competing methods, while substantially reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Neural Parameter-varying Data-enabled Predictive Control of Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets (APPJs) show significant potential for biomedical applications, but their inherent complexity, characterized by nonlinear dynamics and strong sensitivity to operating conditions like tip-to-surface distance, presents considerable challenges for achieving robust and reliable real-time control. To address these issues, this paper presents the Neural Parameter-Varying Data-enabled Predictive Control (NPV-DeePC) framework. By integrating hyper neural networks (hypernets) into the neural Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) paradigm, the proposed method adaptively captures system nonlinearities and parameter variations, updates the neural feature space accordingly, and enables efficient and accurate trajectory prediction and control. The NPV-DeePC framework is validated through extensive simulations involving surface temperature tracking and thermal dose delivery. The results highlight its ability to outperform existing controllers in terms of accuracy and adaptability. The computational efficiency of the NPV-DeePC approach makes it a viable candidate for real-time applications. These findings underscore its potential to advance the safe and precise control of APPJs and provide a scalable solution for other parameter-varying nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Level Distributed Interference Management for Large-Scale HAPS-Empowered vHetNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks (xG) must provide ubiquitous connectivity while enhancing user experience in both densely populated urban areas and rural regions. To achieve this, a disruptive network architecture is essential, and high altitude platform stations (HAPS) offer a promising solution. By integrating HAPS with terrestrial networks, we can create HAPS-empowered vertical heterogeneous networks (vHetNets), which significantly improve coverage and capacity, as well as support emerging use cases. In HAPS-empowered vHetNets, different tiers can share the same spectrum, forming harmonized spectrum vHetNets that enhance spectral efficiency (SE). However, we face two major challenges: i) co-channel interference in harmonized spectrum vHetNets, and ii) the large-scale nature of the network. To address the first challenge, we adopt a cell-free approach as the underlying network architecture for the HAPS-empowered vHetNet. In this approach, base stations use beamforming to direct high-gain, narrow beams toward users, which helps mitigate interference. However, this creates a nonconvex and high-dimensional optimization problem, which highlights the second challenge of dealing with a large-scale network. Consequently, centralized solutions become impractical due to the computational and communication overhead involved. The standard two-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is one option, but nonconvex constraints can hinder its convergence. As an alternative, we have developed a two-level distributed proportional fairness beamforming weight design (PFBWD) algorithm. This algorithm uses a combination of the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and a three-block ADMM framework. The proposed method effectively tackles nonconvexity, reduces complexity, and enables scalable, distributed optimization with guaranteed convergence.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Stability Analysis Method with Dynamic Phasors for LV AC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation of inductive coupling lines with conventional static phasors is the main reason of inadequacy of the existing phasors based simplified stability analysis methods for microgrids with inductive coupling lines. In the literature, dynamic phasors have been proposed for the dynamic modelling of inductive lines to conserve the simplified structure of the analysis method. In this study a generalized stability analysis method for LV AC microgrids, composed of droop controlled inverters, is presented. The proposed analysis method is based on the inclusion of dynamic phasors for inductive coupling lines into the existing phasors based stability analysis method. The results show that the stability analysis method with dynamic phasors successfully predicts the instability boundaries of LV AC microgrids.</description>

      <title>PGD-based optimization of 3D bobsleigh track centerlines from 2D centerlines for simulation applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centerline of a bobsleigh track defines its geometry and is essential for simulation modeling. To reduce bBobsleigh training costs, leveraging the centerline of the bobsleigh track to construct a virtual environment that closely replicates real competitive settings presents a promising solution. However, publicly available centerline data are typically limited and it is imprecise to construct a training system solely based on 2-dimensional (2D) centerline. To address this practical issue, this paper proposes a method for generating a 3-dimensional (3D) track centerline based on 2D centerline data. Incorporating international track design regulations, the method formulates an optimization problem that considers total track length, height difference, slope constraints, and geometric continuity. A Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The generated 3D centerlines are compared with real track data, and the results show that the method can reproduce realistic centerline trends from original or scaled 2D data. For the selected track segment, the relative errors in total length, height difference, and average slope are within 1.7%, 3.2% and 4.1%, respectively, for real 2D data and within 1.1%, 3.5% and 4.3% respectively for scaled data. All slope values remain within the allowable limits. Moreover, by adjusting the segmentation or modifying the weight of height difference in the cost function, various centerline styles applicable to different competitions can be generated. Under different segmentation and weight factors, the maximum errors reach up to 4.4%, 4.8%, and 9.8%, and 4.4%, 4.8%, and 10.0%, respectively. The proposed method provides a flexible and efficient tool for supporting bobsleigh track centerline design.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Processing and Validation of Grid Data for Assessing the Fair Spatial Distribution of PV Hosting Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of PV systems and increased electrification levels present significant challenges to the traditional design and operation of distribution grids. This paper presents a methodology for extracting, validating, and adapting grid data from a distribution system operator's (DSO) database to facilitate large-scale grid studies, including load flow and optimal power flow analyses. The validation process combines rule-based sanity checks and offline automated power flow analyses to ensure data consistency and detect potential errors in the grid database, allowing for their correction. As a practical application, the paper proposes a method to assess the PV hosting capacity of distribution grids, with a focus on ensuring fairness in their spatial distribution. By incorporating fairness criteria into the analyses, we quantify the costs (in terms of missed revenues from selling PV generation) associated with spatial fairness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an energy management system (EMS) for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers with colocated renewable generation. Under a profit-maximizing framework, the EMS of renewable-colocated data center (RCDC) co-optimizes AI workload scheduling, on-site renewable utilization, and electricity market participation. Within both wholesale and retail market participation models, the economic benefit of the RCDC operation is maximized. Empirical evaluations using real-world traces of electricity prices, data center power consumption, and renewable generation demonstrate significant profit gains from renewable and AI data center colocations.</description>

      <title>Understanding Driving Risks using Large Language Models: Toward Elderly Driver Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density, assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition. These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection. Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0% (multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments. Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver assessments.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-Native RAN: An Operator's Perspective of 6G Day 1 Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has become the most certain and prominent feature of 6G mobile networks. Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not natively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G shall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support ubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and standardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and standardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G, with a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and capabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its three essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization direction; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable AI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The standardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including an AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale field trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause identification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture and the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation with practical deployment.</description>

      <title>A Dissipativity Framework for Constructing Scaled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaled relative graphs have been originally introduced in the context of convex optimization and have recently gained attention in the control systems community for the graphical analysis of nonlinear systems. Of particular interest in stability analysis of feedback systems is the scaled graph, a special case of the scaled relative graph. In many ways, scaled graphs can be seen as a generalization of the classical Nyquist plot for linear time-invariant systems, and facilitate a powerful graphical tool for analyzing nonlinear feedback systems. In their current formulation, however, scaled graphs require characterizing the input-output behaviour of a system for an uncountable number of inputs. This poses a practical bottleneck in obtaining the scaled graph of a nonlinear system, and currently limits its use. This paper presents a framework grounded in dissipativity for efficiently computing the scaled graph of several important classes of systems, including multivariable linear time-invariant systems, impulsive systems, and piecewise linear systems. The proposed approach leverages novel connections between linear matrix inequalities, integral quadratic constraints, and scaled graphs, and is shown to be exact for specific linear time-invariant systems. The results are accompanied by several examples illustrating the potential and effectiveness of the presented framework.</description>

Abstract: For developing innovative systems architectures, modeling and optimization techniques have been central to frame the architecting process and define the optimization and modeling problems. In this context, for system-of-systems the use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is highly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted applications. However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated approaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges, surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization utilizing Gaussian process models have emerged.</description>

      <title>Electricity-Aware Bid Format for Coordinated Heat and Electricity Market Clearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.03120v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordination between heat and electricity markets is essential to achieve a cost-effective and efficient operation of the energy system. In the current sequential market practice, the heat market is cleared before the electricity market and has no insight into the impacts of heat dispatch on the electricity market. While preserving this sequential practice, this paper introduces an electricity-aware bid format for the coordination of heat and electricity systems. This novel market mechanism defines heat bids conditionally on the day-ahead electricity prices. Prior to clearing heat and electricity markets, the proposed bid selection mechanism selects the valid bids which minimize the heat system operating cost while anticipating heat and electricity market clearing. This mechanism is modeled as a trilevel optimization problem, which we recast as a mixed-integer linear program using a lexicographic function. We use a realistic case study based on the Danish electricity and heat system and show that the proposed bid selection mechanism yields a 4.5% reduction in the total operating cost of heat and electricity systems compared to the existing market-clearing procedure while reducing the financial losses of combined heat and power plants and heat pumps due to invalid bids by up to 20.3 million euros.</description>

      <title>Wholesale Market Participation of DERA: Competitive DER Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02004v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) by a profit-seeking aggregator participating directly in wholesale market under distribution network access constraints. We propose a competitive DER aggregator (DERA) model that maximizes the DERA's profit while ensuring each aggregated customer gains no less surplus and pays no higher energy cost than under the regulated retail tariff. The DERA participates in wholesale electricity market as virtual storage with optimized generation offers and consumption bids derived from our competitive aggregation model. Also derived are DERA's bid curves for the distribution network access and DERA's profitability when competing with the regulated retail tariff. We show that, with the same distribution network access, the proposed DERA's wholesale market participation achieves the same welfare-maximizing outcome as when its customers participate directly in the wholesale market. Numerical studies compare the proposed DERA with existing methods in terms of customer surplus and DERA profit. We empirically evaluate how many DERAs can survive in the competition at long-run equilibrium, and assess the impacts of DER adoption levels and distribution network access on short-run market outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Preventive-Corrective Scheme for Ensuring Power System Security During Active Wildfire Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is on operating the electric power grid in a secure manner when wildfire risks are high. This is a challenging problem because of the uncertain ways in which the fires can impact the operation of the power system. To address this challenge, we propose a novel preventive-corrective coordinated decision-making scheme that quickly mitigates both static and dynamic insecurities given the risk of active wildfires in a region. The scheme utilizes a comprehensive contingency analysis tool for multi-asset outages that leverages: (i) a Feasibility Test algorithm which exhaustively desaturates overloaded cut-sets to prevent cascading line outages, and (ii) a data-driven transient stability analyzer which alleviates dynamic instabilities. This tool is then used to operate a coordinated unit commitment/optimal power flow model that is designed to adapt to varying risk levels associated with wildfires. Depending on the allowed risk, the model balances economical operation and grid robustness. The results obtained using the IEEE 118-bus system indicate that the proposed approach alleviates system vulnerabilities to wildfires while also minimizing operational cost.</description>

      <title>Online convex optimization for constrained control of nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a modular approach that combines the online convex optimization framework and reference governors to solve a constrained control problem featuring time-varying and a priori unknown cost functions. Compared to existing results, the proposed framework is uniquely applicable to nonlinear dynamical systems subject to state and input constraints. Furthermore, our method is general in the sense that we do not limit our analysis to a specific choice of online convex optimization algorithm or reference governor. We show that the dynamic regret of the proposed framework is bounded linearly in both the dynamic regret and the path length of the chosen online convex optimization algorithm, even though the online convex optimization algorithm does not account for the underlying dynamics. We prove that a linear bound with respect to the online convex optimization algorithm's dynamic regret is optimal, i.e., cannot be improved upon. Furthermore, for a standard class of online convex optimization algorithms, our proposed framework attains a bound on its dynamic regret that is linear only in the variation of the cost functions, which is known to be an optimal bound. Finally, we demonstrate implementation and flexibility of the proposed framework by comparing different combinations of online convex optimization algorithms and reference governors to control a nonlinear chemical reactor in a numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of CNNs and MLPs for Radiation Heat Transfer in 2-D Furnaces with Spectrally Participative Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy. Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures. Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper understanding of the model behavior.</description>

      <title>Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization for Online Navigation during Robotic Physiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic devices provide a great opportunity to assist in delivering physical therapy and rehabilitation movements, yet current robot-assisted methods struggle to incorporate biomechanical metrics essential for safe and effective therapy. We introduce BATON, a Biomechanics-Aware Trajectory Optimization approach to online robotic Navigation of human musculoskeletal loads for rotator cuff rehabilitation. BATON embeds a high-fidelity OpenSim model of the human shoulder into an optimal control framework, generating strain-minimizing trajectories for real-time control of therapeutic movements. \addedText{Its core strength lies in the ability to adapt biomechanics-informed trajectories online to unpredictable volitional human actions or reflexive reactions during physical human-robot interaction based on robot-sensed motion and forces. BATON's adaptability is enabled by a real-time, model-based estimator that infers changes in muscle activity via a rapid redundancy solver driven by robot pose and force/torque sensor data. We validated BATON through physical human-robot interaction experiments, assessing response speed, motion smoothness, and interaction forces.</description>

      <title>A Stability Condition for Online Feedback Optimization without Timescale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a control approach to drive a dynamical plant to an optimal steady state. By interconnecting optimization algorithms with real-time plant measurements, OFO provides all the benefits of feedback control, yet without requiring exact knowledge of plant dynamics for computing a setpoint. On the downside, existing stability guarantees for OFO require the controller to evolve on a sufficiently slower timescale than the plant, possibly affecting transient performance and responsiveness to disturbances. In this paper, we prove that, under suitable conditions, OFO ensures stability without any timescale separation. In particular, the condition we propose is independent of the time constant of the plant, hence it is scaling-invariant. Our analysis leverages a composite Lyapunov function, which is the $\max$ of plant-related and controller-related components. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Optimizing wheel loader performance -- an end-to-end approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wheel loaders in mines and construction sites repeatedly load soil from a pile to load receivers. Automating this task presents a challenging planning problem since each loading's performance depends on the pile state, which depends on previous loadings. We investigate an end-to-end optimization approach considering future loading outcomes and transportation costs between the pile and load receivers. To predict the evolution of the pile state and the loading performance, we use world models that leverage deep neural networks trained on numerous simulated loading cycles. A look-ahead tree search optimizes the sequence of loading actions by evaluating the performance of thousands of action candidates, which expand into subsequent action candidates under the predicted pile states recursively. Test results demonstrate that, over a horizon of 15 sequential loadings, the look-ahead tree search is 6% more efficient than a greedy strategy, which always selects the action that maximizes the current single loading performance, and 14% more efficient than using a fixed loading controller optimized for the nominal case.</description>
