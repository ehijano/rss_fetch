      <title>Hexagonal core-shell structure nanowire with high spins of spin-3/2 and spin-5/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties and hysteresis loops for the hexagonal Ising nanowire (HIN) with a core-shell structure consisting of mixed spins with the core spin being spin-5/2 and the shell spins being spin-3/2 are studied. The Blume-Capel model is considered by using the mean-field approximation (MFA) based on the Gibbs--Bogoliubov inequality for free energy. The impact of different bilinear interaction parameters ($J_{cc}, J_{ss}, J_{cs}$) between the core, shell, and core and shell spins, respectively, including the crystal ($D_c, D_s$) and external magnetic fields ($h=h_c=h_s$) at the core and shell sites, are taken into consideration. In order to obtain phase diagrams on various planes, the thermal changes of the net, core, and shell magnetizations are investigated for various values of our system parameters. It is discovered that the model exhibits only second-order phase transitions when $h=0.0$ for $D$ greater or equal to zero, first- and second-order phase transitions for $h\neq0.0$ and compensation temperatures for all $h$.</description>

      <title>Spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg distorted diamond chain with antiferromagnetic Ising and ferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exactly solvable spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg distorted diamond chain in the presence of the external magnetic field is investigated for the case of antiferromagnetic Ising and ferromagnetic XXZ Heisenberg interactions. The influence of quantum fluctuations and the distortion on the ground state, magnetic and thermal properties of the model are studied in detail. In particular, it is established that the zero-temperature magnetization curve may involve intermediate plateaus just at zero and 1/3 of the saturation magnetization. It is demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the specific heat reveals up to four distinct peaks at zero magnetic field and up to five distinct peaks at a weak magnetic field. The physical origin of all observed additional peaks of the specific heat has been clarified on the grounds of dominating thermal excitations. We have shown that the quantum fluctuations give rise to an effective geometrical frustration in this chain.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations for the Ising model on three dimensional lattices with coordination number equal 5: static and dynamic critical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we performed numerical simulations for the Ising model on three dimensional lattices with coordination number equal 5. With Monte Carlo simulations in the static case we evaluated the critical temperature and the static critical exponents $\nu$, $\gamma$ and $\beta$. Once that we have the critical temperature value we investigated the dynamical critical behavior with Glauber dynamics, starting from disordered states. From our simulations we obtained the values for the dynamic exponent $z=2.037(8)$, the exponent for the autocorrelation $\lambda/z=1.364(5)$, the exponent of the critical initial increase $\theta'=0.109(8)$ and the asymptotic value of the fluctuation-dissipation ratio $X^\infty=0.433(1)$. All of these results are in good agreement to the previous values reported for the 3D Ising model universality class.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent expansion and field-theoretic renormalization group for a singular nonlinear diffusion equation with anomalous scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of self-consistent expansions is a powerful tool for handling strong coupling problems that might otherwise be beyond the reach of perturbation theory, providing surprisingly accurate approximations even at low order. First applied in its embryonic form to fully-developed turbulence, it has subsequently been successfully applied to a variety of problems that include polymer statistics, interface dynamics and high order perturbation theory for the anharmonic oscillator. Here we show that the self-consistent expansion can be applied to singular perturbation problems arising in the theory of partial differential equations. We demonstrate its application to Barenblatt's nonlinear diffusion equation for porous media filtration, where the long-time asymptotics exhibits anomalous dimensions which can be systematically calculated using the perturbative renormalization group. We find that even the first order self-consistent expansion improves the approximation of the anomalous dimension obtained by the first order perturbative renormalization group, especially in the strong coupling regime. We also develop a field-theoretic framework for deterministic partial differential equations to facilitate the application of self-consistent expansions to other dynamic systems, and illustrate its application using the example of Barenblatt's equation. The scope of our results on the combination of renormalization group and self-consistent expansions is limited to partial differential equations whose long-time asymptotics is controlled by incomplete similarity. However, our work suggests that these methods could be applied to a broader suite of singular perturbation problems such as boundary layer theory, multiple scales analysis and matched asymptotic expansions, for which excellent approximations using renormalization group methods alone are already available.</description>

      <title>Finite size scaling of the Kuramoto model at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic scaling behavior of the Kuramoto model with finite populations has been notably elusive, despite comprehensive investigations employing both analytical and numerical methods. In this study, we explore the Kuramoto model with "deterministic" sampling of natural frequencies, employing extensive numerical simulations and report the asymptotic values of the finite-size scaling (FSS) exponents, which deviate significantly from the previously reported values in the literature. Additionally, we observe that these exponents are sensitive to the specifics of the sampling method. We discuss the origins of this variability through the self-consistent theory of the entrained oscillators.</description>

      <title>Networks with many structural scales: a Renormalization Group perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale invariance profoundly influences the dynamics and structure of complex systems, spanning from critical phenomena to network architecture. Here, we propose a precise definition of scale-invariant networks by leveraging the concept of a constant entropy loss rate across scales in a renormalization-group coarse-graining setting. This framework enables us to differentiate between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, revealing distinct characteristics within each class. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive inventory of genuinely scale-invariant networks, both natural and artificially constructed, demonstrating, e.g., that the human connectome exhibits notable features of scale invariance. Our findings open new avenues for exploring the scale-invariant structural properties crucial in biological and socio-technological systems.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariance of Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a recently proposed shifting operation on classical phase space as a gauge transformation for statistical mechanical microstates. The infinitesimal generators of the continuous gauge group form a non-commutative Lie algebra, which induces exact sum rules when thermally averaged. Gauge invariance with respect to finite shifting is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulation in the transformed phase space which generates identical equilibrium averages. Our results point towards a deeper basis of statistical mechanics than previously known and they offer avenues for systematic construction of exact identities and of sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of underdamped Brownian collisional engines: New insights and resonant phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have been proposed as alternatives for nonequilibrium nanoscale engines. However, most studies have focused on the simpler overdamped case, leaving the role of inertia much less explored. In this work, we introduce the idea of collisional engines to underdamped Brownian particles, where each stage is sequentially subjected to a distinct driving force. A careful comparison between the performance of underdamped and overdamped Brownian work-to-work engines has been undertaken. The results show that underdamped Brownian engines generally outperform their overdamped counterparts. A key difference is the presence of a resonant regime in underdamped engines, in which both efficiency and power output are enhanced across a broad set of parameters. Our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting dynamics and driving protocols to achieve optimal engine performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Hilbert space fragmentation in group-valued loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Similarities among top one day batters: physics-based quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessment of the performance of a player in any sport is very much needed to determine the ranking of players and make a solid team with the best players. Besides these, fans, journalists, sports persons, and sports councils often analyse the performances of current and retired players to identify the best players of all time. Here, we study the performance of all-time top batters in one-day cricket using physics-based statistical methods. The batters are selected in this study who possess either higher total runs or a high number of centuries. It is found that the total runs increases linearly with the innings number at the later stage of the batter carrier, and the runs rate estimated from the linear regression analysis also increases linearly with the average runs. The probability of non-scoring innings is found to be a negligibly small number (i.e., $\leq 0.1$ ) for each batter. Furthermore, based on innings-wise runs, we have computed the six-dimensional probability distribution vector for each player. Two components of the probability distribution vector vary linearly with average runs. The component representing the probability of scoring runs less than 50 linearly decreases with the average runs. In contrast, the probability of scoring runs greater than or equal to 100 and less than 150 linearly increases with the average runs. We have also estimated the entropy to assess the diversity of a player. Interestingly, the entropy varies linearly with the average runs, giving rise to two clusters corresponding to the old and recent players. Furthermore, the angle between two probability vectors is calculated for each pair of players to measure the similarities among the players. It is found that some of the players are almost identical to each other.</description>

      <title>Dynamically localized but deconfined excitations in strained classical spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical spin ice under uniaxial strain along the $[111]$ crystallographic axis. Remarkably, such strain preserves the extensive ice degeneracy and the corresponding classical Coulomb phase. The emergent monopole excitations remain thermodynamically deconfined exactly as in the isotropic case. However, their motion under local heat bath dynamics depends qualitatively on the sign of the strain. In the low-temperature limit for negative strain, the monopoles diffuse, while for positive strain, they localize. Introducing additional ring exchange dynamics into the ice background transforms the localized monopoles into sub-dimensional excitations whose motion is restricted to diffusion in the $(111)$-plane. The phenomena we identify are experimentally accessible in rare-earth pyrochlores under uniaxial pressure as well as in tripod kagome materials. The diffusive versus localized nature of the monopoles manifests in characteristic magnetic noise spectra, which we compute.</description>

      <title>Scattering Neutrinos, Spin Models, and Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Heisenberg all-to-all coupled spin models inspired by neutrino interactions in a supernova with $N$ degrees of freedom. These models are characterized by a coupling matrix that is relatively simple in the sense that there are only a few, relative to $N$, non-trivial eigenvalues, in distinction to the classic Heisenberg spin-glass models, leading to distinct behavior in both the high-temperature and low-temperature regimes. When the momenta of the neutrinos are uniform and random in directions, we can calculate the large-$N$ partition function for the quantum Heisenberg model. In particular, the high-temperature partition function predicts a non-Gaussian density of states, providing interesting counter-examples showing the limits of general theorems on the density of states for quantum spin models. We can repeat the same argument for classical Heisenberg models, also known as rotor models, and we find the high-temperature expansion is completely controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix, and again predicts non-Gaussian behavior for the density of states as long as the number of eigenvalues does not scale linearly with $N$. Indeed, we derive the amusing fact that these \emph{thermodynamic} partition functions are essentially the generating function for counting permutations in the high-temperature regime. Finally, for the case relevant to neutrinos in a supernova, we identify the low-temperature phase as a unique state with the direction of the momenta of the neutrino dictating its coherent state in flavor-space, a state we dub the "flavor-momentum-locked" state.</description>

      <title>The localized phase of the Anderson model on the Bethe lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Anderson model on the Bethe lattice, focusing on the localized regime. Employing the cavity approach, we derive compact expressions for the inverse participation ratios (IPRs) that are equivalent to those obtained using the supersymmetric formalism and naturally facilitate a highly efficient computational scheme. This method yields numerical results with unprecedented accuracy, even very close to the localization threshold. Our approach allows for high-precision validation of all theoretical predictions from the analytical solution, including the finite jump of the IPRs at the transition. Additionally, we reveal a singular behavior of the IPRs near the critical point that has not been previously reported in the literature. This singular behavior is further confirmed by the numerical solution of the non-linear $\sigma$ model on the Bethe lattice, which provides an effective description of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent planar thermal Hall effect by quasi-ballistic phonons in black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP) calls for a minimal mechanism with no role for spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The long phonon mean-free-path leaves little room for scattering by point-like symmetry breaking defects. we show that the signal peaks when the magnetic field is oriented along one of the two diagonal orientations of the puckered honeycomb plane and argue that this can be understood as the sum of two distinct contributions each parallel to a mirror plane. This angular dependence as well as the order of magnitude of the observed signal points to the torque exerted by magnetic field on electric dipoles traveling with heat-carrying phonons as the driver of the effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that metachronal waves (MCWs) can emerge from a chain of symmetrically beating nematodes aligned at the edge of sessile droplets. Our study, employing a coupled elastohydrodynamic model of active filaments, elucidates that a misalignment caused by a tilt against the bounding wall disrupts the synchronization and generates a constant time lag between adjacent filaments, leading to MCWs. The MCWs, enhancing the fluid circulation, achieve their maximum thermodynamic efficiency over the same range of tilt angles observed in the nematode experiments.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable approach to monitored quantum dynamics and entanglement phase transitions</title>

Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits have stimulated activity in a diverse research community. However, the study of measurement-induced dynamics, due to the requirement of exponentially complex postselection, has been experimentally limited to small or specially designed systems that can be efficiently simulated classically. We present a solution to this outstanding problem by introducing a scalable protocol in $U(1)$ symmetric circuits that facilitates the observation of entanglement phase transitions \emph{directly} from experimental data, without detailed assumptions of the underlying model or benchmarking with simulated data. Thus, the method is applicable to circuits which do not admit efficient classical simulation and allows a reconstruction of the full entanglement entropy curve with minimal theoretical input. Our approach relies on adaptive circuits and a steering protocol to approximate pure-state trajectories with mixed ensembles, from which one can efficiently filter out the subsystem $U(1)$ charge fluctuations of the target trajectory to obtain its entanglement entropy. The steering protocol replaces the exponential costs of postselection and state tomography with a scalable overhead which, for fixed accuracy $\epsilon$ and circuit size $L$, scales as $\mathcal{N}_s\sim L^{5/2}/\epsilon$.</description>

Abstract: The theory of quantum thermodynamics investigates how the concepts of heat, work, and temperature can be carried over to the quantum realm, where fluctuations and randomness are fundamentally unavoidable. These lecture notes provide an introduction to the thermodynamics of small quantum systems. It is illustrated how the laws of thermodynamics emerge from quantum theory and how open quantum systems can be modeled by Markovian master equations. Quantum systems that are designed to perform a certain task, such as cooling or generating entanglement are considered. Finally, the effect of fluctuations on the thermodynamic description is discussed.</description>

Abstract: One of the hypothesized functions of biomolecular condensates is to act as chemical reactors, where chemical reactions can be modulated, i.e. accelerated or slowed down, while substrate molecules enter and products exit from the condensate. Likewise, the components themselves that take part in the architectural integrity of condensates might be modified by active (energy consuming, non-equilibrium) processes, e.g. by ATPase chaperones or by kinases and phosphatases. In this work, we study how the presence of spatial inhomogeneities, such as in the case of liquid-liquid phase separation, affects active chemical reactions and results in the presence of directional flows of matter, which are one of the hallmarks of non-equilibirum processes. We establish the minimal conditions for the existence of such spatial currents, and we furthermore find that these fluxes are maximal at the condensate interface. These results propose that some condensates might be most efficient as chemical factories due to their interfaces rather than their volumes, and could suggest a possible biological reason for the the observed abundance of small non-fusing condensates inside the cell, thus maximizing their surface and the associated fluxes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars orbiting a supermassive black hole in the center of galaxies undergo very efficient diffusion in their orbital orientations. This is "Vector Resonant Relaxation", a diffusion process formally occurring on the unit sphere. Such a dynamics is intrinsically non-linear, stochastic, and correlated, hence bearing deep similarities with turbulence in fluid mechanics or plasma physics. In that context, we show how generic methods stemming from statistical closure theory, namely the celebrated "Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism", can be used to characterize the correlations describing the redistribution of orbital orientations. In particular, limiting ourselves to the leading order truncation in this closure scheme, the so-called "Direct Interaction Approximation", and placing ourselves in the limit of an isotropic distribution of orientations, we explicitly compare the associated prediction for the two-point correlation function with measures from numerical simulations. We discuss the successes and limitations of this approach and present possible future venues.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of Generalized Elephant Random Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elephant random walk is a special type of random walk that incorporates the memory of the past to determine its future steps. The probability of this walk taking a particular step (+1 or -1) at a time point, conditioned on the entire history, depends on a linear function of the proportion of that step till that time point. In this work, we investigate how the dynamics of the random walk will change if we replace this linear function by a generic map satisfying some analytic conditions. We also propose a new model, called the multidimensional generalized elephant random walk, that incorporates several variants of elephant random walk in one and higher dimensions and their generalizations thereof. Using tools from the theory of stochastic approximation, we derive the asymptotic behavior of our model leading to newer results on the phase transition boundary between diffusive and superdiffusive regimes. We also mention a few open problems in this context.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in Hydrodynamics from Micro- to Macroscale: Wisdom from Boltzmann and Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that macroscopic irreversible thermodynamics for viscous fluids can be derived from exact information-theoretic thermodynamic identities valid at the microscale. Entropy production, in particular, is a measure of the loss of many-particle correlations in the same way in which it measures the loss of system-reservoirs correlations in stochastic thermodynamics (ST). More specifically, we first show that boundary conditions at the macroscopic level define a natural decomposition of the entropy production rate (EPR) in terms of thermodynamic forces multiplying their conjugate currents, as well as a change in suitable nonequilibrium potential that acts as a Lyapunov function in the absence of forces. Moving to the microscale, we identify the exact identities at the origin of these dissipative contributions for isolated Hamiltonian systems. We then show that the molecular chaos hypothesis, which gives rise to the Boltzmann equation at the mesoscale, leads to a positive rate of loss of many-particle correlations, which we identify with the Boltzmann EPR. By generalizing the Boltzmann equation to account for boundaries with nonuniform temperature and nonzero velocity, and resorting to the Chapman-Enskog expansion, we recover the macroscopic theory we started from. Finally, using a linearized Boltzmann equation we derive ST for dilute particles in a weakly out-of-equilibrium fluid and its corresponding macroscopic thermodynamics. Our work unambiguously demonstrates the information-theoretical origin of thermodynamic notions of entropy and dissipation in macroscale irreversible thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Dynamics in Monitored Systems and the Role of Quantum Jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitored quantum many-body systems display a rich pattern of entanglement dynamics, which is unique to this non-unitary setting. This work studies the effect of quantum jumps on the entanglement dynamics beyond the no-click limit corresponding to a deterministic non-Hermitian evolution. We consider two examples, a monitored SSH model and a quantum Ising chain, for which we show the jumps have remarkably different effects on the entanglement despite having the same statistics as encoded in their waiting-time distribution. To understand this difference, we introduce a new metric, the statistics of entanglement gain and loss due to jumps and non-Hermitian evolution. This insight allows us to build a simple stochastic model of a random walk with partial resetting, which reproduces the entanglement dynamics, and to dissect the mutual role of jumps and non-Hermitian evolution on the entanglement scaling. We demonstrate that significant deviations from the no-click limit arise whenever quantum jumps strongly renormalize the non-Hermitian dynamics, as in the case of the SSH model at weak monitoring or in the Ising chain at large transverse field. On the other hand, we show that the weak monitoring phase of the Ising chain leads to a robust sub-volume logarithmic phase due to weakly renormalized non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The critical behavior of a dimer model with an interaction favoring parallel dimers in each plaquette of the square lattice is studied numerically by means of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. The critical exponents are known to depend on the chemical potential of vacancies, or monomers. At large average density of the latter, the phase transition becomes of first-order. We compute the scaling dimensions of both order parameter and temperature in the second order regime and compare them with the conjecture that the critical behavior is the same as the Ashkin-Teller model on its self-dual critical line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating stochastic systems with feedback control is challenging due to the complex interplay between the system's dynamics and the feedback-dependent control protocols. We present a single-step-trajectory probability analysis to time-dependent stochastic systems. Based on this analysis, we revisit several time-dependent kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms designed for systems under open-loop-control protocols. Our analysis provides an unified alternative proof to these algorithms, summarized into a pedagogical tutorial. Moreover, with the trajectory probability analysis, we present a novel feedback-controlled KMC algorithm that accurately captures the dynamics systems controlled by external signal based on measurements of the system's state. Our method correctly captures the system dynamics and avoids the artificial Zeno effect that arises from incorrectly applying the direct Gillespie algorithm to feedback-controlled systems. This work provides a unified perspective on existing open-loop-control KMC algorithms and also offers a powerful and accurate tool for simulating stochastic systems with feedback control.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of frustrated Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions in generalized triangular lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model with nearest-neighbor interaction $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ in two kinds of generalized triangular lattices (GTLs) employing the Wang--Landau Monte Carlo method and finite-size scaling analysis. In the first GTL (GTL1), featuring anisotropic properties, we identify three kinds of super-antiferromagnetic ground states with stripe structures. Meanwhile, in the second GTL (GTL2), which is non-regular in next-nearest-neighbor interaction, the ferrimagnetic 3$\times$3 and two kinds of partial spin liquid ground states are observed. We confirm that residual entropy is proportional to the number of spins in the partial spin liquid ground states. Additionally, we construct finite-temperature phase diagrams for ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. In GTL1, the transition into the ferromagnetic phase is continuous, contrasting with the first-order transition into the stripe phase. In GTL2, the critical temperature into the ferromagnetic ground state decreases as antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interaction intensifies until it meets the 3$\times$3 phase boundary. For intermediate values of the next-nearest-neighbor interaction, two successive transitions emerge: one from the paramagnetic phase to the ferromagnetic phase, followed by the other transition from the ferromagnetic phase to the 3$\times$3 phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy increase is fundamentally related to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. By adding the 'extra dimension' associated with thermodynamic forces, we extend that discrete symmetry to a continuous symmetry for the dynamical fluctuations around (nonlinear) gradient flow. The latter connects macroscopic equilibrium conditions upon introducing a quasistatic protocol of control parameters. The entropy state function becomes the Noether charge. As a result, and following ideas expressed by Shin-ichi Sasa and co-workers, the adiabatic invariance of the entropy, part of the Clausius heat theorem, gets connected with the Noether theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the transition from the delocalized to the many-body localized (MBL) phase is an important unresolved issue. To probe the nature of the MBL transition, we investigate the universal properties of single-particle excitations produced in highly excited many-body eigenstates of a disordered interacting quantum many-body system. In a class of one-dimensional spinless fermionic models with random disorder, we study the finite size scaling of the ratio of typical to average values of the single-particle local density of states and the scattering rates across the MBL transition. Our results indicate that the MBL transition in this class of one-dimensional models of spinless fermions is continuous in nature. For various ranges of interactions in the system, the critical exponent $\nu$ with which the correlation length $\xi$ diverges at the transition point $W_c$, $\xi \sim |W-W_c|^{-\nu}$, satisfies the Chayes-Chayes-Fisher-Spencer(CCFS) bound $\nu \ge 2/d$ where $d$ is the physical dimension of the system. We also discuss why the critical exponent obtained from finite-size scaling of the conventional diagnostic of many-body localization, the level-spacing ratio, strongly violates the CCFS bound while the single-particle density of states and scattering rates are consistent with the CCFS criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We begin a systematic investigation of quench dynamics in higher-dimensional lattice systems considering the case of non-interacting fermions with conserved particle number. We prepare the system in a translational-invariant non-equilibrium initial state -- the simplest example being a classical configuration with fermions at fixed positions on the lattice -- and let it to evolve in time. We characterise the system's dynamics by measuring the entanglement between a finite connected region and its complement. We observe the transmutation of entanglement entropy into thermodynamic entropy and investigate how this process depends on the shape and orientation of the region with respect to the underlying lattice. Interestingly, we find that irregular regions display a distinctive multi-slope entanglement growth, while the dependence on the orientation angle is generically fairly weak. This is particularly true for regions with a large (discrete) rotational symmetry group. The main tool of our analysis is the celebrated quasiparticle picture of Calabrese and Cardy, which we generalise to describe the case at hand. Specifically, we show that for generic initial configurations (even when restricting to classical ones) one has to allow for the production of multiplets involving ${n&gt;2}$ quasiparticles and carrying non-diagonal correlations. We obtain quantitatively accurate predictions -- tested against exact numerics -- and propose an efficient Monte Carlo-based scheme to evaluate them for arbitrary connected regions of generic higher dimensional lattices.</description>

Abstract: Exploring operational regimes of many-body cavity QED with multi-level atoms remains an exciting research frontier for their enhanced storage capabilities of intra-level quantum correlations. In this work, we consider an experimentally feasible many-body cavity QED model describing a four-level system, where each of those levels is formed from a combination of different spin and momentum states of ultra-cold atoms in a cavity. The resulting model comprises a pair of Dicke Hamiltonians constructed from pseudo-spin operators, effectively capturing two intertwined superradiant phase transitions. The phase diagram reveals regions featuring weak and strong entangled states of spin and momentum atomic degrees of freedom. These states exhibit different dynamical responses, ranging from slow to fast relaxation, with the added option of persistent entanglement temporal oscillations. We discuss the role of cavity losses in steering the system's dynamics into such entangled states and propose a readout scheme that leverages different light polarizations within the cavity. Our work paves the way to connect the rich variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body cavity QED to the buildup of quantum correlations in systems with multi-level atom descriptions.</description>

      <title>Excitonic quantum criticality: from bilayer graphene to narrow Chern bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of excitonic quantum phase transitions describing the evolution of a bilayer metallic state to an inter-layer coherent state where excitons condense. We argue that such transitions can be continuous and exhibit a non-Fermi liquid counterflow response ${\rho_{\mathrm{counterflow}}(\omega)\sim\omega^{2/z}}$ that directly encodes the dynamical critical exponent $z$. Our calculations are performed within a controlled expansion around $z = 2$. This physics is relevant to any system with spin, valley, or layer degrees of freedom. We consider two contexts for excitonic quantum criticality: (1) a weakly interacting graphene bilayer, and (2) a system of two narrow, half-filled Chern bands at zero external magnetic field, with total Chern number $C_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$, which may soon be realizable in moir\'{e} materials. The latter system hosts a time-reversed pair of composite Fermi liquid states, and the condensation of excitons of the composite fermions leads to an exotic exciton insulator* state with a charge neutral Fermi surface. Our work sheds new light on the physics of inter-layer coherence transitions in 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: We present a scheme for investigating arbitrary thermal observables in spatially inhomogeneous equilibrium many-body systems. Extending the grand canonical ensemble yields any given observable as an explicit hyper-density functional. Associated local fluctuation profiles follow from an exact hyper-Ornstein-Zernike equation. While the local compressibility and simple observables permit analytic treatment, complex order parameters are accessible via simulation-based supervised machine learning of neural hyper-direct correlation functionals. We exemplify efficient and accurate neural predictions for the cluster statistics of hard rods, square well rods, and hard spheres. The theory allows to treat complex observables, as is impossible in standard density functional theory.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of the Mayer Series Coefficients for a Dimer Gas on a Rectangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05388</link>

Abstract: This paper continues and complements the research in the earlier version of this paper
  (essentially Part 3 and Part 4 herein.) We now assume as suggested at the end of Part 4 that $b(n)$ is asymptotically of the form in eq.(A1).
  \begin{equation}\label{A1} \tag{A1}
  (-1)^{n+1} * b(n) \sim \exp{( k_{-1} n + k_{0} ln(n) + \frac{k_{1}}{n} + \frac{k_{2}}{n^{2}}...)} \end{equation} Using the details of the six approximations used in Part 3, corresponding to the six values of $r$, $ 1 \leq r \leq 6$, in dimensions $d$ equal $2$. $3$, $5$, $11$ and $20$ we find in Part 1 an approximate value for the right side of eq.(A1) keeping the three terms in the exponent in $k_{-1}$, $k_{0}$, and $k_{1}$. In the range $5 \leq n \leq 20$ the two sides of eq.(A1) may be said to agree roughly to 5 parts per 100. ( With an appropriate choice of a constant of proportionality. )
  In Part 2 an approximation is found keeping the term in $k_{2}$ also that may be said to agree to 5 parts in 1000 in the range $8 \leq n \leq 20$. Not only is it amazing that the relation in eq.(A1) seems to hold, it is equally amazing that it is so accurate for such small values of $n$.</description>

      <title>Odd Dipole Screening in Radial Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of "Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations using an annealing-based approach is based on solving generalized eigenvalue problems. When a partial differential equation is discretized, it leads to a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be expressed as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be converted into an optimization problem with the objective function being a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm allows the computation of eigenvectors at arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables using an Ising machine. Simple examples solved using this method and theoretical analysis provide a guideline for appropriate parameter settings.</description>
