      <title>Reproducibility and scientific interpretation in the age of AI: consilience in biological systematics, ecology, and molecular biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving complete reproducibility in science, particularly in research fields such as biodiversity, is challenging due to analytical choices, bias and interpretation. Here, we examine examples of reproducibility in biological systematics, ecology, and molecular biology. To mitigate the impact of interpretation and analytical choices, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has provided potential tools. In the present work, while emphasizing the need for methodological rigor and transparency, we acknowledge the role of interpretation in activities such as coding biological characters and detecting morphological patterns in nature. We explore the opportunities and limitations associated with the synergy between big data and AI in molecular biology, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive and integrated approach based on dataset quality and usefulness. We conclude by advocating for AI-based tools to assist biologists, reinforcing consilience as a criterion for scientific validity without hindering scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Investigation of a two-patch within-host model of hepatitis B viral infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) can lead to formation of abnormal nodular structures within the liver. To address how changes in liver anatomy affect overall virus-host dynamics, we developed within-host ordinary differential equation models of two-patch hepatitis B infection, one that assumes irreversible and one that assumes reversible movement between nodular structures. We investigated the models analytically and numerically, and determined the contribution of patch susceptibility, immune responses, and virus movement on within-patch and whole-liver virus dynamics. We explored the structural and practical identifiability of the models by implementing a differential algebra approach and the Monte Carlo approach for a specific HBV data set. We determined conditions for viral clearance, viral localization, and systemic viral infection. Our study suggests that cell susceptibility to infection within modular structures, the movement rate between patches, and the immune-mediated infected cell killing have the most influence on HBV dynamics. Our results can help inform intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>FedCVD++: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction with Parametric and Non-Parametric Model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1) tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%, (2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles, and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81) matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated under real-world clinical constraints.</description>
