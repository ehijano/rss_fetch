      <title>Revisiting Performance Models of Distal Pointing Tasks in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance models of interaction, such as Fitts Law, are important tools for predicting and explaining human motor performance and for designing high-performance user interfaces. Extensive prior work has proposed such models for the 3D interaction task of distal pointing, in which the user points their hand or a device at a distant target in order to select it. However, there is no consensus on how to compute the index of difficulty for distal pointing tasks. We present a preliminary study suggesting that existing models may not be sufficient to model distal pointing performance with current virtual reality technologies. Based on these results, we hypothesized that both the form of the model and the standard method for collecting empirical data for pointing tasks might need to change in order to achieve a more accurate and valid distal pointing model. In our main study, we used a new methodology to collect distal pointing data and evaluated traditional models, purely ballistic models, and two-part models. Ultimately, we found that the best model used a simple Fitts-Law-style index of difficulty with angular measures of amplitude and width.</description>

      <title>Coupling the Heart to Musical Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biofeedback is being used more recently as a general control paradigm for human-computer interfaces (HCIs). While biofeedback especially from breath has seen increasing uptake as a controller for novel musical interfaces, new interfaces for musical expression (NIMEs), the community has not given as much attention to the heart. The heart is just as intimate a part of music as breath and it is argued that the heart determines our perception of time and so indirectly our perception of music. Inspired by this I demonstrate a photoplethysmogram (PPG)-based NIME controller using heart rate as a 1D control parameter to transform the qualities of sounds in real-time over a Bluetooth wireless HCI. I apply time scaling to "warp" audio buffers inbound to the sound card, and play these transformed audio buffers back to the listener wearing the PPG sensor, creating a hypothetical perceptual biofeedback loop: changes in sound change heart rate to change PPG measurements to change sound. I discuss how a sound-heart-PPG biofeedback loop possibly affords greater control and/or variety of movements with a 1D controller, how controlling the space and/or time scale of sound playback with biofeedback makes for possibilities in performance ambience, and I briefly discuss generative latent spaces as a possible way to extend a 1D PPG control space.</description>

      <title>Cognitio Emergens: Agency, Dimensions, and Dynamics in Human-AI Knowledge Co-Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific knowledge creation is fundamentally transforming as humans and AI systems evolve beyond tool-user relationships into co-evolutionary epistemic partnerships. When AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure prediction, researchers described engaging with an epistemic partner that reshaped how they conceptualized fundamental relationships. This article introduces Cognitio Emergens (CE), a framework addressing critical limitations in existing models that focus on static roles or narrow metrics while failing to capture how scientific understanding emerges through recursive human-AI interaction over time. CE integrates three components addressing these limitations: Agency Configurations describing how authority distributes between humans and AI (Directed, Contributory, Partnership), with partnerships dynamically oscillating between configurations rather than following linear progression; Epistemic Dimensions capturing six specific capabilities emerging through collaboration across Discovery, Integration, and Projection axes, creating distinctive "capability signatures" that guide development; and Partnership Dynamics identifying forces shaping how these relationships evolve, particularly the risk of epistemic alienation where researchers lose interpretive control over knowledge they formally endorse. Drawing from autopoiesis theory, social systems theory, and organizational modularity, CE reveals how knowledge co-creation emerges through continuous negotiation of roles, values, and organizational structures. By reconceptualizing human-AI scientific collaboration as fundamentally co-evolutionary, CE offers a balanced perspective that neither uncritically celebrates nor unnecessarily fears AI's evolving role, instead providing conceptual tools for cultivating partnerships that maintain meaningful human participation while enabling transformative scientific breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>Do ATCOs Need Explanations, and Why? Towards ATCO-Centered Explainable AI for Conflict Resolution Advisories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is surging. Prior research has primarily focused on systems' ability to generate explanations, often guided by researchers' intuitions rather than end-users' needs. Unfortunately, such approaches have not yielded favorable outcomes when compared to a black-box baseline (i.e., no explanation). To address this gap, this paper advocates a human-centered approach that shifts focus to air traffic controllers (ATCOs) by asking a fundamental yet overlooked question: Do ATCOs need explanations, and if so, why? Insights from air traffic management (ATM), human-computer interaction, and the social sciences were synthesized to provide a holistic understanding of XAI challenges and opportunities in ATM. Evaluating 11 ATM operational goals revealed a clear need for explanations when ATCOs aim to document decisions and rationales for future reference or report generation. Conversely, ATCOs are less likely to seek them when their conflict resolution approach align with the artificial intelligence (AI) advisory. While this is a preliminary study, the findings are expected to inspire broader and deeper inquiries into the design of ATCO-centric XAI systems, paving the way for more effective human-AI interaction in ATM.</description>

      <title>InfoVids: Reimagining the Viewer Experience with Alternative Visualization-Presenter Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional data presentations typically separate the presenter and visualization into two separate spaces--the 3D world and a 2D screen--enforcing visualization-centric stories. To create a more human-centric viewing experience, we establish a more equitable relationship between the visualization and the presenter through our InfoVids. These infographics-inspired informational videos are crafted to redefine relationships between the presenter and visualizations. As we design InfoVids, we explore how the use of layout, form, and interactions affects the viewer experience. We compare InfoVids against their baseline 2D `slides' equivalents across 9 metrics with 30 participants and provide practical, long-term insights from an autobiographical perspective. Our mixed methods analyses reveal that this paradigm reduced viewer attention splitting, shifted the focus from the visualization to the presenter, and led to more interactive, natural, and engaging full-body data performances for viewers. Ultimately, InfoVids helped viewers re-imagine traditional dynamics between the presenter and visualizations.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Sensing and Intervention Paradigm: A Review of Closed-Loop Approaches for Ingestion Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ingestive behavior plays a critical role in health, yet many existing interventions remain limited to static guidance or manual self-tracking. With the increasing integration of sensors and perceptual computing, recent systems have begun to support closed-loop interventions that dynamically sense user behavior and provide feedback during or around ingestion episodes. In this survey, we review 136 studies that leverage sensor-enabled or interaction-mediated approaches to influence eating behavior. We propose a behavioral closed-loop paradigm comprising three core components: target behaviors, sensing modalities, and feedback strategies. A taxonomy of sensing and intervention modalities is presented, organized along human- and environment-based dimensions. Our analysis also examines evaluation methods and design trends across different modality-behavior pairings. This review reveals prevailing patterns and critical gaps, offering design insights for future adaptive and context-aware ingestion health interventions.</description>

      <title>DroidRetriever: An Autonomous Navigation and Information Integration System Facilitating Mobile Sensemaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users regularly rely on mobile applications for their daily information needs, and mobile sensemaking is prevalent in various domains such as education, healthcare, business intelligence, and emergency response, where timely and context-aware information-processing and decision-making is critical. However, valuable information is often scattered across the closed ecosystems within various applications, posing challenges for traditional search engines to retrieve data openly and in real-time. Additionally, due to limitations such as mobile device screen sizes, language differences, and unfamiliarity with specific applications and domain knowledge, users have to frequently switch between multiple applications and spend substantial time locating and integrating the information. To address these challenges, we present DroidRetriever, a system for cross-application information retrieval to facilitate mobile sensemaking. DroidRetriever can automatically navigate to relevant interfaces based on users' natural language commands, capture screenshots, extract and integrate information, and finally present the results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DroidRetriever can extract and integrate information with near-human accuracy while significantly reducing processing time. Furthermore, with minimal user intervention, DroidRetriever effectively corrects and completes various information retrieval tasks, substantially reducing the user's workload. Our summary of the motivations for intervention and the discussion of their necessity provide valuable implications for future research. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Feedback in Counselling Competence Training of Prospective Teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of AI-based feedback to enhance the counselling competence of prospective teachers. An iterative block seminar was designed, incorporating theoretical foundations, practical applications, and AI tools for analysing verbal, paraverbal, and nonverbal communication. The seminar included recorded simulated teacher-parent conversations, followed by AI-based feedback and qualitative interviews with students. The study investigated correlations between communication characteristics and conversation quality, student perceptions of AI-based feedback, and the training of AI models to identify conversation phases and techniques. Results indicated significant correlations between nonverbal and paraverbal features and conversation quality, and students positively perceived the AI feedback. The findings suggest that AI-based feedback can provide objective, actionable insights to improve teacher training programs. Future work will focus on refining verbal skill annotations, expanding the dataset, and exploring additional features to enhance the feedback system.</description>

      <title>manvr3d: A Platform for Human-in-the-loop Cell Tracking in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose manvr3d, a novel VR-ready platform for interactive human-in-the-loop cell tracking. We utilize VR controllers and eye-tracking hardware to facilitate rapid ground truth generation and proofreading for deep learning-based cell tracking models. Life scientists reconstruct the developmental history of organisms on the cellular level by analyzing 3D time-lapse microscopy images acquired at high spatio-temporal resolution. The reconstruction of such cell lineage trees traditionally involves tracking individual cells through all recorded time points, manually annotating their positions, and then linking them over time to create complete trajectories. Deep learning-based algorithms accelerate this process, yet depend heavily on manually-annotated high-quality ground truth data and curation. Visual representation of the image data in this process still relies primarily on 2D renderings, which greatly limits spatial understanding and navigation. In this work, we bridge the gap between deep learning-based cell tracking software and 3D/VR visualization to create a human-in-the-loop cell tracking system. We lift the incremental annotation, training and proofreading loop of the deep learning model into the 3rd dimension and apply natural user interfaces like hand gestures and eye tracking to accelerate the cell tracking workflow for life scientists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public deliberation, as in open discussion of issues of public concern, often suffers from scattered and shallow discourse, poor sensemaking, and a disconnect from actionable policy outcomes. This paper introduces BCause, a discussion system leveraging generative AI and human-machine collaboration to transform unstructured dialogue around public issues (such as urban living, policy changes, and current socio-economic transformations) into structured, actionable democratic processes. We present three innovations: (i) importing and transforming unstructured transcripts into argumentative discussions, (ii) geo-deliberated problem-sensing via a Telegram bot for local issue reporting, and (iii) smart reporting with customizable widgets (e.g., summaries, topic modelling, policy recommendations, clustered arguments). The system's human-AI partnership preserves critical human participation to ensure ethical oversight, contextual relevance, and creative synthesis.</description>

      <title>Scalable Class-Centric Visual Interactive Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large unlabeled datasets demand efficient and scalable data labeling solutions, in particular when the number of instances and classes is large. This leads to significant visual scalability challenges and imposes a high cognitive load on the users. Traditional instance-centric labeling methods, where (single) instances are labeled in each iteration struggle to scale effectively in these scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce cVIL, a Class-Centric Visual Interactive Labeling methodology designed for interactive visual data labeling. By shifting the paradigm from assigning-classes-to-instances to assigning-instances-to-classes, cVIL reduces labeling effort and enhances efficiency for annotators working with large, complex and class-rich datasets. We propose a novel visual analytics labeling interface built on top of the conceptual cVIL workflow, enabling improved scalability over traditional visual labeling. In a user study, we demonstrate that cVIL can improve labeling efficiency and user satisfaction over instance-centric interfaces. The effectiveness of cVIL is further demonstrated through a usage scenario, showcasing its potential to alleviate cognitive load and support experts in managing extensive labeling tasks efficiently.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Foveated Frame Rate Reduction in Virtual Reality for Head-Mounted Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foveated rendering methods usually reduce spatial resolution in the periphery of the users' view. However, using foveated rendering to reduce temporal resolution, i.e., rendering frame rate, seems less explored. In this work, we present the results of a user study investigating the perceptual effects of foveated temporal resolution reduction, where only the temporal resolution (frame rate) is reduced in the periphery without affecting spatial quality (pixel density). In particular, we investigated the perception of temporal resolution artifacts caused by reducing the frame rate dependent on the eccentricity of the user's gaze. Our user study with 15 participants was conducted in a virtual reality setting using a head-mounted display. Our results indicate that it was possible to reduce average rendering costs, i.e., the number of rendered pixels, to a large degree before participants consistently reported perceiving temporal artifacts.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Coordination Strategies for Underground Automated Vehicle Fleets in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficiency and safety outcomes of implementing different adaptive coordination models for automated vehicle (AV) fleets, managed by a centralized coordinator that dynamically responds to human-controlled vehicle behavior. The simulated scenarios replicate an underground mining environment characterized by narrow tunnels with limited connectivity. To address the unique challenges of such settings, we propose a novel metric - Path Overlap Density (POD) - to predict efficiency and potentially the safety performance of AV fleets. The study also explores the impact of map features on AV fleets performance. The results demonstrate that both AV fleet coordination strategies and underground tunnel network characteristics significantly influence overall system performance. While map features are critical for optimizing efficiency, adaptive coordination strategies are essential for ensuring safe operations.</description>

      <title>Navigating Privacy and Trust: AI Assistants as Social Support for Older Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI assistants are increasingly integrated into older adults' daily lives, offering new opportunities for social support and accessibility while raising important questions about privacy, autonomy, and trust. As these systems become embedded in caregiving and social networks, older adults must navigate trade-offs between usability, data privacy, and personal agency across different interaction contexts. Although prior work has explored AI assistants' potential benefits, further research is needed to understand how perceived usefulness and risk shape adoption and engagement. This paper examines these dynamics and advocates for participatory design approaches that position older adults as active decision makers in shaping AI assistant functionality. By advancing a framework for privacy-aware, user-centered AI design, this work contributes to ongoing discussions on developing ethical and transparent AI systems that enhance well-being without compromising user control.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of AI-Powered Audiovisual Personalization on Learner Emotion, Focus, and Learning Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent learners often struggle with sustaining focus and emotional regulation in unstructured or distracting settings. Although some rely on ambient aids such as music, ASMR, or visual backgrounds to support concentration, these tools are rarely integrated into cohesive, learner-centered systems. Moreover, existing educational technologies focus primarily on content adaptation and feedback, overlooking the emotional and sensory context in which learning takes place. Large language models have demonstrated powerful multimodal capabilities including the ability to generate and adapt text, audio, and visual content. Educational research has yet to fully explore their potential in creating personalized audiovisual learning environments. To address this gap, we introduce an AI-powered system that uses LLMs to generate personalized multisensory study environments. Users select or generate customized visual themes (e.g., abstract vs. realistic, static vs. animated) and auditory elements (e.g., white noise, ambient ASMR, familiar vs. novel sounds) to create immersive settings aimed at reducing distraction and enhancing emotional stability. Our primary research question investigates how combinations of personalized audiovisual elements affect learner cognitive load and engagement. Using a mixed-methods design that incorporates biometric measures and performance outcomes, this study evaluates the effectiveness of LLM-driven sensory personalization. The findings aim to advance emotionally responsive educational technologies and extend the application of multimodal LLMs into the sensory dimension of self-directed learning.</description>

      <title>VISLIX: An XAI Framework for Validating Vision Models with Slice Discovery and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world machine learning models require rigorous evaluation before deployment, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and surveillance. The evaluation of machine learning models often focuses on data slices, which are subsets of the data that share a set of characteristics. Data slice finding automatically identifies conditions or data subgroups where models underperform, aiding developers in mitigating performance issues. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, data slicing for vision model validation faces several challenges. First, data slicing often needs additional image metadata or visual concepts, and falls short in certain computer vision tasks, such as object detection. Second, understanding data slices is a labor-intensive and mentally demanding process that heavily relies on the expert's domain knowledge. Third, data slicing lacks a human-in-the-loop solution that allows experts to form hypothesis and test them interactively. To overcome these limitations and better support the machine learning operations lifecycle, we introduce VISLIX, a novel visual analytics framework that employs state-of-the-art foundation models to help domain experts analyze slices in computer vision models. Our approach does not require image metadata or visual concepts, automatically generates natural language insights, and allows users to test data slice hypothesis interactively. We evaluate VISLIX with an expert study and three use cases, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool in providing comprehensive insights for validating object detection models.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Large Language Models on K-12 Education in Rural India: A Thematic Analysis of Student Volunteer's Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-driven education, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to address learning disparities in rural K-12 schools. However, research on AI adoption in rural India remains limited, with existing studies focusing primarily on urban settings. This study examines the perceptions of volunteer teachers on AI integration in rural education, identifying key challenges and opportunities. Through semi-structured interviews with 23 volunteer educators in Rajasthan and Delhi, we conducted a thematic analysis to explore infrastructure constraints, teacher preparedness, and digital literacy gaps. Findings indicate that while LLMs could enhance personalized learning and reduce teacher workload, barriers such as poor connectivity, lack of AI training, and parental skepticism hinder adoption. Despite concerns over over-reliance and ethical risks, volunteers emphasize that AI should be seen as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional teaching. Given the potential benefits, LLM-based tutors merit further exploration in rural classrooms, with structured implementation and localized adaptations to ensure accessibility and equity.</description>

      <title>Patterns and Mechanisms of Contrastive Activation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to their inherent complexity and opacity. While techniques like fine-tuning can modify model behavior, they typically require extensive computational resources. Recent work has introduced a class of contrastive activation engineering (CAE) techniques as promising approaches for steering LLM outputs through targeted modifications to their internal representations. Applied at inference-time with zero cost, CAE has the potential to introduce a new paradigm of flexible, task-specific LLM behavior tuning. We analyze the performance of CAE in in-distribution, out-of-distribution settings, evaluate drawbacks, and begin to develop comprehensive guidelines for its effective deployment. We find that 1. CAE is only reliably effective when applied to in-distribution contexts. 2. Increasing the number of samples used to generate steering vectors has diminishing returns at around 80 samples. 3. Steering vectors are susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverses the behavior that is steered for. 4. Steering vectors harm the overall model perplexity. 5. Larger models are more resistant to steering-induced degradation.</description>

      <title>Chess variation entropy and engine relevance for humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern chess engines significantly outperform human players and are essential for evaluating positions and move quality. These engines assign a numerical evaluation $E$ to positions, indicating an advantage for either white or black, but similar evaluations can mask varying levels of move complexity. While some move sequences are straightforward, others demand near-perfect play, limiting the practical value of these evaluations for most players. To quantify this problem, we use entropy to measure the complexity of the principal variation (the sequence of best moves). Variations with forced moves have low entropy, while those with multiple viable alternatives have high entropy. Our results show that, except for experts, most human players struggle with high-entropy variations, especially when $|E|&lt;100$ centipawns, which accounts for about $2/3$ of positions. This underscores the need for AI-generated evaluations to convey the complexity of underlying move sequences, as they often exceed typical human cognitive capabilities, reducing their practical utility.</description>

      <title>Tell Me the Good Stuff: User Preferences in Movie Recommendation Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems play a vital role in helping users discover content in streaming services, but their effectiveness depends on users understanding why items are recommended. In this study, explanations were based solely on item features rather than personalized data, simulating recommendation scenarios. We compared user perceptions of one-sided (purely positive) and two-sided (positive and negative) feature-based explanations for popular movie recommendations. Through an online study with 129 participants, we examined how explanation style affected perceived trust, transparency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. One-sided explanations consistently received higher ratings across all dimensions. Our findings suggest that in low-stakes entertainment domains such as popular movie recommendations, simpler positive explanations may be more effective. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to potential confounding factors such as item familiarity and the placement of negative information in explanations. This work provides practical insights for explanation design in recommender interfaces and highlights the importance of context in shaping user preferences.</description>

      <title>MedArabiQ: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Arabic Medical Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for various applications in healthcare. However, their efficacy in the Arabic medical domain remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and benchmarks. This study introduces MedArabiQ, a novel benchmark dataset consisting of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering. We first constructed the dataset using past medical exams and publicly available datasets. We then introduced different modifications to evaluate various LLM capabilities, including bias mitigation. We conducted an extensive evaluation with five state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5. Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs in healthcare. By establishing this benchmark and releasing the dataset, we provide a foundation for future research aimed at evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for the equitable use of generative AI in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Familiarizing with Music: Discovery Patterns for Different Music Discovery Needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans have the tendency to discover and explore. This natural tendency is reflected in data from streaming platforms as the amount of previously unknown content accessed by users. Additionally, in domains such as that of music streaming there is evidence that recommending novel content improves users' experience with the platform. Therefore, understanding users' discovery patterns, such as the amount to which and the way users access previously unknown content, is a topic of relevance for both the scientific community and the streaming industry, particularly the music one. Previous works studied how music consumption differs for users of different traits and looked at diversity, novelty, and consistency over time of users' music preferences. However, very little is known about how users discover and explore previously unknown music, and how this behavior differs for users of varying discovery needs. In this paper we bridge this gap by analyzing data from a survey answered by users of the major music streaming platform Deezer in combination with their streaming data. We first address questions regarding whether users who declare a higher interest in unfamiliar music listen to more diverse music, have more stable music preferences over time, and explore more music within a same time window, compared to those who declare a lower interest. We then investigate which type of music tracks users choose to listen to when they explore unfamiliar music, identifying clear patterns of popularity and genre representativeness that vary for users of different discovery needs.
  Our findings open up possibilities to infer users' interest in unfamiliar music from streaming data as well as possibilities to develop recommender systems that guide users in exploring music in a more natural way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community health workers (CHWs) provide last-mile healthcare services but face challenges due to limited medical knowledge and training. This paper describes the design, deployment, and evaluation of ASHABot, an LLM-powered, experts-in-the-loop, WhatsApp-based chatbot to address the information needs of CHWs in India. Through interviews with CHWs and their supervisors and log analysis, we examine factors affecting their engagement with ASHABot, and ASHABot's role in addressing CHWs' informational needs. We found that ASHABot provided a private channel for CHWs to ask rudimentary and sensitive questions they hesitated to ask supervisors. CHWs trusted the information they received on ASHABot and treated it as an authoritative resource. CHWs' supervisors expanded their knowledge by contributing answers to questions ASHABot failed to answer, but were concerned about demands on their workload and increased accountability. We emphasize positioning LLMs as supplemental fallible resources within the community healthcare ecosystem, instead of as replacements for supervisor support.</description>

      <title>Motion Design Principles for Accessible Video-based Learning: Addressing Cognitive Challenges for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) learners face unique challenges in video-based learning due to the complex interplay between visual and auditory information in videos. Traditional approaches to making video content accessible primarily focus on captioning, but these solutions often neglect the cognitive demands of processing both visual and textual information simultaneously. This paper introduces a set of \textit{Motion} design guidelines, aimed at mitigating these cognitive challenges and improving video learning experiences for DHH learners. Through a two-phase research, we identified five key challenges, including misaligned content and visual overload. We proposed five design principles accordingly. User study with 16 DHH participants showed that improving visual-audio relevance and guiding visual attention significantly enhances the learning experience by reducing physical demand, alleviating temporal pressure, and improving learning satisfaction. Our findings highlight the potential of Motion design to transform educational content for DHH learners, and we discuss implications for inclusive video learning tools.</description>

      <title>CounterQuill: Investigating the Potential of Human-AI Collaboration in Online Counterspeech Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online hate speech has become increasingly prevalent on social media platforms, causing harm to individuals and society. While efforts have been made to combat this issue through content moderation, the potential of user-driven counterspeech as an alternative solution remains underexplored. Existing counterspeech methods often face challenges such as fear of retaliation and skill-related barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce CounterQuill, an AI-mediated system that assists users in composing effective and empathetic counterspeech. CounterQuill provides a three-step process: (1) a learning session to help users understand hate speech and counterspeech; (2) a brainstorming session that guides users in identifying key elements of hate speech and exploring counterspeech strategies; and (3) a co-writing session that enables users to draft and refine their counterspeech with CounterQuill. We conducted a within-subjects user study with 20 participants to evaluate CounterQuill in comparison to ChatGPT. Results show that CounterQuill's guidance and collaborative writing process provided users a stronger sense of ownership over their co-authored counterspeech. Users perceived CounterQuill as a writing partner and thus were more willing to post the co-written counterspeech online compared to the one written with ChatGPT.</description>

Abstract: Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) is revolutionizing collaboration across domains such as defense, healthcare, and autonomous systems by integrating AI-driven decision-making, trust calibration, and adaptive teaming. This survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of HMT, analyzing theoretical models, including reinforcement learning, instance-based learning, and interdependence theory, alongside interdisciplinary methodologies. Unlike prior reviews, we examine team cognition, ethical AI, multi-modal interactions, and real-world evaluation frameworks. Key challenges include explainability, role allocation, and scalable benchmarking. We propose future research in cross-domain adaptation, trust-aware AI, and standardized testbeds. By bridging computational and social sciences, this work lays a foundation for resilient, ethical, and scalable HMT systems.</description>

      <title>Catch Me if You Search: When Contextual Web Search Results Affect the Detection of Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While we increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, these models are known to produce inaccurate content or `hallucinations' with potentially disastrous consequences. The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.</description>

      <title>Exploring Families' Use and Mediation of Generative AI: A Multi-User Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applications of Generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, have gained popularity among the public due to their ease of access, use, and support of educational and creative activities. Despite these benefits, GenAI poses unique risks for families, such as lacking sufficient safeguards tailored to protect children under 16 years of age and not offering parental control features. This study explores families' use and co-use of GenAI, the perceived risks and opportunities of ChatGPT, and how parents mediate their children's use of GenAI. Through semi-structured interviews with 12 families, we identified ways families used and mediated GenAI and factors that influenced parents' GenAI mediation strategies. We contextualize our findings with a modified model of family mediation strategies, drawing from previous family media and mediation frameworks. We provide insights for future research on family-GenAI interactions and highlight the need for more robust protective measures on GenAI platforms for families.</description>

Abstract: AI-supported writing technologies (AISWT) that provide grammatical suggestions, autocomplete sentences, or generate and rewrite text are now a regular feature integrated into many people's workflows. However, little is known about how people perceive the suggestions these tools provide. In this paper, we investigate how Black American users perceive AISWT, motivated by prior findings in natural language processing that highlight how the underlying large language models can contain racial biases. Using interviews and observational user studies with 13 Black American users of AISWT, we found a strong tradeoff between the perceived benefits of using AISWT to enhance their writing style and feeling like "it wasn't built for us". Specifically, participants reported AISWT's failure to recognize commonly used names and expressions in African American Vernacular English, experiencing its corrections as hurtful and alienating and fearing it might further minoritize their culture. We end with a reflection on the tension between AISWT that fail to include Black American culture and language, and AISWT that attempt to mimic it, with attention to accuracy, authenticity, and the production of social difference.</description>

      <title>CleAR: Robust Context-Guided Generative Lighting Estimation for Mobile Augmented Reality</title>

Abstract: High-quality environment lighting is essential for creating immersive mobile augmented reality (AR) experiences. However, achieving visually coherent estimation for mobile AR is challenging due to several key limitations in AR device sensing capabilities, including low camera FoV and limited pixel dynamic ranges. Recent advancements in generative AI, which can generate high-quality images from different types of prompts, including texts and images, present a potential solution for high-quality lighting estimation. Still, to effectively use generative image diffusion models, we must address two key limitations of content quality and slow inference. In this work, we design and implement a generative lighting estimation system called CleAR that can produce high-quality, diverse environment maps in the format of 360{\deg} HDR images. Specifically, we design a two-step generation pipeline guided by AR environment context data to ensure the output aligns with the physical environment's visual context and color appearance. To improve the estimation robustness under different lighting conditions, we design a real-time refinement component to adjust lighting estimation results on AR devices. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that CleAR outperforms state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods on both estimation accuracy, latency, and robustness, and is rated by 31 participants as producing better renderings for most virtual objects. For example, CleAR achieves 51% to 56% accuracy improvement on virtual object renderings across objects of three distinctive types of materials and reflective properties. CleAR produces lighting estimates of comparable or better quality in just 3.2 seconds -- over 110X faster than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>VR-Doh: Hands-on 3D Modeling in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce VR-Doh, an open-source, hands-on 3D modeling system that enables intuitive creation and manipulation of elastoplastic objects in Virtual Reality (VR). By customizing the Material Point Method (MPM) for real-time simulation of hand-induced large deformations and enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting for seamless rendering, VR-Doh provides an interactive and immersive 3D modeling experience. Users can naturally sculpt, deform, and edit objects through both contact- and gesture-based hand-object interactions. To achieve real-time performance, our system incorporates localized simulation techniques, particle-level collision handling, and the decoupling of physical and appearance representations, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions. VR-Doh supports both object creation and editing, enabling diverse modeling tasks such as designing food items, characters, and interlocking structures, all resulting in simulation-ready assets. User studies with both novice and experienced participants highlight the system's intuitive design, immersive feedback, and creative potential. Compared to existing geometric modeling tools, VR-Doh offers enhanced accessibility and natural interaction, making it a powerful tool for creative exploration in VR.</description>

      <title>Self-reflecting Large Language Models: A Hegelian Dialectical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14917v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating NLP through a philosophical lens has recently caught researcher's eyes as it connects computational methods with classical schools of philosophy. This paper introduces a philosophical approach inspired by the \textit{Hegelian Dialectic} for LLMs' \textit{self-reflection}, utilizing a self-dialectical approach to emulate internal critiques and then synthesize new ideas by resolving the opposing points of view. Moreover, this paper investigates the effect of LLMs' temperature for generation by establishing a dynamic annealing approach, which promotes the creativity in the early stages and gradually refines it by focusing on the nuances, as well as a fixed-temperature strategy for generation. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating novel ideas and in improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs during problem-solving. Moreover, we implement a Multi-Agent Majority Voting (MAMV) strategy to assess the validity and novelty of the generated ideas, which proves useful in the absence of domain experts. Our experiments demonstrate promising results in generating ideas and enhancing problem-solving performance.</description>

      <title>CALLM: Understanding Cancer Survivors' Emotions and Intervention Opportunities via Mobile Diaries and Context-Aware Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer survivors face unique emotional challenges that impact their quality of life. Mobile diary entries provide a promising method for tracking emotional states, improving self-awareness, and promoting well-being outcome. This paper aims to, through mobile diaries, understand cancer survivors' emotional states and key variables related to just-in-time intervention opportunities, including the desire to regulate emotions and the availability to engage in interventions. Although emotion analysis tools show potential for recognizing emotions from text, current methods lack the contextual understanding necessary to interpret brief mobile diary narratives. Our analysis of diary entries from cancer survivors (N=407) reveals systematic relationships between described contexts and emotional states, with administrative and health-related contexts associated with negative affect and regulation needs, while leisure activities promote positive emotions. We propose CALLM, a Context-Aware framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze these brief entries by integrating retrieved peer experiences and personal diary history. CALLM demonstrates strong performance with balanced accuracies reaching 72.96% for positive affect, 73.29% for negative affect, 73.72% for emotion regulation desire, and 60.09% for intervention availability, outperforming language model baselines. Post-hoc analysis reveals that model confidence strongly predicts accuracy, with longer diary entries generally enhancing performance, and brief personalization periods yielding meaningful improvements. Our findings demonstrate how contextual information in mobile diaries can be effectively leveraged to understand emotional experiences, predict key states, and identify optimal intervention moments for personalized just-in-time support.</description>
